AB  - Limitation in the availability of natural resources like water is the main drive 
      for focussing on resource recovery from wastewater. Rapid urbanization with
      increased consumption of natural resources has severely affected its management
      and security. The application of biotechnological processes offers a feasible
      approach to concentrating and transforming wastewater for resource recovery and a
      step towards a circular economy. Wastewater generally contains high organic
      materials, nutrients, metals and chemicals, which have economic value. Hence, its
      management can be a valuable resource through the implementation of a paradigm
      transformation for value-added product recovery. This review focuses on the
      circular economy of "close loop" process by wastewater reuse and energy recovery 
      identifying the emerging technologies for recovering resources across the
      wastewater treatment phase. Conventional wastewater treatment technologies have
      been discussed along with the advanced treatment technologies such as algal
      treatment, anammox technology, microbial fuel cells (MFC). Apart from recovering 
      energy in the form of biogas and biohydrogen, second and third-generation
      biofuels as well as biohythane and electricity generation have been deliberated. 
      Other options for resource recovery are single-cell protein (SCP), biopolymers as
      well as recovery of metals and nutrients. The paper also highlights the
      applications of treated wastewater in agriculture, aquaponics, fisheries and
      algal cultivation. The concept of Partitions-release-recover (PRR) has been
      discussed for a better understanding of the filtration treatment coupled with
      anaerobic digestion. The review provides a critical evaluation on the importance 
      of adopting a circular economy and their role in achieving sustainable
      development goals (SDGs). Thus, it is imperative that such initiatives towards
      resource recovery from wastewater through integration of concepts can aid in
      providing wastewater treatment system with resource efficiency.

AB  - Napier grass found to be greatest potential for gaseous bioenergy production. The
      biohydrogen and biomethane productions from untreated Napier grass in single and 
      two-stage continuous bioreactors was evaluated using anaerobic digestion
      technology. The bioreactors were fed Napier grass with organic loading rate (OLR)
      of 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 kg VS/m(3)-d, respectively. The hydrogen, methane, and energy
      yields were evaluated. The methane yield of single-stage system was 282.08 CH4/g 
      VS with OLR of 0.5 kg VS/m(3)-d. For two-stage system, the biohydrogen and
      biomethane yields were 90.06 mL H2/g VS and 367.00 mL CH4/g VS with OLRs of 1.0
      and 0.5 kg VS/m(3)-d, respectively. The energy yields of single and two-stage
      systems were 13.14 and 10.10 kJ/g VS, respectively. The peak OLR of Napier grass 
      was 0.5 kg VS/m(3)-d for the two-stage system whereas the total energy recovery
      was 30% higher than the single-stage system.

      Rhodopseudomonas palustris.
LID - 344 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/bioengineering9080344 [doi]
AB  - A thermosiphon photobioreactor (TPBR) can potentially be used for biohydrogen
      production, circumventing the requirement for external mixing energy inputs. In
      this study, a TPBR is evaluated for photofermentative hydrogen production by
      Rhodopseudomonas palustris (R. palustris). Experiments were conducted in a TPBR, 
      and response surface methodology (RSM), varying biomass concentration, and light 
      intensity and temperature were employed to determine the operating conditions for
      the enhancement of both hydrogen production as well as biomass suspension.
      Biomass concentration was found to have had the most pronounced effect on both
      hydrogen production as well as biomass suspension. RSM models predicted maximum
      specific hydrogen production rates of 0.17 mol m(-3)h(-1) and 0.21 mmol
      gCDW(-1)h(-1) at R. palustris concentrations of 1.21 and 0.4 g L(-1),
      respectively. The experimentally measured hydrogen yield was in the range of 45
      to 77% (+/-3.8%), and the glycerol consumption was 8 to 19% (+/-0.48). At a
      biomass concentration of 0.40 g L(-1), the highest percentage of biomass (72.3%),
      was predicted to remain in suspension in the TPBR. Collectively, the proposed
      novel photobioreactor was shown to produce hydrogen as well as passively
      circulate biomass.

AB  - Biohydrogen productions from xylose and glucose under dark condition were
      enhanced by the presence of natural Fe3O4. The electron equivalent of H2
      fractions accounted for 4.55% and 5.69% of the total given xylose and glucose in 
      the experiments without Fe3O4, and that were correspondingly increased to 5.14%
      and 6.50% in the experiments with 100 mg L(-1) of Fe3O4, respectively. Moreover, 
      Fe3O4 increased the total intracellular NAD(H) concentrations by 8.84% and 8.37%,
      and boosted the ratios of NADH/NAD(+) by 8.33% and 17.72% in xylose and glucose
      fermentation, respectively, comparing to the corresponding control experiments.
      The formation of electron couples of Fe(III)/Fe(II) during the iron oxide
      respiration and more generation of active extracellular polymeric substances
      components were determined as the important reasons for the improved biohydrogen 
      production performance. Thus, a promotion mechanism of the internal "driving
      forces" from extracellular iron oxide respiration on the biohydrogen production
      was proposed.

AB  - Dark fermentation (DF) is a green hydrogen (H2) production process, but it is far
      below the theoretical H2 yield. In this study, calcium ferrite nanoparticles
      (CaFe2O4 NPs) were produced to augment H2 yield via DF. The highest H2 yield of
      250.1 +/- 6.5 mL/g glucose was achieved at 100 mg/L CaFe2O4 NPs.
      Furtherincreasein CaFe2O4 NPs above 100 mg/L, such as 600 mg/L, would slightly
      lower H2 yield to 208.6 +/- 2.6 mL/g glucose. The CaFe2O4 NPs in DF system
      released calcium and iron ions, promoting granular sludge formation andDF
      microbial activity. Soluble metabolites revealed that butyric acid was raised by 
      CaFe2O4 NPs, which indicated the improved metabolic pathway for more H2.
      Microbial structure composition further illustrated that CaFe2O4 NPs could
      increase the abundance of dominant microbial populations, with the supremacy of
      Firmicutes up to 71.22 % in the bioH2 evolution group augmented with 100 mg/L
      CaFe2O4 NPs.

AB  - Purple non-sulfur bacteria (PNSB) show great potential for environmental and
      industrial biotechnology, producing microbial protein, biohydrogen,
      polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), pigments, etc. When grown photoheterotrophically,
      the carbon source is typically more reduced than the PNSB biomass, which leads to
      a redox imbalance. To mitigate the excess of electrons, PNSB can exhibit several 
      'electron sinking' strategies, such as CO2 fixation, N2 fixation, and H2 and PHA 
      production. The lack of a comprehensive (over)view of these redox strategies is
      hindering the implementation of PNSB for biotechnology applications. This review 
      aims to present the state of the art of redox homeostasis in phototrophically
      grown PNSB, presenting known and theoretically expected strategies, and
      discussing them from stoichiometric, thermodynamic, metabolic, and economic
      points of view.

TI  - A mini review on microwave and contemporary based biohydrogen production
      technologies: a comparison.
LID - 10.1007/s11356-022-21979-0 [doi]
AB  - Hydrogen gas, along with conventional fossil fuels, has been used as a green fuel
      with enormous potential. Due to the rapid depletion of fossil fuels, a new
      dimension of hydrogen production technology has arrived to reduce reliance on
      nonrenewable energy sources. Microwave-based hydrogen production is a more
      promising and cost-effective technology than other existing green hydrogen
      production methods such as fermentation and gasification. Microwave heating may
      be superior to traditional heating due to several advantages such as less power
      consumption compared to other methods, higher yield, and a higher rate of
      conversion. Compared to another process for hydrogen production, the
      microwave-driven process worked efficiently at lower temperatures by providing
      more than 70% yield. The process of production can be optimized by using properly
      sized biomass, types of biomass, water flow, temperature, pressure, and reactor
      size. This method is the most suitable, attractive, and efficient technique for
      hydrogen production in the presence of a suitable catalyst. Hot spots formed by
      microwave irradiation would have a substantial impact on the yield and properties
      of microwave-processed goods. The current techno-economic situation of various
      technologies for hydrogen production is discussed here, with cost, efficiency,
      and durability being the most important factors to consider. The present review
      shows that a cost-competitive hydrogen economy will necessitate continual efforts
      to increase performance, scale-up, technical prospects, and political backing.

AB  - Residual oil in palm oil mill effluent (POME) poses difficulties in its treatment
      chain. Non-ionic surfactants containing different hydrophobic tail structures and
      their optimal concentrations were evaluated for effectiveness in biohydrogen
      production. By adding the surfactants at their critical micelle concentration in 
      synthetic oily wastewater, the maximal H2 yield was increased by 2.2 and 3.5
      times for Triton X-100 and Tergitol 15-S-9, respectively, compared to the
      control. Using real POME, the supplemental Tergitol 15-S-9 resulted in a 56.4%
      improvement in H2 production. For continuous digestion studies, pure POME and
      Tergitol 15-S-9 supplemented POME (sPOME) were fed to thermophilic anaerobic
      sequencing batch reactors (ASBRs) under hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 32-12.5
      days. Optimally at HRT 19 days, H2 content in the biogas from sPOME-fed ASBR was 
      noticeably higher, which gave a superior yield of 203.4 mLH2/gCODremoved (+15%).

      made by exoelectrogenic bacteria during electrodialysis for the separation of
      minerals and organic matters from aqueous environments. The aim of this study was

      bioelectrochemical system for separating biohydrogen production inhibitors from
      the thermophilic fermenter and thereby increasing biological and cathodic
      hydrogen production by food waste and wastewater.*Using this innovative system
      the biohydrogen production inhibitors were separated and nutrients (for example
      ammonium), alkalinity, buffering capacity and pH were preserved in the bioreactor
      at the same time, led to higher biological and cathodic hydrogen production.

AB  - The current work provides insights for improving the hydrogen output while
      degrading emerging contaminants using Rhodopseudomonas palustris. The changes in 
      the growth rate of a microorganism due to different substrate inputs affects the 
      hydrogen production due to metabolic route changes. The different ratios of
      glutamate and glycerol as nitrogen and carbon sources along with the presence of 
      ethinylestradiol (EE2) in the photofermenter affected the flux of electrons being
      directed towards biosynthesis and biohydrogen generation. The combination of
      glutamate and glycerol in different ratios (Glu:Gly; 0, 0.20 and 0.54) along with
      estrogen showed no significant difference in the bacteriochlorophyll
      concentrations. The highest biomass concentration (0.013 h(-1)) was in ratio of
      0.54 while maximum specific hydrogen production (1.9 +/- 0.05 ml g(-1) biomass
      h(-1)) was observed under complete suppression of nitrogen (0; without Glu;
      non-growing condition) with resultant improved estrogen degradation of about 78% 
      in 168 h by R. palustris strain MDOC01.

AB  - An appropriate pretreatment process is an important part of the preparation of
      biomass energy from agricultural and forestry waste. Compared to physical and
      chemical pretreatments alone, the combined ammoniated fiber explosion (AFEX) +
      hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) pretreatment process can significantly improve the
      lignin degradation rate and saccharification efficiency, thus improving the
      hydrogen production capacity during medium-temperature dark fermentation. This
      study showed that the combined pretreatment increased the saccharification
      efficiency of herbaceous, hardwood, and softwood biomass by 58.7, 39.5, and 20.6%
      and the corresponding gas production reached 145.49, 80.75, and 57.52 mL/g,
      respectively. In addition, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and
      Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy showed that AFEX + H2O2 disrupted the
      structure of the feedstock and was more favorable for lignin removal. Soluble
      metabolites indicated that AFEX + H2O2 pretreatment enhanced the butyrate
      metabolic pathway of the substrate and biohydrogen generation and increased the
      levels of extracellular polymers and microbial community structure.

AB  - Microalgae are a potential feedstock for several bioproducts, mainly from its
      primary and secondary metabolites. Lipids can be converted in high-value
      polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) such as omega-3, carbohydrates are potential
      biohydrogen (bioH2) sources, proteins can be converted into biopolymers (such as 
      bioplastics) and pigments can achieve high concentrations of valuable
      carotenoids. This work comprehends the current practices for the production of
      such products from microalgae biomass, with insights on technical performance,
      environmental and economical sustainability. For each bioproduct, discussion
      includes insights on bioprocesses, productivity, commercialization, environmental
      impacts and major challenges. Opportunities for future research, such as
      wastewater cultivation, arise as environmentally attractive alternatives for
      sustainable production with high potential for resource recovery and
      valorization. Still, microalgae biotechnology stands out as an attractive topic
      for it research and market potential.

AB  - Peracetic acid (PAA), a widely used organic peroxide with strong disinfection and
      oxidizing effect, has recently attracted research interest in waste activated
      sludge (WAS) treatment to achieve sludge reduction and resource utilization.
      However, its impact on hydrogen accumulation from WAS dark fermentation has not
      been documented. This study therefore is intended to fill in this knowledge gap
      and clarify the underlying mechanism of PAA-promoted hydrogen generation. Batch
      experiments revealed that when raised PAA dosage from 0 to 8 mg/g TSS (total
      suspended solids), cumulative hydrogen production within 168 h fermentation
      increased from 1.3 to 14.2 mL/g VSS (volatile suspended solids), however, further
      increase PAA dosage to 10 mg/g TSS resulted in a slight decrease in hydrogen
      yield. Mechanism studies revealed that PAA was beneficial to sludge
      disintegration (10 mg/g TSS PAA increased SCOD (soluble chemical oxygen demand)
      by 254 %). Although PAA inhibited the activity of all microorganism involved in
      dark fermentation, the inhibitory effect on hydrogen consumers were much more
      serious than that on hydrogen producers (-45.8 % versus -5.1 % and - 7.3 %). The 
      fermentation was found to shift from propionate type to acetate and butyrate
      type, favoring hydrogen production. Moreover, the methane production process was 
      effectively inhibited by PAA, which meant less hydrogen consumption. Microbial
      community analysis results unveiled that PAA increased the abundances of
      hydrolytic bacteria (e.g., norank_f__Saprospiraceae) and hydrogen producers
      (e.g., Clostridium_sensu_stricto_10). These findings obtained in this work
      provide new insights into oxidants-involved sludge treatment process and might
      have important implication for WAS treatment and bioenergy production in the
      future.

AB  - The biohydrogen production from algal biomass could ensure hydrogen's
      sustainability as a fuel option at the industrial level. However, some
      bottlenecks still need to be overcome to achieve the process's economic
      feasibility. This review article highlights the potential of algal biomasses for 
      producing hydrogen with a detailed explanation of various mechanisms and enzymes 
      involved in the production processes. Further, it discusses the impact of various
      experimental parameters on biohydrogen production. This article also analyses the
      significant challenges confronted during the overall biohydrogen production
      process and comprehends the recent strategies adopted to enhance hydrogen
      productivity. Furthermore, it gives a perception of the economic sustenance of
      the process. Moreover, this review elucidates the future scope of this technology
      and delineates the approaches to ensure the viability of hydrogen production.

AB  - Energy efficient and environment friendly pretreatment processes for the
      production of biofuel have remained elusive and the research is further
      compounded by the high cost of processing lignocellulosic biomass-an essential
      factor for producing sustainable biofuels. In the last few decades, a number of
      pretreatment methods have been proposed, specifically chemical pretreatments but 
      are either expensive or harmful to the environment. To address this urgent need, 
      we propose a green pretreatment method that utilises the highly alkaline
      by-product, petha wastewater to pretreat the lignocellulosic waste rice straw
      (RS). The effectiveness of the pretreatment was analysed by monitoring both
      enhanced cellulose content and reducing sugar yield along with removal of
      hemicellulose and lignin. We found that PWW pretreatment yielded five times more 
      reducing sugar than native RS with 10.12% increment in cellulose content. SEM and
      EDX studies further revealed that our process enhanced surface roughness and
      carbon content (from 32.19% increased to 41.59% and 41.66% for A and D,
      respectively) along with reduction in silica content (from 8.68% in RS to 4.30%
      and 7.72% for A and D, respectively). XRD and FTIR analyses indicate
      crystallinity index (CI) and alteration in lignocellulosic structure of RS,
      respectively. Decrease in CI was about 43.4% in A whereas only 4.5% in D as
      compared to native RS (CI 54.55%). Thereby we found PWW to be better substitute
      of an alkali for pretreatment of RS with negligible environmental impacts.

TI  - Current trends in solid tannery waste management.
PG  - 1-18
LID - 10.1080/07388551.2022.2068996 [doi]
AB  - The tannery is one of the leading revenue-generating sectors in developing
      countries. The ever-increasing demand for leather products in the global market
      requires converting large amounts of rawhide/skins into resilient non-putrescible
      finished leather. Only 20% of the raw material is converted into a finished
      product; the rest 80% is discarded as solid and liquid wastes during leather
      processing. A heavy discharge of improperly treated solid tannery waste (STW)
      causes a severe impact on the surrounding environment by polluting soil, surface 
      water, and groundwater resources, posing severe hazards to human and animal
      health. STW comprises proteinaceous untanned and tanned waste, which requires
      proper treatment for eco-friendly disposal. Several strategies have been
      developed over the years for the reduction and recycling of STW for producing
      renewable energy (biogas and biohydrogen), biofuels (biodiesel and briquettes),
      construction material, fertilizers, commercial products (adsorbents, animal
      feeds, proteins, fats, and enzymes), and biodegradable packaging and
      non-packaging materials. In this review, we discuss various strategies adopted
      for recycling, reutilization, and reduction of STW in an environment-friendly
      manner. Furthermore, an overview of the current perspectives toward achieving a
      zero-waste policy is also presented to reduce the environmental burden using
      green-clean technology to aid the survival of present-day tanneries.

TI  - Novel strategies towards efficient molecular biohydrogen production by dark
      fermentative mechanism: present progress and future perspective.
LID - 10.1007/s00449-022-02738-4 [doi]
AB  - In the scenario of alarming increase in greenhouse and toxic gas emissions from
      the burning of conventional fuels, it is high time that the population drifts
      towards alternative fuel usage to obviate pollution. Hydrogen is an
      environment-friendly biofuel with high energy content. Several production methods
      exist to produce hydrogen, but the least energy intensive processes are the
      fermentative biohydrogen techniques. Dark fermentative biohydrogen production
      (DFBHP) is a value-added, less energy-consuming process to generate biohydrogen. 
      In this process, biohydrogen can be produced from sugars as well as complex
      substrates that are generally considered as organic waste. Yet, the process is
      constrained by many factors such as low hydrogen yield, incomplete conversion of 
      substrates, accumulation of volatile fatty acids which lead to the drop of the
      system pH resulting in hindered growth and hydrogen production by the bacteria.
      To circumvent these drawbacks, researchers have come up with several strategies
      that improve the yield of DFBHP process. These strategies can be classified as
      preliminary methodologies concerned with the process optimization and the latter 
      that deals with pretreatment of substrate and seed sludge, bioaugmentation,
      co-culture of bacteria, supplementation of additives, bioreactor design
      considerations, metabolic engineering, nanotechnology, immobilization of
      bacteria, etc. This review sums up some of the improvement techniques that
      profoundly enhance the biohydrogen productivity in a DFBHP process.

AB  - A conductive metal compound can be used as a catalyst for enhancing hydrogen
      production by dark fermentation. This study aimed to identify mechanisms of
      enhanced hydrogen production by magnetite supplementation. Experiments were
      performed with lactate and/or magnetite supplementation to confirm that the
      lactate-utilizing pathway is the key cause of enhanced hydrogen production. Also,
      ribonucleic acid sample was collected for monitoring gene regulation under each
      condition. Hydrogen production was significantly enhanced by approximately 25.6% 
      and 58.9%, respectively, via magnetite alone and with lactate. Moreover, the
      expression of genes involved in hydrogen production, including pyruvate
      ferredoxin oxidoreductase, hydrogenase, and ferredoxin, via magnetite alone and
      with lactate was upregulated by 0.26, 0.71, and 3.50 and 1.06, 2.14, and 1.94
      times, respectively.

AB  - The study explored the spent wash valorisation into value added biobased products
      viz. volatile fatty acids (VFAs), biohydrogen (bio-H2), methane (CH4) and
      biohythane (bio-H-CNG) based on eight selected parameters employing design of
      experiment (DOE) approach. Selectively enriched biocatalyst showed marked
      influence on the production of acidogenic products (bio-H2 and VFA) while
      untreated inoculum resulted in higher CH4 and bio-H-CNG generation. CaCO3 showed 
      potential for butyric acid (HBu) production while Na2CO3 specifically yielded
      higher acetic acid (HAc) when supplemented as buffering agents. Higher degree of 
      acidification (DOA; 49.8%) was observed at lower organic load (OL; 30 g/L).
      Biogas production and profile was influenced by OL, enrichment of biocatalyst and
      supplemented buffering agent. Higher OL related to higher bioproduct production, 
      while yields of the respective products were higher at lower OL.

TI  - Identification of major carotenoids from green alga Tetraspora sp. CU2551:
      partial purification and characterization of lutein, canthaxanthin, neochrome,

PG  - 129

AB  - The green algae Tetraspora sp. CU2551 was previously identified as a strain with 
      high potential for biohydrogen production; however, its algal biomass
      characteristics changed from green to reddish orange within 43 days of
      biohydrogen production. The crude pigments were extracted, partially purified,
      and characterized by chemical determination. The present study focused on
      elucidating the carotenoid composition of the selected green alga Tetraspora sp. 
      CU2551. The pigment extract was partially purified and fractionated using thin
      layer chromatography, and yielded two major and two minor carotenoid bands. The
      fractions were confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography with a diode
      array detector (HPLC-DAD) before being identified and confirmed using Liquid
      Chromatograph-Quadrupole Time of Flight-Mass Spectrometry (LC-QTOF-MS). The
      spectral data of these fractions revealed four sub-fractions of interest that
      were lutein, canthaxanthin, neochrome, and beta-carotene, which had percentages
      in the crude extracts of 30.57%, 25.47%, 7.89%, and 0.71%, respectively. Lutein
      and canthaxanthin were found to be the major carotenoid pigments present. Our
      findings in this present study are the first reporting of Tetraspora sp. CU2551
      as a potential alternate source for carotenoid pigment production.

AB  - Urbanization and pollution are the major issues of the current time own to the
      exhaustive consumption of fossil fuels which have a detrimental effect on the
      nation's economies and air quality due to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and
      shortage of energy reserves. Algae, an autotrophic organism provides a green
      substitute for energy as well as commercial products. Algal extracts become an
      efficient source for bioactive compounds having anti-microbial, anti-oxidative,
      anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancerous potential. Besides the conventional
      approach, residual biomass from any algal-based process might act as a renewable 
      substrate for fermentation. Likewise, lignocellulosic biomass, algal biomass can 
      also be processed for sugar recovery by different pre-treatment strategies like
      acid and alkali hydrolysis, microwave, ionic liquid, and ammonia fiber explosion,
      etc. Residual algal biomass hydrolysate can be used as a feedstock to produce
      bioenergy (biohydrogen, biogas, methane) and biochemicals (organic acids,
      polyhydroxyalkanoates) via microbial fermentation.

PG  - 906968
LID - 10.3389/fbioe.2022.906968 [doi]
AB  - Clean- and high-value recovery and reuse of the residue of biohydrogen production
      (biohydrogen slurry) is an urgent problem to be solved. In this study, sodium
      alginate (SA) gel was used to concentrate nutrients quickly in situ from
      biohydrogen slurry, which was prepared into gel microspheres (GMs), just like
      "capsule." The immobilization and release efficiency of conventional and reverse 
      spherification were investigated. Better immobilization and release efficiency
      were detected under the conventional spherification method. The effect of GM
      sizes and concentrations of SA and calcium chloride (CaCl2) was further studied
      in terms of sphericity factor, nutrient release, yield, encapsulation efficiency,
      and loading capacity. The best immobilization effect was obtained with a 1.6-mm
      syringe needle, 3.0 wt% SA, and 6 wt% CaCl2, in which the sphericity factor,
      nitrogen release, yield, nitrogen encapsulation efficiency, and nitrogen loading 
      capacity reached to 0.047, 96.20, 77.68, 38.37, and 0.0476%, respectively. This
      process not only avoids environmental pollution from biohydrogen slurry but also 
      uses them at a high value as a fertilizer to nourish the soil. The feasibility of
      "slurry capsule" preparation will realize the clean recovery and reuse of
      biohydrogen slurry, which provides a new idea for ecological protection and
      carbon neutral goals and has important significance for sustainable development.

TI  - Emerging Trends in Genetic Engineering of Microalgae for Commercial Applications.
LID - 285 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/md20050285 [doi]
AB  - Recently, microalgal biotechnology has received increasing interests in producing
      valuable, sustainable and environmentally friendly bioproducts. The development
      of economically viable production processes entails resolving certain limitations
      of microalgal biotechnology, and fast evolving genetic engineering technologies
      have emerged as new tools to overcome these limitations. This review provides a
      synopsis of recent progress, current trends and emerging approaches of genetic
      engineering of microalgae for commercial applications, including production of
      pharmaceutical protein, lipid, carotenoids and biohydrogen, etc. Photochemistry
      improvement in microalgae and CO2 sequestration by microalgae via genetic
      engineering were also discussed since these subjects are closely entangled with
      commercial production of the above mentioned products. Although genetic
      engineering of microalgae is proved to be very effective in boosting performance 
      of production in laboratory conditions, only limited success was achieved to be
      applicable to industry so far. With genetic engineering technologies advancing
      rapidly and intensive investigations going on, more bioproducts are expected to
      be produced by genetically modified microalgae and even much more to be
      prospected.

AB  - Nearly 15 billion metric tons of fossil fuels are consumed each year all over the
      world resulting in the depletion of non-renewable energy resources day by day
      therefore in the coming years, the shortage and price hikes of these fuels are
      inevitable. On the other hand, the global energy demand is projected to rise by
      almost 28% by 2040 compared to current levels. Thus, there is a dire need for
      developing the alternatives to meet these energy needs. Biomass is seen as a
      significant alternative energy source to fossil fuels from this standpoint. The
      main bottle neck in utilizing the biomass for this purpose is the lack of an
      efficient conversion or pretreatment technology which prompted scientists to
      delve into novel stepwise biomass conversion technologies. This review article
      encompasses various methods for the processing the algal biomass to generate
      potential biobased products such as algal crude oil, biogas, and fuel alcohols.
      Among the various techniques of thermochemical conversion of algal biomass,
      hydrothermal liquefaction and gasification are the most sustainable ones.
      Furthermore, anaerobic digestion of lignocellulosic biomass is the commercially
      workable technique providing biogas and biohydrogen. Future generations may find 
      algal biofuels to be low-cost and ecologically benign alternative to fossil
      fuels. This review is a connotative illustration of the conversion technologies
      for algal biomass, which includes both thermochemical and biochemical processes. 
      It also highlights the salient features along with the limitations of each of
      these technologies and bearing in mind the expansion of a superstructure
      depiction to capture the various biomass feedstocks and employment techniques for
      the generated bioenergy through various biomass conversion technologies.

AB  - Clean energy like hydrogen can be a promising strategy to solve problems of
      global warming. Photo-fermentation (PF) is an attractive technology for producing
      biohydrogen from various biowastes cost-effectively and environmentally friendly.
      However, challenges of low light conversion efficiency and small yields of
      biohydrogen production still limit its application. Thus, advanced strategies
      have been investigated to enhance photo-fermentative biohydrogen production. This
      review discusses advanced technologies that show positive outcomes in improving
      biohydrogen production by PF, including the following. Firstly, genetic
      engineering enhances light transfer efficiency, change the activity of enzymes,
      and improves the content of ATP, ammonium and antibiotic tolerance of
      photosynthetic bacteria. Secondly, immobilization technology is refined. Thirdly,
      nanotechnology makes great strides as a scientific technique and fourthly,
      integration of dark and photo-fermentation technology is possible. Some
      suggestions for further studies to achieve high levels of efficiency of
      photo-fermentative biohydrogen production are mentioned in this paper.

AB  - Biochar is a widely used antecedent for improving biohydrogen production.
      However, little is known about the impact of biochar-derived dissolved organic
      matter (DOM) on the performance of fermentative bio-H2 production. Herein, we
      evaluated the impact of biochar-derived DOM on the fermentation performance of
      hydrogen-producing microflora. The pyrolysis temperature of biochar affected the 
      DOM composition, with lower pyrolysis temperatures showing more serious
      inhibition on H2 accumulation. When biochar was pyrolyzed at 500 degrees C, DOM
      prolonged the fermentation period and decreased H2 production from 1330.41 mL
      L(-1) to 1177.05 mL L(-1) compared to the control group. The xylose utilization
      in mixed substrate decreased from 29.72% to 26.41%, which is not favorable for
      practical applications where lignocellulosic biomass is used as a substrate.
      Otherwise, DOM caused a 6% reduction in microbial biomass accumulation and less
      soluble metabolites formation. The potential mechanism of DOM inhibiting
      biohydrogen production was verified by identifying an increase in reactive oxygen
      species (ROS) level (178.2%) and the microbial community shifted to containing
      fewer hydrogen-producing strains. The finding prompts a more precise design of
      biochar applications in fermentation systems to alleviate the potential hazards
      and maximum the fermentation performance, not limited to fermentative hydrogen
      production system.

TI  - A Review on Opportunities and Limitations of Membrane Bioreactor Configuration in
      Biofuel Production.
LID - 10.1007/s12010-022-03955-z [doi]
AB  - Biofuels are a clean and renewable source of energy that has gained more
      attention in recent years; however, high energy input and processing cost during 
      the production and recovery process restricted its progress. Membrane technology 
      offers a range of energy-saving separation for product recovery and purification 
      in biorefining along with biofuel production processes. Membrane separation
      techniques in combination with different biological processes increase cell
      concentration in the bioreactor, reduce product inhibition, decrease chemical
      consumption, reduce energy requirements, and further increase product
      concentration and productivity. Certain membrane bioreactors have evolved with
      the ability to deal with different biological production and separation processes
      to make them cost-effective, but there are certain limitations. The present
      review describes the advantages and limitations of membrane bioreactors to
      produce different biofuels with the ability to simplify upstream and downstream
      processes in terms of sustainability and economics.

TI  - Sequential Dark-Photo Batch Fermentation and Kinetic Modelling for Biohydrogen
      Production Using Cheese Whey as a Feedstock.
LID - 10.1007/s12010-022-03958-w [doi]
AB  - The present work describes the utilisation of cheese whey to produce biohydrogen 
      by sequential dark-photo fermentation. In first stage, cheese whey was fermented 
      by Enterobacter aerogenes 2822 cells in a 2 L double-walled cylindrical
      bioreactor to produce hydrogen/organic acids giving maximum biohydrogen yield and
      cumulative hydrogen of 2.43 +/- 0.12 mol mol(-1) lactose and 3270 +/- 143.5 mL at
      cheese whey concentration of 105 mM lactose L(-1). The soluble metabolites of
      dark fermentation when utilised as carbon source for photo fermentation by
      Rhodobacter sphaeroides O.U.001, the yield, and cumulative hydrogen was increased
      to 4.22 +/- 0.20 mol mol(-1) VFA and 3800 +/- 170 mL, respectively. Meanwhile, an
      overall COD removal of about 38.08% was also achieved. The overall biohydrogen
      yield was increased from 2.43 (dark fermentation) to 6.65 +/- 0.25 mol mol(-1)
      lactose. Similarly, the modelling for biohydrogen production in bioreactor was
      done using modified Gompertz equation and Leudeking-Piret model, which gave
      adequate simulated fitting with the experimental values. The carbon material
      balance showed that acetic acid, lactic acid, and CO2 along with microbial
      biomass were the main by-products of dark fermentation and comprised more than
      75% of carbon consumed.

AB  - This study assessed the effect of hydraulic retention time (HRT) ranging from 24 
      to 3 h on continuous dark-fermentative H2 production in four bioreactors operated
      at pH 5.0, 5.5, 6.0 and 6.5. A mixture of cellobiose, xylose and arabinose was
      used as the substrate. The highest hydrogen production rate between HRTs of 24
      and 12 h was observed at pH 6.5, while at HRT below 12 h at pH 6.0. At a HRT of 3
      h it reached 11.4 L H2/L-d. Thus, the optimum pH for H2 production depends on the
      HRT. The highest sugar utilization was obtained at pH 6.0 and 6.5 and decreased
      in the following order: cellobiose > xylose > arabinose. The pH conditions, in
      contrast to HRT, were found to have a significant influence on the bacterial
      composition. Low diversity in bacterial culture dominated by the Clostridium
      genus allows for stable and high H2 production performance.

AB  - Overcoming the existing environmental issues and the gradual depletion of energy 
      sources is a priority at global level, biohydrogen can provide a sustainable and 
      reliable energy reserve. However, the process instability and low biohydrogen
      yields are still hindering the adoption of biohydrogen production plants at
      industrial scale. In this context, membrane-based biohydrogen production
      technologies, and in particular fermentative membrane bioreactors (MBRs) and
      microbial electrolysis cells (MECs), as well as downstream membrane-based
      technologies such as electrodialysis (ED), are suitable options to achieve
      high-rate biohydrogen production. We have shed the light on the research efforts 
      towards the development of membrane-based technologies for biohydrogen production
      from organic waste, with special emphasis to the reactor design and materials.
      Besides, techno-economic analyses have been traced to ensure the suitability of
      such technologies in bio-H2 production. Operation parameters such as pH,
      temperature and organic loading rate affect the performance of MBRs. MEC and ED
      technologies also are highly affected by the chemistry of the membrane used and
      anode material as well as the operation parameters. The limitations and future
      directions for application of membrane-based biohydrogen production technologies 
      have been individuated. At the end, this review helps in the critical
      understanding of deploying membrane-based technologies for biohydrogen
      production, thereby encouraging future outcomes for a sustainable biohydrogen
      economy.

AB  - Generation of excess sludge in large quantities from wastewater treatment plant
      face huge problem in terms of handling and management, whereas it possess higher 
      organic and inorganic constituents and thus it can be used as a feedstock for the
      generation of biofuel with proper disintegration techniques.In this regard, an
      effort has been made in this study to combine thermo-chemo-disperser pretreatment
      for the disintegration of paper mill waste activated sludge for the production of
      biohydrogen in an energy efficient way. These combinations of
      thermo-chemo-disperser (TCD) tend to be effective in disintegration and possess
      24.3% COD solubilization and higher suspended solid reduction of 18.8% at the
      specific energy usage of 2081.82 kJ/kg TS. The pretreatment with TCD technique
      shows the biohydrogen production of 120.2 mLH2/gCOD as compared to
      thermochemically pretreated alone (73.6 mLH2/gCOD) sample. Thus, the combined
      process was considered to be potentially effective in sludge disintegration.

AB  - The goal of this research was to study the role of excess charges in regulating
      biohydrogen production from Paulownia. The excess charges were generated through 
      charge compensation in SnO2 nanocatalysts by Zn doping. The maximum hydrogen
      yield of 335 mL was observed at 8%Zn doping with a concentration of 150 mg/L, 47%
      higher as compared to standard sample. It was observed that the hydrogen
      production rate increased with Zn doping and the highest value (77 mL/h) was
      observed for 8%Zn at 24 h. The decrease in the total amount of byproducts (2.52
      g/L from 4.28 g/L) at 8% Zn indicates an increase in bacterial metabolism. The
      lowest value of oxidation-reduction potential (-525 mV) at 24 h for 8%Zn confirms
      that Zn doping provides excessive electrons to the fermentative medium which
      helps the bacteria to transfer electrons faster during the redox reaction, hence,
      enhancing the enzymatic process and eventually hydrogen production.

AB  - The combination pretreatment strategy is an effective way to intensify
      photo-fermentative biohydrogen production (PFHP) process. In this study, the
      synergistic effects of microwave irradiation and surfactants on the hydrogen
      production performance, energy analysis and structural characteristics was
      evaluated. Results revealed that hydrogen production performance was improved
      after microwave irradiation pretreatment (MIP) and surfactants assisted microwave
      irradiation pretreatment (SMIP). SMIP group had a higher cumulative hydrogen
      yield (CHY) of 367.87 +/- 6.481 mL compared with control group (223.26 +/- 4.329 
      mL) and MIP group (303.66 +/- 3.366 mL), which was an increase of 36.01% and
      64.77%, respectively. Energy evaluation analysis showed that the energy ratio of 
      SMIP (0.49) was higher than that of MIP (0.37) in the PFHP system, therefore,
      SMIP can save more energy. After SMIP, the corncob lignocellulose structure was
      greatly damaged, which was verified by SEM, FTIR, XRD and XPS analyses.

PG  - 48
LID - 10.1186/s13068-022-02147-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In times of global warming there is an urgent need to replace fossil 
      fuel-based energy vectors by less carbon dioxide (CO2)-emitting alternatives. One
      attractive option is the use of molecular hydrogen (H2) since its combustion
      emits water (H2O) and not CO2. Therefore, H2 is regarded as a non-polluting fuel.
      The ways to produce H2 can be diverse, but steam reformation of conventional
      fossil fuel sources is still the main producer of H2 gas up to date. Biohydrogen 
      production via microbes could be an alternative, environmentally friendly and
      renewable way of future H2 production, especially when the flexible and
      inexpensive C1 compound formate is used as substrate. RESULTS: In this study, the
      versatile compound formate was used as substrate to drive H2 production by whole 
      cells of the thermophilic acetogenic bacterium Thermoanaerobacter kivui which
      harbors a highly active hydrogen-dependent CO2 reductase (HDCR) to oxidize
      formate to H2 and CO2 and vice versa. Under optimized reaction conditions, T.
      kivui cells demonstrated the highest H2 production rates (qH2 = 685 mmol g(-1)
      h(-1)) which were so far reported in the literature for wild-type organisms.
      Additionally, high yields (Y(H2/formate)) of 0.86 mol mol(-1) and a hydrogen
      evolution rate (HER) of 999 mmol L(-1) h(-1) were observed. Finally, stirred-tank
      bioreactor experiments demonstrated the upscaling feasibility of the applied
      whole cell system and indicated the importance of pH control for the reaction of 
      formate-driven H2 production. CONCLUSIONS: The thermophilic acetogenic bacterium 
      T. kivui is an efficient biocatalyst for the oxidation of formate to H2 (and
      CO2). The existing genetic tool box of acetogenic bacteria bears further
      potential to optimize biohydrogen production in future and to contribute to a
      future sustainable formate/H2 bio-economy.

TI  - Co-production of Biohydrogen and Biomethane from Chicken Manure and Food Waste in
      a Two-Stage Anaerobic Fermentation Process.
PG  - 3706-3720
LID - 10.1007/s12010-022-03945-1 [doi]
AB  - Batch experiments were performed to evaluate the biohydrogen and biomethane
      production by co-digestion of chicken manure and food waste in a two-stage
      mesophilic fermentation process. Results showed that no hydrogen was produced in 
      the first stage of sole chicken manure fermentation, while methane yield was
      247.3 mL.g(-1)-VS. By comparison, the co-digestion process with food waste
      proportions of 50-85% obtained hydrogen yields of 15.5-57.5 mL.g(-1)-VS, and the 
      methane yields and maximum specific methane production rates were also improved
      by 7.0-16.7% and 80%, respectively. Moreover, the highest hydrogen and methane
      yields were achieved during sole food waste fermentation process. The acetate was
      the main volatile fatty acid (VFA) produced during sole chicken manure
      fermentation process in the first stage. Statistical analysis revealed that
      hydrogen production from co-digestion process and sole food waste fermentation
      process followed the n-butyrate-type pathway. Meanwhile, it should be noticed
      that the co-fermentation of chicken manure and food waste had antagonistic
      effects on the hydrogen fermentation, implying that there might be some
      inhibition factors existing in chicken manure or produced during the
      co-fermentation process. At the beginning of methane fermentation, the VFA
      profiles were similar to those at the end of hydrogen fermentation, and the main 
      VFA compositions changed to acetate and propionate in the latter period of
      methane production. The volatile solid removal efficiencies were also promoted in
      co-digestion process compared with sole chicken manure digestion, which were
      increased by 9.7-14.4% with food waste proportions of 50-80%.

AB  - The production of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and biohydrogen (bio-H2) from food 
      waste (FW) by acidogenic process is one of the promising strategies. The present 
      study was performed to evaluate the role of initial (phase I) and intermittent pH
      (phase II) control strategies utilising combination of sodium hydroxide (NaOH)
      and sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) as buffering/neutralizing agents on VFAs and bio-H2
      production from FW. The study was carried out in two bioreactor configurations
      (biofilm (UAFBB) and a suspended mode bioreactor (UASB)). Intermittent pH
      adjustment (phase II) increased hydrolysis and FW acidification compared to the
      initially adjusted pH (phase I), but had a detrimental influence on bio-H2
      generation in both the studied bioreactor configurations. Combining NaOH and
      Na2CO3 resulted in higher buffering capacity and VFA production. The studied
      parameters in UAFBB aided in higher VFA (14.05 g/L; 48 h of cycle operation) and 
      bio-H2 (56%; 12 h of cycle operation) production during phase II and phase I
      operation, respectively. Overall, the results showed a synergy between the
      examined parameters, resulting in increased VFA production from FW.

AB  - The impact of antibiotics on H2-producing bacteria must be considered in the
      industrialization of biological H2 production using livestock manure as raw
      resources. However, whether antibiotics that may be contained in excreta will
      threaten the safety of biohydrogen production needs to be researched. This study 
      explored the impact characteristics and mechanism of six single antibiotics and
      three groups of compound antibiotics on H2 production. Experiments confirmed that
      most antibiotics have different degrees of H2 production inhibition, while some
      antibiotics, which like Penicillin G, Streptomycin Sulfate, and their compound
      antibiotics, could promote the growth of Ethanoligenens sp. and improve H2 yield 
      on the contrary. Comprehensive analysis shows that the main inhibitory mechanisms
      were: (1) board-spectrum inhibition, (2) partial inhibition, (3) H2 consumption
      enhancement; and the enhancement mechanisms were: (1) enhance the growth of
      H2-producing bacteria, (2) enhanced starch hydrolysis, (3) inhibitory H2
      consumption or release of acid inhibition. Meanwhile, experiment found that the
      effect of antibiotics on H2 producing was not only related to type, but also to
      dosage. Even one kind of antibiotic may have completely opposite effects on
      H2-producing bacteria under different dosage conditions. Inhibition of H2 yield
      was highest with Levofloxacin at 6.15 mg/L, gas production was reduced by 88.77%;
      and enhancement of H2 yield was highest with Penicillin G at 7.20 mg/L, the gas
      production increased by 72.90%. In the selection of raw material, the type and
      content of antibiotics demand a detailed investigation and analysis to ensure
      that the sustainability of H2 yield.

AB  - Anthropogenic activities have drastically affected the environment, leading to
      increased waste accumulation in atmospheric bodies, including water. Wastewater
      treatment is an energy-consuming process and typically requires thousands of
      kilowatt hours of energy. This enormous energy demand can be fulfilled by
      utilizing the microbial electrolysis route to breakdown organic pollutants in
      wastewater which produces clean water and biohydrogen as a by-product of the
      reaction. Microalgae are the promising microorganism for the biohydrogen
      production, and it has been investigated that the interaction between microalgae 
      and bacteria can be used to boost the yield of biohydrogen. Consortium of algae
      and bacteria resulting around 50-60% more biohydrogen production compared to the 
      biohydrogen production of algae and bacteria separately. This review summarises
      the recent development in different microalgae-bacteria granular consortium
      systems successfully employed for biohydrogen generation. We also discuss the
      limitations in biohydrogen production and factors affecting its production from
      wastewater.

AB  - The use of biological processes for the treatment of asbestos cement waste (ACW) 
      has gained interest in recent years. Nevertheless, this methodology is not yet
      consolidated because of the incomplete ACW conversion during the biological
      treatment and the consequent need for further treatments that generally require a
      high amount of energy and chemicals. In this study, the efficiency of both
      mesophilic and thermophilic dark fermentation (DF) fed with glucose in fed-batch 
      conditions was assessed for ACW biological treatment. Both thermophilic and
      mesophilic DF of glucose resulted in a partial conversion of glucose into organic
      acids that successfully degraded all the asbestos fibers contained in an ACW
      sample. A hydrogen-rich biogas was produced as well: at the end of the mesophilic
      DF treatment 0.14 LH2 gglucose(-1) were obtained. In addition, the anaerobic
      digestion (AD) of the DF supernatants led to the production of 0.38 LCH4
      gCOD(-1).

AB  - Hydroxyapatite (HA) had the effect of maintaining the pH balance of the reaction 
      system and promoting enzyme activity. In this work, hydroxyapatite was
      synthesized by coprecipitation and characterized for biohydrogen (bioH2)
      production from glucose. The highest bioH2 yield obtained was 182.33 +/- 2.41
      mL/g glucose, amended with an optimal dosage of 400 mg/L HA, which was a 55.80%
      higher bioH2 yield compared with the control group without any addition. The
      results indicated that HA facilitated the deterioration of organic substances and
      increased the concentration of soluble microbial products (SMPs). Microbial
      community analysis revealed that HA significantly increased the abundance of
      Firmicutes from 35.27% (0 mg/L, HA) to 76.41% (400 mg/L, HA), which played an
      essential role in bioH2 generation. In particular, the abundance of Clostridium
      sensu stricto 1 increased from 15.33% (0 mg/L HA) to 45.17% (400 mg/L HA) and
      became the dominant bacteria. The results also indicated that HA likely improves 
      bioH2 production from organic wastewater in practice.

AB  - This study examined a two-stage dynamic membrane bioreactor (DMBR) system for
      biohydrogen and biomethane production from food waste (FW) in mesophilic
      condition. The two-stage DMBR system enabled high-rate H2 and CH4 production from
      particulate feedstock by enhanced microorganism retention. Chemical energy in FW 
      was recovered up to 79% as renewable energy. The highest average hydrogen
      production rate of 7.09 +/- 0.42 L/L-d was observed at a hydraulic retention time
      (HRT) of 8 h in the H2-DMBR, while the highest CH4 average production rate of
      0.99 +/- 0.02 L/L-d was observed at an HRT of 6 d in the CH4-DMBR. The high
      specific methanogenic activity of 71.7 mL CH4/g VSS-d was maintained at the short
      HRT, which also contributed to the high MPR. The genus Clostridium was dominant
      in the H2-DMBR, while bacterial and archaeal populations in the CH4-DMBR were
      dominated by the class Clostridia and genera Methanobacterium and Methanosaeta,
      respectively.

AB  - Agricultural residues play a pivotal role in meeting the growing energy and bulk 
      chemicals demand and food security of society. There is global concern about the 
      utilization of fossil-based fuels and chemicals which create serious
      environmental problems. Biobased sustainable fuels can afford energy and fuels
      for future generations. Agro-industrial waste materials can act as the
      alternative way for generating bioenergy and biochemicals strengthening low
      carbon economy. Processing of pineapple generates about 60% of the weight of the 
      original pineapple fruit in the form of peel, core, crown end, and pomace that
      can be converted into bioenergy sources like bioethanol, biobutanol, biohydrogen,
      and biomethane along with animal feed and vermicompost as described in this
      paper. This paper also explains about bioconversion process towards the
      production of various value-added products such as phenolic anti-oxidants,
      bromelain enzyme, phenolic flavour compounds, organic acids, and animal feed
      towards bioeconomy.

AB  - Foaming is a key issue should be solved in the process of photo-fermentation
      biohydrogen production (PFHP), since it has negative influence on the hydrogen
      yield potential, especially when taken straw as substrate. Appropriate foam
      control measures must be considered for industrialization. Hence, in this work,
      foam height and biohydrogen yield were selected as index, the effect of defoamer 
      addition on PFHP was investigated. The defoamer has no negative effect on
      bacterial growth. In the addition range of 0-1 mL/L, the higher addition amount, 
      indicates better foam control effect. The maximum foam height could be reduced by
      55% and the foam existence time by 36 h. The reduction of foam was beneficial to 
      biohydrogen production, and the highest cumulative hydrogen yield was increased
      23% at the addition level of 0.125 mL/L.

AB  - Microbes recycling nutrient and detoxifying ecosystems are capable to fulfil the 
      future energy need by producing biohydrogen by due to the coupling of autotrophic
      and heterotrophic microbes. In granules microbes mutualy exchanging nutrients and
      electrons for hydrogen production. The consortial biohydrogen production depend
      upon constituent microbes, their interdependence, competition for resources, and 
      other operating parameters while remediating a waste material in nature or
      bioreactor. The present review deals with development of granular algae-bacteria 
      consortia, hydrogen yield in coculture, important enzymes and possible
      engineering for improved hydrogen production.

AB  - As a clean energy carrier, hydrogen is a promising alternative to fossil fuel so 
      as the global growing energy demand can be met. Currently, producing hydrogen
      from biowastes through fermentation has attracted much attention due to its
      multiple advantages of biowastes management and valuable energy generation.
      Nevertheless, conventional dark fermentation (DF) processes are still hindered by
      the low biohydrogen yields and challenges of biohydrogen purification, which
      limit their commercialization. In recent years, researchers have focused on
      various advanced strategies for enhancing biohydrogen yields, such as screening
      of super hydrogen-producing bacteria, genetic engineering, cell immobilization,
      nanomaterials utilization, bioreactors modification, and combination of different
      processes. This paper critically reviews by discussing the above stated
      technologies employed in DF, respectively, to improve biohydrogen generation and 
      stating challenges and future perspectives on biowaste-based biohydrogen
      production.

AB  - Low hydrogen (H2) yield via dark fermentation often occurs, being mainly due to
      H2 generation pathway shift. In this study, lanthanum-iron oxide nanoparticles
      (LaFeO3 NPs) were prepared to investigate their effects on bioH2 production. The 
      highest H2 yield of 289.8 mL/g glucose was found at 100 mg/L of LaFeO3, being
      47.6% higher than that from the control (196.3 mL/g glucose). The relative
      abundance of Firmicutes increased from 54.2% to 67.5%. The large specific surface
      area of LaFeO3 provided sufficient sites for the colonization of Firmicutes and
      increased the bacterial access to nutrients. Additionally, the La(3+) gradually
      released from LaFeO3 NPs raised microbial transmembrane transport capacity,
      promoting glycolytic efficiency and Fe availability, thereby increasing
      hydrogenase content, and shifting the bioH2 evolution to butyrate pathway for
      more H2. This provides the novelty for biochemical utilization of La and new
      insights into the improved H2 yield amended with LaFeO3.

TI  - Microbial and functional characterization of granulated sludge from full-scale
      UASB thermophilic reactor applied to sugarcane vinasse treatment.
PG  - 1-20
LID - 10.1080/09593330.2022.2052361 [doi]
AB  - Considering the scarcity of data in the literature regarding phylogenetic and
      metabolic composition of different inocula, especially those from thermophilic
      conditions, this research aimed at characterizing the microbial community and
      preferable metabolic pathways of an UASB reactor sludge applied to the
      thermophilic treatment (55 degrees C) of sugarcane vinasse, by means of shotgun
      metagenomics. After its metabolic potential was depicted, it was possible to
      observe several genes encoding enzymes that are of great importance to anaerobic 
      digestion processes with different wastes as substrate, especially regarding the 
      biodegradation of carbohydrates and ligninolytic compounds, glycerolypids,
      volatile fatty acids and alcohols metabolism and biogas (H2 and CH4) production. 
      The genera identified in higher relative abundances for Bacteria domain were
      Sulfirimonas (37.52 +/- 1.8%), possibly related to the sludge endogenic activity 
      due to its strong relation with a peptidoglycan lyase enzymes family, followed by
      Fluviicola (5.01 +/- 1.0%), Defluviitoga (4.36 +/- 0.2%), Coprothermobacter (4.32
      +/- 0.5%), Fervidobacterium (2.93 +/- 0.3%), Marinospirillum (2.75 +/- 0.2%),
      Pseudomonas (2.14 +/- 0.2%) and Flavobacterium (1.78 +/- 0.1%), mostly related
      with carbohydrates fermentations and/or H2 production. For Archaea domain,
      Methanosarcina (0.61 +/- 0.1%), Methanothermobacter (0.38 +/- 0.0%),
      Methanoculleus (0.30 +/- 0.1%), Thermococcus (0.03 +/- 0.0%), Methanolobus (0.02 
      +/- 1.8%), Methanobacterium (0.013 +/- 0.0%), Aciduliprofundum and Pyrococcus
      (0.01 +/- 0.0%) were the most dominant ones, being Methanosarcina the most
      related with methanogenesis. It was concluded that the robust inoculum

AB  - Combating climate change and ensuring energy supply to a rapidly growing global
      population has highlighted the need to replace petroleum fuels with clean, and
      sustainable renewable fuels. Biofuels offer a solution to safeguard energy
      security with reduced ecological footprint and process economics. Over the past
      years, lignocellulosic biomass has become the most preferred raw material for the
      production of biofuels, such as fuel, alcohol, biodiesel, and biohydrogen.
      However, the cost-effective conversion of lignocellulose into biofuels remains an
      unsolved challenge at the industrial scale. Recently, intensive efforts have been
      made in lignocellulose feedstock and microbial engineering to address this
      problem. By improving the biological pathways leading to the polysaccharide,
      lignin, and lipid biosynthesis, limited success has been achieved, and still
      needs to improve sustainable biofuel production. Impressive success is being
      achieved by the retouring metabolic pathways of different microbial hosts.
      Several robust phenotypes, mostly from bacteria and yeast domains, have been
      successfully constructed with improved substrate spectrum, product yield and
      sturdiness against hydrolysate toxins. Cyanobacteria is also being explored for
      metabolic advancement in recent years, however, it also remained underdeveloped
      to generate commercialized biofuels. The bacterium Escherichia coli and yeast
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains are also being engineered to have cell surfaces 
      displaying hydrolytic enzymes, which holds much promise for near-term scale-up
      and biorefinery use. Looking forward, future advances to achieve economically
      feasible production of lignocellulosic-based biofuels with special focus on
      designing more efficient metabolic pathways coupled with screening, and
      engineering of novel enzymes.

TI  - Mathematical modeling of metal recovery from E-waste using a
      dark-fermentation-leaching process.
PG  - 4274
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-08106-2 [doi]
AB  - In this work, an original mathematical model for metals leaching from electronic 
      waste in a dark fermentation process is proposed. The kinetic model consists of a
      system of non-linear ordinary differential equations, accounting for the main
      biological, chemical, and physical processes occurring in the fermentation of
      soluble biodegradable substrates and in the dissolution process of metals. Ad-hoc
      experimental activities were carried out for model calibration purposes, and all 
      experimental data were derived from specific lab-scale tests. The calibration was
      achieved by varying kinetic and stoichiometric parameters to match the simulation
      results to experimental data. Cumulative hydrogen production, glucose, organic
      acids, and leached metal concentrations were obtained from analytical procedures 
      and used for the calibration. The results confirmed the high accuracy of the
      model in describing biohydrogen production, organic acids accumulation, and
      metals leaching during the biological degradation process. Thus, the mathematical
      model represents a useful and reliable tool for the design of strategies for
      valuable metals recovery from waste or mineral materials. Moreover, further
      numerical simulations were carried out to analyze the interactions between the
      fermentation and the leaching processes and to maximize the efficiency of metals 
      recovery due to the fermentation by-products.

TI  - Archaeal and Bacterial Content in a Two-Stage Anaerobic System for Efficient
      Energy Production from Agricultural Wastes.
LID - 1512 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27051512 [doi]
AB  - Anaerobic digestion (AD) is a microbially-driven process enabling energy
      production. Microorganisms are the core of anaerobic digesters and play an
      important role in the succession of hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis, and
      methanogenesis processes. The diversity of participating microbial communities
      can provide new information on digester performance for biomass valorization and 
      biofuel production. In this study anaerobic systems were used, operating under
      mesophilic conditions that realized biodegradation processes of waste wheat straw
      pretreated with NaOH-a renewable source for hydrogen and methane production.
      These processes could be managed and optimized for hydrogen and methane
      separately but combining them in a two-stage system can lead to higher yields and
      a positive energy balance. The aim of the study was to depict a process of
      biohydrogen production from lignocellulosic waste followed by a second one
      leading to the production of biomethane. Archaeal and bacterial consortia in a
      two-stage system operating with wheat straw were identified for the first time
      and the role of the most important representatives was elucidated. The mixed
      cultures were identified by the molecular-biological methods of metagenomics. The
      results showed that biohydrogen generation is most probably due to the presence
      of Proteiniphilum saccharofermentans, which was 28.2% to 45.4% of the microbial
      community in the first and the second bioreactor, respectively. Archaeal
      representatives belonging to Methanobacterium formicicum (0.71% of the
      community), Methanosarcina spelaei (0.03%), Methanothrix soehngenii (0.012%), and
      Methanobacterium beijingense (0.01%) were proven in the methane-generating
      reactor. The correlation between substrate degradation and biogas accumulation
      was calculated, together with the profile of fatty acids as intermediates
      produced during the processes. The hydrogen concentration in the biogas reached
      14.43%, and the Methane concentration was 69%. Calculations of the energy yield
      during the two-stage process showed 1195.89 kWh.t(-1) compared to a 361.62
      kWh.t(-1) cumulative yield of energy carrier for a one-stage process.

TI  - Sustainable Waste Management Strategies for Effective Energy Utilization in Oman:
      A Review.
PG  - 825728
LID - 10.3389/fbioe.2022.825728 [doi]
AB  - Due to the adverse effect of energy production from traditional fossil fuels, the
      move toward renewable and sustainable energy has become imperative. The waste
      disposal sector offers hope toward environmental sustainability and potential to 
      generate strong income for any economy. The region of the Gulf Cooperation
      Council (GCC) member countries in the Middle East generates the highest quantity 
      of municipal waste per capita, compared to other countries globally. In the GCC
      region, waste is usually just dumped at different landfill stations. Effective
      waste management is imperative for environmental protection and sustainable
      development. This article presents a review of the sustainable waste management
      strategies in Oman, in line with the United Nations goal on environmental
      management of waste. The current waste management strategies in Oman were
      discussed, and various waste-to-energy (WTE) technologies were proposed. These
      proposed WTE strategies would help in effective waste management in Oman and also
      in increasing the power grid capability. The salient part of this article is an
      overview of the ability of using landfill leachate as feedstock to produce clean 
      and green hydrogen gas using different photo-fermentation processes. The
      production of hydrogen using single photo-fermentation process using landfill
      leachate alone, with leachate and addition of inoculum such as sewage sludge, and
      with substrates such as sucrose, glucose, and landfill leachate was investigated 
      by utilizing a batch bioreactor and anaerobic conditions at controlled
      temperature, different initial pH, and heat treatment temperature range.
      Furthermore, a prototype model for the optimization of the inoculum size and the 
      substrate was proposed with 2-level factorial design using Design Expert. The
      data gathering for this study was carried out by investigating different regions 
      in Oman having the lowest and highest waste produce, the average annual waste for
      the different governorates, and the total amount of waste for five consecutive
      years (2015-2020), for the various engineered landfills. The cost of managing
      waste in the different governorates of Oman was presented, considering the
      average annual waste produced, in various regions of the country for the duration
      of the study. Furthermore, some challenges and opportunities in carrying out
      effective waste management in Oman were addressed.

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass is projected as a prospective renewable alternative to
      petroleum for the production of fuel and chemicals. Pretreatment is necessary to 
      disrupt the lignocellulosic structure for extraction of cellulose. Biomass after 
      pretreatment is segregated into cellulose rich solid fraction and black liquor
      (lignin and hemicelluloses) as a liquid stream. The plant polysaccharide-based
      industry primarily utilizes the cellulosic fraction as raw material, and carbon
      rich black liquor discarded as waste or burnt for energy recovery. This review
      highlights the recent advancements in the biological and chemical valorization of
      black liquor into fuels and chemicals. The recent research attempted for
      bioconversion of black liquor into Bioplastic, Biohydrogen, Biogas, and chemicals
      has been discussed. In addition, the efforts to replace the conventional energy
      recovery method with the advanced chemical process along with their modifications
      have been reviewed that will decide the sustainability of the lignocellulosic
      biomass-based industry.

AB  - Excess sludge (ES) largely produced in municipal wastewater treatment plants is
      known as a waste biomass and the traditional treatment processes such as landfill
      and incineration are considered as unsustainable due to the negative
      environmental impact. Fermentation process of ES for the biorefinery of
      zero-carbon hydrogen has attracted an increasing interesting and was extensively 
      researched in the last decades. However, the technology is far from commercial
      application due to the insufficient effectivity. In the present study,
      anthraquinone-2-sulfonate (AQS) as electron shuttles was introduced into the
      fermentation process of ES for mediating the composition and activity of
      bacterial community to get an enhanced biohydrogen production. Inoculated with
      the same anaerobic activated sludge of 1.12 gVSS/L, a series of batch anaerobic
      fermentation systems with various dosage of AQS were conducted at the same ES
      load of 2.75 gVSS/L, initial pH 6.5 and 35 degrees C. The results showed that the
      fermentation process was remarkably enhanced by the introduction of 100 mg/L AQS,
      accompanying the lag phase was shortened to 1.35 h from 7.62. The obtained
      biohydrogen yield and the specific biohydrogen production rate were also
      remarkably enhanced to 24.9 mL/gVSS and 0.3 mL/(gVSS.h), respectively. Illumina
      Miseq sequencing showed that Longilinea and Guggenheimella as the dominant genera
      had been enriched from 9.2% to 0-12.0% and 4.7%, respectively, in the presence of
      100 mg/L AQS. Function predicted analysis suggested that the presence of AQS had 
      increased the abundance of genes involved in the transport and metabolism of
      carbohydrate, amino acid and energy production. Further redundancy analysis (RDA)
      revealed that the enhanced hydrogen production was highly positively correlated
      with the enrichment of genera such as Longilinea and Guggenheimella. The research
      work presents a novel potential biorefinery of ES for the effective production of
      zero-carbon hydrogen.

AB  - This research work aimed about the enhanced bio-hydrogen production from marine
      macro algal biomass (Ulva reticulate) through surfactant induced microwave
      disintegration (SIMD). Microwave disintegration (MD) was performed by varying the
      power from 90 to 630 W and time from 0 to 40 min. The maximum chemical oxygen
      demand (COD) solubilisation of 27.9% was achieved for MD at the optimal power
      (40%). A surfactant, ammonium dodecyl sulphate (ADS) is introduced in optimal
      power of MD which enhanced the solubilisation to 34.2% at 0.0035 g ADS/g TS
      dosage. The combined SIMD pretreatment significantly reduce the treatment time
      and increases the COD solubilisation when compared to MD. Maximum hydrogen yield 
      of 54.9 mL H2 /g COD was observed for SIMD than other samples. In energy
      analysis, it was identified that SIMD was energy efficient process compared to
      others since SIMD achieved energy ratio of 1.04 which is higher than MD (0.38).

AB  - The torrefaction pretreatment technology with different temperature varying from 
      160 to 240 was utilized to enhance the enzymatic saccharification and hydrogen
      production potential of corn stover. The composition characteristics, Crystal
      Intensity (CrI), reducing sugars yield and hydrogen production of the pretreated 
      corn stover were detected to explore the torrefaction pretreatment effectiveness.
      Results revealed that the reducing sugar yield and hydrogen production from corn 
      stover were improved significantly through torrefaction pretreatment, both the
      maximum reducing sugar yield of 427.86 +/- 19 mg/g Total solid(TS) and hydrogen
      yield of 123.72 mL/g TS were obtained at 200 , increased by 46.41% and 70.79%,
      respectively. The kinetic parameters from Gompertz model showed torrefaction
      pretreatment could shorten the lag phase time of enzymatic saccharification and
      hydrogen production. The reducing sugar data can be fitted well by fractal-like
      kinetic model and Gompertz model.

AB  - In the past decades, considerable attention has been directed toward anaerobic
      digestion (AD), which is an effective biological process for converting diverse
      organic wastes into biogas, volatile fatty acids (VFAs), biohydrogen, etc. The
      microbial bioprocessing takes part during AD is of substantial significance, and 
      one of the crucial approaches for the deep and adequate understanding and
      manipulating it toward different products is process microbiology. Due to highly 
      complexity of AD microbiome, it is critically important to study the involved
      microorganisms in AD. In recent years, in addition to traditional methods, novel 
      molecular techniques and meta-omics approaches have been developed which provide 
      accurate details about microbial communities involved AD. Better understanding of
      process microbiomes could guide us in identifying and controlling various factors
      in both improving the AD process and diverting metabolic pathway toward
      production of selective bio-products. This review covers various platforms of AD 
      process that results in different final products from microbiological point of
      view. The review also highlights distinctive interactions occurring among
      microbial communities. Furthermore, assessment of these communities existing in
      the anaerobic digesters is discussed to provide more insights into their
      structure, dynamics, and metabolic pathways. Moreover, the important factors
      affecting microbial communities in each platform of AD are highlighted. Finally, 
      the review provides some recent applications of AD for the production of novel
      bio-products and deals with challenges and future perspectives of AD.

      gold-shell nanoparticles (NPs) over a range of acetate concentrations (5-40 mM)
      and light intensities (11-160 W/m(2)). The kinetic data were modeled using
      modified Monod equations containing light intensity effects. The yields of H2 and
      CO2 produced per acetate were determined as 2.31 mol-H2/mol-Ac and 0.83
      mol-CO2/mol-Ac and increased to 4.38 mmol-H2/mmol-Ma and 2.62 mmol-CO2/mmol-Ma
      when malate was used. Maximum increases in H2 and CO2 productions by 115% and
      113% were observed by adding NPs without affecting the bacterial growth rates
      (6.1-8.2 mg-DCM/L/hour) while the highest hydrogen production rate was determined
      as 0.81 mmol/L/hour. Model simulations showed that the energy conversion
      efficiency increased with NPs concentration but decreased with the intensity.
      Complete hydrogenation application was demonstrated with toxic 2-chlorobiphenyl
      using Pd catalysts.

AB  - There has been increasing attention in recent years on the use of
      photobioreactors for various biotechnological applications, especially for the
      cultivation of microalgae. Photobioreactors-based production of photosynthetic
      microorganisms furnish several advantages as minimising toxicity and providing
      improved conditions. However, the designing and scaling-up of photobioreactors
      (PBRs) remain a challenge. Due to huge capital investment and operating cost,
      there is a deficiency of suitable PBRs for development of photosynthetic
      microorganisms on large-scale. It is, therefore, highly desirable to understand
      the current state-of-the-art PBRs, their advantages and limitations so as to
      classify different PBRs as per their most suited applications. This review
      provides a holistic overview of the discreet features of diverse PBR designs and 
      their purpose in microalgae growth and biohydrogen production and also summarizes
      the recent development in use of hybrid PBRs to increase their working efficiency
      and overall economics of their operation for the production of value-added
      products.

AB  - Deep eutectic solvent (DES), a new green solvent, was used to pretreat corncob to
      enhance biohydrogen production. As a result of the pretreatment, lignin was
      effectively removed, and the maximum delignification efficiency of 83.12% was
      achieved. Moreover, the contents of cellulose in the pretreated corncob
      significantly increased. DES pretreatment effect improved with increasing
      liquid-solid ratio. The pretreated corncob's enzymatic saccharification activity 
      and hydrogen production were promoted due to the lower content of lignin. The
      best result was observed at a ratio of 25:1 (DES:corncob, g/g), in which the
      reducing sugar concentration (53.91 g/L) and the hydrogen yield (151 mL/g) was
      6.8 and 3.1 times than that of untreated corncob, respectively. In addition, the 
      lag time of hydrogen production was obviously shortened to 16.53 h due to the
      utilization of abundant available fermentable sugars, which accelerated hydrogen 
      production.

AB  - The effects of alkalization pretreatment and enzymolysis on biohydrogen
      production with Chlorella vulgaris microalgae biomass by photosynthesis were
      studied, the alkalization pretreatment enzymolysis was to alkalize biomass raw
      materials before enzymolysis, the biohydrogen production kinetics equation of
      microalgae biomass was put forward by comparing the biohydrogen process of
      enzymatic hydrolysis with that of alkaline pretreatment enzymatic hydrolysis. The
      experimental results show: the optimum initial substrate concentration for
      biohydrogen production by enzymatic hydrolysis and alkaline pretreatment was 24
      g/L, the maximum biohydrogen was 132.1 mL and 294.5 mL, the maximum specific
      biohydrogen production was 22.0 mL/g and 49.1 mL/g, and the maximum biohydrogen
      content was 43.9% and 56.8%. The effect of biohydrogen production by enzymatic
      hydrolysis after alkaline pretreatment of microalgae biomass is obviously better 
      than that by direct enzymatic hydrolysis, which provides scientific reference and
      development of high efficiency and low cost biohydrogen production technology by 
      photosynthesis of microalgae biomass.

AB  - Pretreatment of biomass helps to enhance reducing sugar yield from biomass during
      enzyme hydrolysis tests. Ultrafine grinding was applied to pretreat corncob. The 
      effect of affecting factors including milling time, initial particle size and
      ball to power weight on the reducing sugar yield from corncob was investigated
      firstly. And then, an GM(1,N) model was constructed to model the ultrafine
      grinding pretreatment system predicting the reducing sugar yield from corncob
      based on experimental data, the results demonstrate GM(1,N) could predict the
      reducing sugar yield accurately and effectively without depending on the number
      of samples. The initial particle size was the most critical influential factor
      affecting reducing sugar yield according to the driving coefficient. The
      cumulative hydrogen yield was significantly affected by ultrafine grinding
      pretreatment, the hydrogen yield of pretreated corncob was 153.60 +/- 5.8 mL/g
      total solids, which was higher than that of untreated corncob (113.20 +/- 3.2
      mL/g total solids).

AB  - Genome sequencing was used to identify key genes for the generation of hydrogen
      gas through cotton stalk hydrolysate fermentation by Klebsiella sp. WL1316.
      Genome annotation indicated that the genome size was 5.2 Mb with GC content
      57.6%. Xylose was metabolized in the pentose phosphate pathway via the conversion
      of xylose to xylulose in Klebsiella sp. WL1316. This strain contained diverse
      formate-hydrogen lyases and hydrogenases with gene numbers higher than closely
      related species. A metabolic network involving glucose, xylose utilisation, and
      fermentative hydrogen production was reconstructed. Metabolic analysis of key
      node metabolites showed that glucose and xylose metabolism influenced biomass
      synthesis and biohydrogen production. Formic acid accumulated during fermentation
      at 24-48 h but decreased sharply after 48 h, illustrating the splitting of formic
      acid to hydrogen gas during early-to-mid fermentation. The Kreb's cycle was the
      main competitive metabolic branch of biohydrogen synthesis at 24 h of
      fermentation. Lactic and acetic acid fermentation and late ethanol accumulation
      competed the carbon skeleton of biohydrogen synthesis after 72 h of fermentation,
      indicating that these competitive pathways are regulated in middle-to-late
      fermentation (48-96 h). This study is the first to elucidate the metabolic
      mechanisms of mixed sugar utilisation and biohydrogen synthesis based on genomic 
      information.

AB  - This study focused on the techno-economic analysis of integrated
      polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) and biofuels such as biohydrogen, bioethanol, and
      2,3-butanediol production from food waste (FW). Based on previous literature
      studies, the integrated process was developed. The process plan produced 2.01 MT 
      of PHAs, 0.29 MT of biohydrogen, 4.79 MT of bioethanol, and 6.79 MT of
      2,3-butanediol per day, from 50 MT of FW. The process plan has a positive net
      present value of 4.47 M$, a 13.68% return on investment, a payback period of 7.31
      yr, and an internal rate of return of 11.95%. Sensitivity analysis was used to
      examine the economic feasibility. The actual minimum selling price (MSP) of PHAs 
      was 4.83 $/kg, and the lowest achievable MSP with 30% solid loading is 2.41 $/kg.
      The solid loading in the hydrolysis stage and the price of byproducts have a
      major impact on the economic factors and MSP of PHAs.

AB  - In this study, Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum MJ2 and biochar were
      used to enhance thermophilic hydrogen production from sugarcane bagasse. MJ2
      bioaugmentation notably increased the hydrogen production by 95.31%, which was
      further significantly improved by 158.10% by adding biochar. The addition of
      biochar promoted the degradation of substrate, improved the activities of
      hydrogenase and electron transfer system, and stimulated microbial growth and
      metabolism. Microbial community analysis showed that the relative abundance of
      Thermoanaerobacterium was significantly increased by bioaugmentation and further 
      enriched by biochar. PICRUSt analysis showed that MJ2 combined with biochar
      promoted metabolic pathways related to substrate degradation and microbial
      metabolism. This study provides a novel enhancement method for hydrogen
      production of the cellulolytic microbial consortium by exogenous
      hydrogen-producing microorganism combined with biochar and deepens the
      understanding of its functional mechanism.

AB  - The feasibility of adding sulfidated nanoscale zero-valent iron (S-nZVI) into
      anaerobic systems to improve anaerobic digestion of food waste (FW) under ammonia
      stress was evaluated in this study. The addition of S-nZVI improved the methane
      production compared to nanoscale zero-valent iron (nZVI), indicating that
      sulfidation significantly reinforced the enhancement effect of nZVI in
      consolidating the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. The promoted methanogenic
      performance was associated with chemical reaction and variances of microbial
      community induced by S-nZVI. With the characteristics of generation of Fe(2+) and
      slow-release of H2, S-nZVI made the anaerobic system respond positively in
      facilitating extracellular polymeric substances secretion and optimizing the
      microbial community structure. Moreover, microbial community analysis showed that
      S-nZVI addition enriched the species related to biohydrogen production (e.g.,
      Prevotella) and ammonia-tolerant hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis (e.g.,
      Methanoculleus), possibly enhancing the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis pathway
      to accelerate methane production. Therefore, adding S-nZVI into the anaerobic
      systems might propose a feasible engineering strategy to improve the methanogenic
      performance of the anaerobic digestion of FW upon ammonia stress.

AB  - Substances harmful to photo-fermentative biological hydrogen production (PFHP)
      were produced during cellulose hydrolysis. This study aimed to evaluate the
      effect of by-products (5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) and furfural) released
      from lignocellulose during enzymatic hydrolysis process on PFHP. The exist of
      5-HMF inhibited the hydrogen production. However, 0.2 g/L furfural improved the
      hydrogen production by 19 % compared to no addition (511.6 mL) with a maximum
      concentration of nitrogenase (109.96 IU/L) at 96 h. Furthermore, a 18.7 %
      enhancement of hydrogen production was also observed when 0.2 g/L 5-HMF and
      furfural were mixed at a ratio of 1:1, while decrement of hydrogen production at 
      higher addition was observed as well. Through the scatter matrix analysis, it was
      concluded that 5-HMF and furfural additives had significant effects on PFHP. This
      study gave an insight into effect of lignocellulosic by-products on biohydrogen
      production.

AB  - As the population is increasing at a rapid pace, we now find ourselves in a
      position where cities are using a growing amount of renewable energy. Renewable
      energy is the key to help avert climate change and this approach must be
      sustainable. At the juncture, this review analyses the potential of wind, biomass
      and hybrid systems in the field of renewable energy production. Initially, the
      manuscript addressed the feedstocks and their potential for different biofuels
      such as bioethanol, biodiesel, biomethane, biohydrogen and biohythane from the
      biomass. With a focus on long-term energy sustainability, this article
      investigates performance analysis and sustainability of wind energy systems and
      biomass-based hybrid configurations with wind and its various design factors,
      problems, and gaps were examined. According to the findings, biomass-based hybrid
      energy systems can provide a cost-effective and environmentally beneficial
      alternative, particularly for off-grid rural electrification. The study provides 
      designers, academicians, and policymakers with vital information on the most
      recent design restrictions and other factors related to biomass-wind hybrid
      energy systems.

AB  - This study aimed to establish the optimal operational conditions for hydrogen
      production using vermicomposting-tea and sugarcane molasses as substrate. The
      experiments were carried out by triplicate in 110 ml serological bottles, a
      Box-Behnken design of experiments was performed in anaerobic dark conditions. The
      maximal hydrogen production (HP), hydrogen production rate (HPR), and hydrogen
      yield (HY) attained were 1021.0 mlL(-1), 5.32 mlL(-1)h(-1), and 60.3
      mlLH2(-1)/gTCC, respectively. The statistical model showed that the optimal
      operational conditions for pH, molasses concentration, and temperature were 6.5; 
      30 % (v/v) and 25 degrees C. The bioreactor run showed 17.202 L of hydrogen, 0.58
      Lh(-1), and 77.2 mlH2gTCC(-1) For HP, HPR, and HY. Chemometric analysis for the
      volatile fatty acids obtained at the fermentation showed that only two principal 
      components are required to explain 90 % of the variance. The representative
      pathways for hydrogen production were acetic and butyric acids. This study
      established the operational conditions for the upstream processing amenable to
      pilot and industrial-scale operations. Our results add value to molasses within
      the circular economy for hydrogen production using a novel consortium from
      vermicompost.

AB  - The use of renewable energy sources as a substitute for nonrenewable fossil fuels
      is urgently required. Algae biorefinery platform provides an excellent alternate 
      to overcome future energy problems. However, to let this viable biomass be
      competent with existing feedstocks, it is necessary to exploit genetic
      manipulation and improvement in upstream and downstream platforms for optimal
      bio-product recovery. Furthermore, the techno-economic strategies further
      maximize metabolites production for biofuel, biohydrogen, and other industrial
      applications. The experimental methodologies in algal photobioreactor promote
      high biomass production, enriched in lipid and starch content in limited
      environmental conditions. This review presents an optimization framework
      combining genetic manipulation methods to simulate microalgal growth dynamics,
      understand the complexity of algal biorefinery to scale up, and identify green
      strategies for techno-economic feasibility of algae for biomass conversion.
      Overall, the algal biorefinery opens up new possibilities for the valorization of
      algae biomass and the synthesis of various novel products.

AB  - This work employed a unique kind of vinicultural biomass (grape residues) to
      generate fermentative hydrogen. This form of biomass serves two purposes
      (contains substrate and inoculum). Four mathematical model methods were
      established; these models were used to represent the fluctuation of hydrogen
      generation and other fermentation products (organic acids, alcohols), the
      consumption of substrates included in biomass, and bacterial growth. One of these
      models was verified using experimental data and used to represent all of the
      metabolic pathways of bacteria contained in the medium and the interaction
      between products and substrates. The optimal biomass load, 60 g COD (Chemical
      Oxygen Demand)/L with a concentration of 0.22 mol of hexose and 0.0444 mol of
      tartrate offers the best hydrogen yield.

AB  - The effect of citrate buffer on biohydrogen production using photosynthetic
      bacteria was studied. The study was performed in two steps. First, specific
      concentrations of citrate and sodium citrate as buffers were mixed into batch
      cultures, and the effects of these buffers on fermentation broth characteristics 
      and biohydrogen production were analyzed. The maximum overall biohydrogen yield
      of 411.4 mL, which was 42% higher to the control group, was obtained with 0.05
      mol/L citrate buffer. Then, the effect of 0.05 mol/L citrate buffer on
      biohydrogen yield at different pH values (5.5-7.5) were explored. The maximum
      biohydrogen yield of 429.82 mL was obtained at pH 6, and the final pH values were
      effectively controlled. The findings indicated that citrate buffer seriously
      affected the pH of the reaction liquid. The results provide technical support to 
      stabilize the pH of photo-fermentation broth and improve biohydrogen production
      performance.

TI  - An Overview of Recent Advancements in Microbial Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA)
      Production from Dark Fermentation Acidogenic Effluents: A Path to an Integrated
      Bio-Refinery.
LID - 4297 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/polym13244297 [doi]
AB  - Global energy consumption has been increasing in tandem with economic growth
      motivating researchers to focus on renewable energy sources. Dark fermentative
      hydrogen synthesis utilizing various biomass resources is a promising, less
      costly, and less energy-intensive bioprocess relative to other biohydrogen
      production routes. The generated acidogenic dark fermentative effluent [e.g.,
      volatile fatty acids (VFAs)] has potential as a reliable and sustainable carbon
      substrate for polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthesis. PHA, an important alternative
      to petrochemical based polymers has attracted interest recently, owing to its
      biodegradability and biocompatibility. This review illustrates methods for the
      conversion of acidogenic effluents (VFAs), such as acetate, butyrate, propionate,
      lactate, valerate, and mixtures of VFAs, into the value-added compound PHA. In
      addition, the review provides a comprehensive update on research progress of VFAs
      to PHA conversion and related enhancement techniques including optimization of
      operational parameters, fermentation strategies, and genetic engineering
      approaches. Finally, potential bottlenecks and future directions for the
      conversion of VFAs to PHA are outlined. This review offers insights to
      researchers on an integrated biorefinery route for sustainable and cost-effective
      bioplastics production.

AB  - Hydrogen has become a research highlight by virtue of its clean energy production
      technology and high energy content. The technology of biohydrogen production from
      biological waste via fermentation has lower costs, provides environment-friendly 
      methods regarding energy balance, and creates a pathway for sustainable
      utilization of massive agricultural waste. However, biohydrogen production is
      generally limited by lower productivity. Many studies have been conducted aimed
      at improving biohydrogen production efficiency. Hence, this review is intended to
      describe improving routes for biohydrogen production from agricultural waste and 
      highlights recent advances in these approaches. In addition, the critical factors
      affecting biohydrogen production, including the pretreatment method, substrate
      resource, fermentation conditions, and bioreactor design, were also
      comprehensively discussed along with challenges and future prospects.

AB  - This study reviews the recent advances and innovations in the application of
      additives to improve biomethane and biohydrogen production. Biochar,
      nanostructured materials, novel biopolymers, zeolites, and clays are described in
      terms of chemical composition, properties and impact on anaerobic digestion, dark
      fermentation, and photofermentation. These additives can have both a simple
      physical effect of microbial adhesion and growth, and a more complex biochemical 
      impact on the regulation of key parameters for CH4 and H2 production: in this
      study, these effects in different experimental conditions are reviewed and
      described. The considered parameters include pH, volatile fatty acids (VFA), C:N 
      ratio, and NH3; additionally, the global impact on the total production yield of 
      biogas and bioH2 is reviewed. A special focus is given to NH3, due to its strong 
      inhibition effect towards methanogens, and its contribution to digestate quality,
      leaching, and emissions into the atmosphere.

TI  - Improvement of Hydrogen Production during Anaerobic Fermentation of Food Waste
      Leachate by Enriched Bacterial Culture Using Biochar as an Additive.
LID - 2438 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms9122438 [doi]
AB  - It has become urgent to develop cost-effective and clean technologies for the
      rapid and efficient treatment of food waste leachate, caused by the rapid
      accumulation of food waste volume. Moreover, to face the energy crisis, and to
      avoid dependence on non-renewable energy sources, the investigation of new
      sustainable and renewable energy sources from organic waste to energy conversion 
      is an attractive option. Green energy biohydrogen production from food waste
      leachate, using a microbial pathway, is one of the most efficient technologies,
      due to its eco-friendly nature and high energy yield. Therefore, the present
      study aimed to evaluate the ability of an enriched bacterial mixture, isolated
      from forest soil, to enhance hydrogen production from food waste leachate using
      biochar. A lab-scale analysis was conducted at 35 degrees C and at different pH
      values (4, no adjustment, 6, 6.5, 7, and 7.5) over a period of 15 days. The
      sample with the enriched bacterial mixture supplemented with an optimum of 10 g/L
      of biochar showed the highest performance, with a maximum hydrogen yield of 1620 
      mL/day on day three. The total solid and volatile solid removal rates were 78.5% 
      and 75% after 15 days, respectively. Acetic and butyrate acids were the dominant 
      volatile fatty acids produced during the process, as favorable metabolic pathways
      for accelerating hydrogen production.

AB  - Microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) system is an environmentally friendly method
      for clean biohydrogen production from a wide range of biowastes owing to low
      greenhouse gas emissions. This approach has relatively higher yields and lower
      energy costs for biohydrogen production compared to conventional biological
      technologies and direct water electrolysis, respectively. However, biohydrogen
      production efficiency and operating costs of MEC still need further optimization 
      to realize its large-scale application.This paper provides a unique review of
      impact factors influencing biohydrogen production in MECs, such as microorganisms
      and electrodes. Novel strategies, including inhibition of methanogens,
      development of novel cathode catalyst, advanced reactor design and integrated
      systems, to enhance low-cost biohydrogen production, are discussed based on
      recent publications in terms of their opportunities, bottlenecks and future
      directions. In addition, the current challenges, and effective future
      perspectives towards the practical application of MECs are described in this
      review.

AB  - Oxidative stress induced by hyperglycemia or chronic inflammation can limit
      diabetic wound healing, resulting in diabetic foot ulcers. Hydrogen has the
      potential to act as an antioxidant and scavenge reactive oxygen species, thereby 
      attenuating inflammation in these chronic wounds. However, most of the reported
      H2 delivery systems for wound healing, including hydrogen gas, hydrogen-rich
      water, and hydrogen-rich saline, are very short-lived for the low solubility of
      hydrogen gas. Here, we introduce a hydrogen-producing hydrogel made of living
      Chlorella and bacteria within a cell-impermeable casing that can continuously
      produce hydrogen for 60 h. This microbe-hydrogel system can selectively reduce
      highly toxic *OH and ONOO(-) species and reduce inflammation. Additional
      experiments indicated that the microbe-hydrogel dressing could promote cell
      proliferation and diabetic wound healing by almost 50% at day 3. The symbiotic
      algae-bacteria hydrogel has excellent biocompatibility and reactive oxygen
      species scavenging features, indicating it has great promise for clinical use.

AB  - Modern society envisions hydrogen (H2) fuel to drive the transportation,
      industrial, and domestic sectors. Here, we explore use of graphene oxide
      nanoparticles (GO NPs) for greatly enhancing bio-H2 production by a consortium
      based on Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum spp. Thermophilic batch
      bioreactors were set up at 60 (O)C and initial pH of 8.5 to assess the effects of
      GO NPs supplements on biohydrogen production. Under optimal GO NPs loading of 10 
      mg/L, the supplemented system yielded approximately 300% higher H2 yield (6.78
      mol H2/mol sucrose) than control. Such an optimized system offered 73% H2 purity 
      and 85% conversion efficiency by promoted the desirable acetate fermentation
      pathway. Miseq Illumina sequencing tests revealed that the optimal levels of GO
      NPs did not alter the microbial composition of consortium.

AB  - The processing of sugar beet in the sugar production industry releases huge
      amounts of sugar beet pulp as waste which can be considered a valuable by-product
      as a source of cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin. Valorization of sugar beet
      pulp into value added products occurs through acid hydrolysis, hydrothermal
      techniques, and enzymatic hydrolysis. Biochemical conversion of beet pulp into
      simple fermentable sugars for producing value added products occurs through
      enzymatic hydrolysis is a cost effective and eco-friendly process. While beet
      pulp has predominantly been used as a fodder for livestock, recent developments
      in its biotechnological valorization have unlocked its value as a feedstock in
      the production of biofuels, biohydrogen, biodegradable plastics, and platform
      chemicals such as lactic acid, citric acid, alcohols, microbial enzymes, single
      cell proteins, and pectic oligosaccharides. This review brings forward recent
      biotechnological developments made in the valorization of sugar beet pulp into
      valuable products.

AB  - Microbial fuel cell (MFC) is one of the promising alternative energy systems
      where the catalytic conversion of chemical energy into electrical energy takes
      places with the help of microorganisms. The basic configuration of MFC consists
      of three major components such as electrodes (anode and cathode), catalyst
      (microorganism) and proton transport/exchange membrane (PEM). MFC classified into
      four types based on the substrate utilized for the catalytic energy conversion
      process such as Liquid-phase MFC, Solid-phase MFC, Plant-MFC and Algae-MFC. The
      core performance of MFC is organic substrate oxidation and electron transfer.
      Microorganisms and electrodes are the key factors that decide the efficiency of
      MFC system for electricity generation. Microorganism catalysis degradation of
      organic matters and assist the electron transfer to anode surface, the
      conductivity of anode material decides the rate of electron transport to cathode 
      through external circuit where electrons are reduced with hydrogen and form water
      with oxygen. Not limited to electricity generation, MFC also has diverse
      applications in different sectors including wastewater treatment, biofuel
      (biohydrogen) production and used as biosensor for detection of biological oxygen
      demand (BOD) of wastewater and different contaminants concentration in water.
      This review explains different types of MFC systems and their core performance
      towards energy conversion and waste management. Also provides an insight on
      different factors that significantly affect the MFC performance and different
      aspects of application of MFC systems in various sectors. The challenges of MFC
      system design, operations and implementation in pilot scale level and the
      direction for future research are also described in the present review.

AB  - The kinetic properties of the hydrogen yield of photosynthetic bacteria were
      investigated using Han-Levenspiel and modified Gompertz models to determine the
      effects of different zinc salts on the growth and hydrogen production of the
      photosynthetic bacterium HAU-M1. Inorganic zinc salts (zinc standard solution and
      zinc sulfate) inhibited bacterial growth by 1-4-fold higher than organic zinc
      salts (zinc lactate and zinc gluconate). Among these four zinc salts, 5 mg/L zinc
      lactate displayed the weakest inhibition performance. This compound increased
      cumulative hydrogen production by approximately 57.81% (80.44 mL/g) and maximum
      hydrogen production rate by 58.27% (3.43 mL/[g.h]). The Han-Levenspiel model with
      parameters m > n > 0 indicated that the addition of zinc salts influenced the
      hydrogen production process of the bacterium in a noncompetitive manner. Compared
      with the inorganic zinc, the organic zinc salts were more suitable as exogenous
      zinc supplements to promote bacterial growth and its hydrogen production.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the enhancement of iron ion on growth, metabolic 
      pathway, and biohydrogen production performance of biohydrogen producing bacteria
      HAU-M1. Different concentrations of Fe(2+) and Fe(3+) were respectively added
      into fermentation broth of photo-fermentation biohydrogen production (PFHP) from 
      corn stalk. Regular sampling test was used to measure the characteristics of
      fermentation broth and gas, metabolic pathway, energy conversion efficiency, and 
      kinetic of PFHP. The analysis of experimental data showed that the maximum
      hydrogen yield of 70.25 mL/g was observed at 2500 mumol/L Fe(2+) addition, with
      an energy conversion efficiency of 5.21%, which was 19.98% higher over
      no-addition. However, the maximum hydrogen content of 51.41% and the maximum
      hydrogen production rate of 17.82 mL/h were observed at 2000 mumol/L Fe(2+)
      addition. The experimental results revealed that iron ion played a key role in
      PFHP, which provided a technical support for improving the performance of PFHP.

AB  - Biohydrogen production from marine macroalgal biomass by advanced pre-treatment
      strategies is considered a clean energy technology. The present study focuses on 
      investigating the effects of sonication pre-treatment (SP) and saponin coupled
      sonic pre-treatment (SSP) on Ulva fasciata for enhancing the production of
      biohydrogen. The SP and SSP were optimized to improve the hydrolysis process
      during digestion. The optimized time and sonication power were found respectively
      as 30 min and 200 W. A high concentration of biopolymer release was noticed in
      SSP than SP at optimized conditions. The surfactant dosage in SSP was optimized
      at 0.0036 g/g TS. The effect of SSP process was assessed by estimation of COD
      (Chemical Oxygen Demand) and SCOD (Soluble Chemical Oxygen Demand) release. The
      study revealed that, at a specific energy of 36,000 KJ/Kg TS, the SCOD release
      was higher in SSP (1900 mg/L) than SP (1050 mg/L). The SSP process could improve 
      the COD solubilization to 15 % more than the SP. Carbohydrate and protein release
      are also more in SSP than SP. The use of biosurfactants significantly reduced the
      energy utilization in the hydrolysis process. The SSP pre-treated Ulva fasciata
      biomass has yielded a higher biohydrogen of 91.7 mL/g COD which is higher
      compared to SP (40.5 mL/g COD) and Control (9 mL/g COD).

AB  - The effects of different pretreatment methods, including hydrothermal, acid,
      alkali, acid-heat and alkali-heat on lignin removal, reducing sugar (RS) yield
      and photo-fermentative biohydrogen production (PFHP) capability of corn stover
      (CS) were studied. NaOH-heat pretreatment was the most effective for lignin
      removal from CS, and the lignin removal rate reached 77%. All the studied
      pretreatment methods improved the total RS yield of CS, and the highest total RS 
      yield (46.1 g/100 g raw material (RM)) was obtained from 2% NaOH-heat pretreated 
      CS. 2% NaOH pretreatment realized the best PFHP of CS, which increased the
      hydrogen yield (HY), maximal hydrogen production rate (HPR) and highest hydrogen 
      content (HC) by 31.9%, 50.9% and 20.1% respectively, and shortened hydrogen
      production lag time (HPLT) by 58.8% over that of untreated CS. However, NaOH-heat
      and 4% NaOH pretreatment weakened the PFHP capability of CS.

AB  - The single bioprocess approach has certain limitations in terms of process
      efficiency, product synthesis, and effective resource utilization. Integrated or 
      combined bioprocessing maximizes resource recovery and creates a novel platform
      to establish sustainable biorefineries. Anaerobic fermentation (AF) is a
      well-established process for the transformation of organic waste into biogas;
      conversely, biogas CO2 separation is a challenging and expensive process.
      Biological fixation of CO2 for succinic acid (SA) mitigates CO2 separation issues
      and produces commercially important renewable chemicals. Additionally, utilizing 
      digestate rich in volatile fatty acid (VFA) to produce medium-chain fatty acids
      (MCFAs) creates a novel integrated platform by utilizing residual organic
      metabolites. The present review encapsulates the advantages and limitations of AF
      along with biogas CO2 fixation for SA and digestate rich in VFA utilization for
      MCFA in a closed-loop approach. Biomethane and biohydrogen processes CO2
      utilization for SA production is cohesively deliberated along with the role of
      biohydrogen as an alternative reducing agent to augment SA yields. Similarly,
      MCFA production using VFA as a substrate and functional role of electron donors
      namely ethanol, lactate, and hydrogen are comprehensively discussed. A road map
      to establish the fermentative biorefinery approach in the framework of AF
      integrated sustainable bioprocess development is deliberated along with
      limitations and factors influencing for techno-economic analysis. The discussed
      integrated approach significantly contributes to promote the circular bioeconomy 
      by establishing carbon-neutral processes in accord with sustainable development
      goals.

AB  - Rapid urbanization has increased the demand for food, feed, and chemicals that
      have in turn augmented the use of fossil-based resources and generation of
      organic waste. Owning to the characteristics like high abundance, renewability,
      and ease of accessibility, valorization of organic wastes serves as a potential
      solution for waste management issues. Several industrial wastes, due to their
      organic and nutrient-rich composition, have been utilized as a resource for the
      production of value-added products such as biofuels, biopesticides, biohydrogen, 
      enzymes, and bioplastics via microbial fermentation processes. The process
      consists of pre-treatment of the waste biomass, production of value-added product
      in reactors and downstream processing for product's recovery. The integration of 
      new comprehensive technologies for organic waste utilization will also stimulate 
      the transition towards a circular economy. Therefore, the feasibility and
      sustainability of the production of various value-added products from biowastes
      and byproduct streams will be discussed in the present review.

AB  - Paulownia biomass is rich in carbohydrates, making which a potential feedstock
      for biohydrogen production. In the study, different parts and varieties of
      Paulownia were chose as substrates to evaluate hydrogen production potential of
      paulownia lignocellulose via biohydrogen production by photo fermentation (BHPPF)
      and energy conversion efficiency (ECE). Results showed the highest cumulative
      hydrogen yield (CHY) of 67.11 mL/g total solids (TS) and ECE of 4.74% were
      obtained from leaves of Paulownia, which were 121.06% and 115.45% higher than
      those of the branches. Moreover, Paulownia jianshiensis leaves were found to be
      the best variety for BHPPF, with the maximum CHY of 98.83 mL/g TS and ECE of
      7.18%. Using Paulownia waste as the substrate to produce hydrogen helps broaden
      the range of raw materials for BHPPF and improve the economic utilization of
      forestry waste.

AB  - Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are of great interest due to their capability to
      directly convert organic compounds to electric energy. In particular, MFCs
      technology showed great potential to directly harness the energy from xylose in
      the form of bioelectricity and biohydrogen simultaneously. Herein, we report a
      yeast strain of Cystobasidium slooffiae JSUX1 enabled the reduction and assembly 
      of graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets into three-dimensional reduced GO (3D rGO)
      hydrogels on the surface of carbon felt (CF) anode. The autonomously
      self-modified 3D rGO hydrogel anode entitled the yeast-based MFCs with two times 
      enhancement on bioelectricity and biohydrogen production from xylose. Further
      analysis demonstrated that the 3D rGO hydrogel attracted more yeast cells and
      reduced the interfacial charge transfer resistance, which was the underlying
      mechanism for the improvement of MFCs performance. This work offers a new
      strategy to reinforce the performance of yeast-based MFCs and provides a new
      opportunity to efficiently harvest energy from xylose.

TI  - Novel strategy in biohydrogen energy production from COVID - 19 plastic waste: A 
      critical review.
LID - 10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.08.236 [doi]
AB  - Usage of plastics in the form of personal protective equipment, medical devices, 
      and common packages has increased alarmingly during these pandemic times. Though 
      they have served as an excellent protection source in minimizing the coronavirus 
      disease (COVID-19) spreading, they have still emerged as major environmental
      pollutants nowadays. These non-degradable COVID-19 plastic wastes (CPW) were
      treated through incineration and landfilling process, which may lead to either
      the release of harmful gases or contaminating the surrounding environment.
      Further, they can cause numerous health hazards to the human and animal
      populations. These plastic wastes can be efficiently managed through
      thermochemical processes like pyrolysis or gasification, which assist in
      degrading the plastic waste and also effectively convert them into useful
      energy-yielding products. The pyrolysis process promotes the formation of liquid 
      fuels and chemicals, whereas gasification leads to syngas and hydrogen fuel
      production. These energy-yielding products can help to compensate for the fossil 
      fuels depletion in the near future. There are many insights explained in terms of
      the types of reactors and influential factors that can be adopted for the
      pyrolysis and gasification process, to produce high efficient energy products
      from the wastes. In addition, advanced technologies including co-gasification and
      two-stage gasification were also reviewed.

AB  - Hydrogen as a clean energy that is conducive to energy and environmental
      sustainability, playing a significant role in the alleviation of global climate
      change and energy crisis. Biohydrogen generation from microalgae has been
      reported as a highly attractive approach that can produce a benign clean energy
      carrier to achieve carbon neutrality and bioenergy sustainability. Thus, this
      review explored the mechanism of biohydrogen production from microalgae
      containing direct biophotolysis, indirect biophotolysis, photo fermentation, and 
      dark fermentation. In general, dark fermentation of microalgae for biohydrogen
      production is relatively better than photo fermentation, biophotolysis, and
      microbial electrolysis, because it is able to consecutively generate hydrogen and
      is not reliant on energy supplied by natural sunlight. Besides, this review
      summarized potential algal strains for hydrogen production focusing on green
      microalgae and cyanobacteria. Moreover, a thorough review process was conducted
      to present hydrogen-producing enzymes targeting biosynthesis and localization of 
      enzymes in microalgae. Notably, the most powerful hydrogen-producing enzymes are 
      [Fe-Fe]-hydrogenases, which have an activity nearly 10-100 times better than
      [Ni-Fe]-hydrogenases and 1000 times better than nitrogenases. In addition, this
      work highlighted the major factors affecting low energy conversion efficiency and
      oxygen sensitivity of hydrogen-producing enzymes. Noting that the most practical 
      pathway of biohydrogen generation was sulfur-deprivation compared with
      phosphorus, nitrogen, and magnesium deficiency. Further discussions in this work 
      summarized the recent advancement in biohydrogen production from microalgae such 
      as genetic engineering, microalgae-bacteria consortium,
      electro-bio-hydrogenation, and nanomaterials for developing enzyme stability and 
      hydrolytic efficiency. More importantly, this review provided a summary of
      current limitations and future perspectives on the sustainable production of
      biohydrogen from microalgae.

AB  - Suitable illumination project would help in achieving high light conversion
      efficiency (LCE) for photo-fermentation. This study proposed an improvement
      strategy for LCE of photo-fermentative hydrogen production (PFHP) with a
      photosynthetic consortium by adopting light-dark duration alternation. For this
      purpose, 6 projects (continues light, 24 h light + 24 h dark, 24 h dark + 24 h
      light, 48 h light + 48 h light, 48 h dark + 48 h light, and continues dark) light
      disturbances were carried out to estimate the strategy. The fluctuation of cell
      growth (OD660) was corresponded to the light-dark alternation. 24 h dark + 24 h
      light alternation achieved the maximum hydrogen yield (HY) of 390.9 mL/g TS cell 
      (6.7 % higher than continuous light) and maximum improvement of LCE of 114.7%.
      Moreover, heat map analysis revealed that the light period after inoculation had 
      the closest relation (Pearson's r = 1) with the average hydrogen production rate 
      (HPR) of photo-fermentation. Besides, decreased dark period after inoculation
      would increase the hydrogen yield of photo-fermentation.

AB  - Microalgae contribute significantly to the global carbon cycle through
      photosynthesis. Given their ability to efficiently convert solar energy and
      atmospheric carbon dioxide into chemical compounds, such as carbohydrates, and
      generate oxygen during the process, microalgae represent an excellent and
      feasible carbohydrate bioresource. Microalgae-based biofuels are technically
      viable and, delineate a green and innovative field of opportunity for bioenergy
      exploitation. Microalgal polysaccharides are one of the most versatile groups for
      biotechnological applications and its content can be increased by manipulating
      cultivation conditions. Microalgal carbohydrates can be used to produce a variety
      of biofuels, including bioethanol, biobutanol, biomethane, and biohydrogen. This 
      review provides an overview of microalgal carbohydrates, focusing on their use as
      feedstock for biofuel production, highlighting the carbohydrate metabolism and
      approaches for their enhancement. Moreover, biofuels produced from microalgal
      carbohydrate are showed, in addition to a new bibliometric study of current
      literature on microalgal carbohydrates and their use.

AB  - Alarming environmental impacts have been resulted across the globe due to the
      recovery and consumption of fossil fuels. The elevated global carbon footprint
      has paved the way to an alternative to combat the prevalent pollution. On the
      other hand, the fossil-based plastics produced from the byproducts of petroleum
      remain intact in the environment leading to pollution. Fossil abated bioproducts 
      are in high demand due to the increase in pollution. This call to utilize
      feedstock for simultaneous production of biologically useful products through
      carbon capture utilisation where the leftover carbon-rich substrate is converted 
      into usable chemicals like bioplastics, methanol, urea and various other
      industrially essential components. The present review extensively focuses on the 
      research and economic perspectives of an integrated biorefinery and addresses
      technical breaches, bottlenecks, and efficient strategies for the simultaneous
      production of biohydrogen and polyhydroxyalkanoates.

AB  - Presently, fossil fuels are extensively employed as major sources of energy, and 
      their uses are considered unsustainable due to emissions of obnoxious gases on
      the burning of fossil fuels, which can lead to severe environmental
      complications, including human health. To tackle these issues, various processes 
      are developing to waste as a feed to generate eco-friendly fuels. The biological 
      production of fuels is considered to be more beneficial than physicochemical
      methods due to their environmentally friendly nature, high rate of conversion at 
      ambient physiological conditions, and less energy-intensive. Among various
      biofuels, hydrogen (H2) is considered as a wonderful due to high calorific value 
      and generate water molecule as end product on the burning. The H2 production from
      biowaste is demonstrated, and agri-food waste can be potentially used as a
      feedstock due to their high biodegradability over lignocellulosic-based biomass. 
      Still, the H2 production is uneconomical from biowaste in fuel competing market
      because of low yields and increased capital and operational expenses. Anaerobic
      digestion is widely used for waste management and the generation of value-added
      products. This article is highlighting the valorization of agri-food waste to
      biofuels in single (H2) and two-stage bioprocesses of H2 and CH4 production.

AB  - Lignocellulose has been considered a potential feedstock for biohydrogen
      production. Recently, a novel closed-loop concept of biochar approach was
      developed for enhanced lignocellulosic biohydrogen production. This study
      therefore targets to analyze the environmental impacts of the three existing
      lignocellulosic biohydrogen production processes, and evaluate the environmental 
      performance of applying biochar in each process at this early stage of
      technological development. The results suggest that biochar dosing shows better
      environmental performance for all impact categories, especially in the
      consolidate bioprocessing case. Electricity consumption was found to be the
      dominant cause of environmental impact over the life cycle, while by-products
      generation was also found to have an effect on the life-cycle impacts. Future
      research focuses on the biohydrogen production scale, the electricity generation 
      scheme transition towards renewable and cleaner energetic systems, and recovery
      the by-products to the maximum extent, that will make lignocellulosic biohydrogen
      production more environmentally sustainable.

TI  - Characterization and adaptation of Caldicellulosiruptor strains to higher sugar
      concentrations, targeting enhanced hydrogen production from lignocellulosic
      hydrolysates.
PG  - 210
LID - 10.1186/s13068-021-02058-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The members of the genus Caldicellulosiruptor have the potential for 
      future integration into a biorefinery system due to their capacity to generate
      hydrogen close to the theoretical limit of 4 mol H2/mol hexose, use a wide range 
      of sugars and can grow on numerous lignocellulose hydrolysates. However, members 
      of this genus are unable to survive in high sugar concentrations, limiting their 
      ability to grow on more concentrated hydrolysates, thus impeding their industrial
      applicability. In this study five members of this genus, C. owensensis, C.
      kronotskyensis, C. bescii, C. acetigenus and C. kristjanssonii, were developed to
      tolerate higher sugar concentrations through an adaptive laboratory evolution
      (ALE) process. The developed mixed population C. owensensis CO80 was further
      studied and accompanied by the development of a kinetic model based on Monod
      kinetics to quantitatively compare it with the parental strain. RESULTS: Mixed
      populations of Caldicellulosiruptor tolerant to higher glucose concentrations
      were obtained with C. owensensis adapted to grow up to 80 g/L glucose; other
      strains in particular C. kristjanssonii demonstrated a greater restriction to
      adaptation. The C. owensensis CO80 mixed population was further studied and
      demonstrated the ability to grow in glucose concentrations up to 80 g/L glucose, 
      but with reduced volumetric hydrogen productivities ([Formula: see text]) and
      incomplete sugar conversion at elevated glucose concentrations. In addition, the 
      carbon yield decreased with elevated concentrations of glucose. The ability of
      the mixed population C. owensensis CO80 to grow in high glucose concentrations
      was further described with a kinetic growth model, which revealed that the
      critical sugar concentration of the cells increased fourfold when cultivated at
      higher concentrations. When co-cultured with the adapted C. saccharolyticus G5
      mixed culture at a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 20 h, C. owensensis
      constituted only 0.09-1.58% of the population in suspension. CONCLUSIONS: The
      adaptation of members of the Caldicellulosiruptor genus to higher sugar
      concentrations established that the ability to develop improved strains via ALE
      is species dependent, with C. owensensis adapted to grow on 80 g/L, whereas C.
      kristjanssonii could only be adapted to 30 g/L glucose. Although C. owensensis
      CO80 was adapted to a higher sugar concentration, this mixed population
      demonstrated reduced [Formula: see text] with elevated glucose concentrations.
      This would indicate that while ALE permits adaptation to elevated sugar
      concentrations, this approach does not result in improved fermentation
      performances at these higher sugar concentrations. Moreover, the observation that
      planktonic mixed culture of CO80 was outcompeted by an adapted C.
      saccharolyticus, when co-cultivated in continuous mode, indicates that the
      robustness of CO80 mixed culture should be improved for industrial application.

TI  - Knowing the enemy: homoacetogens in hydrogen production reactors.
PG  - 8989-9002
LID - 10.1007/s00253-021-11656-6 [doi]
AB  - One of the bottlenecks of the hydrogen production by dark fermentation is the low
      yields obtained because of the homoacetogenesis persistence, a metabolic pathway 
      where H2 and CO2 are consumed to produce acetate. The central reactions of H2
      production and homoacetogenesis are catalyzed by enzyme hydrogenase and the
      formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase, respectively. In this work, genes encoding for
      the formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase (fthfs) and hydrogenase (hydA) were used to
      investigate the diversity of homoacetogens as well as their phylogenetic
      relationships through quantitative PCR (qPCR) and next-generation amplicon
      sequencing. A total of 70 samples from 19 different H2-producing bioreactors with
      different configurations and operating conditions were analyzed. Quantification
      through qPCR showed that the abundance of fthfs and hydA was strongly associated 
      with the type of substrate, organic loading rate, and H2 production performance. 
      In particular, fthfs sequencing revealed that homoacetogens diversity was low
      with one or two dominant homoacetogens in each sample. Clostridium carboxivorans 
      was detected in the reactors fed with agave hydrolisates; Acetobacterium woodii
      dominated in systems fed with glucose; Blautia coccoides and unclassified
      Sporoanaerobacter species were present in reactors fed with cheese whey; finally,
      Eubacterium limosum and Selenomonas sp. were co-dominant in reactors fed with
      glycerol. Altogether, quantification and sequencing analysis revealed that the
      occurrence of homoacetogenesis could take place due to (1) metabolic changes of
      H2-producing bacteria towards homoacetogenesis or (2) the displacement of
      H2-producing bacteria by homoacetogens. Overall, it was demonstrated that the

AB  - This study aimed a high-rate dark fermentative H2 production from xylose using a 
      dynamic membrane module bioreactor (DMBR) with a 444-mum pore polyester mesh. 20 
      g xylose/L was fed continuously to the DMBR at different hydraulic retention
      times (HRTs) from 12 to 3 h at 37 degrees C. The maximum average H2 yield (HY)
      and H2 production rate (HPR) at 3 h HRT were found to be 1.40 +/- 0.07 mol H2/mol
      xyloseconsumed and 30.26 +/- 1.19 L H2/L-d, respectively. The short HRT resulted 
      in the maximum suspended biomass concentration (8.92 +/- 0.40 g VSS/L) along with
      significant attached biomass retention (7.88 +/- 0.22 g VSS/L). H2 was produced
      by both butyric and acetic acid pathways. Low HY was concurrent with lactic acid 
      production. The bacterial population shifted from non-H2 producers, such as
      Lactobacillus and Sporolactobacillus spp., to Clostridium sp., when HY increased.
      Thus, xylose from lignocellulose is a feasible substrate for dark fermentative H2
      production using DMBR.

AB  - In this review article, discuss the many ways utilized by the dairy sector to
      treat pollutants, emphasizing their influence on the quality and efficiency with 
      which contamination is removed. It focuses on biotechnology possibilities for
      valorizing dairy waste in particular. The findings revealed that dairy waste may 
      be treated using physicochemical, biological, and biotechnological techniques.
      Notably, this article highlighted the possibility of dairy waste being used as a 
      feedstock not only for the generation of biogas, bioethanol, biohydrogen,
      microbial fuel cells, lactic acid, and fumaric acid via microbial technology but 
      also for the production of biooil and biochar by pyrolysis. In addition, this
      article critically evaluates the many treatment techniques available for
      recovering energy and materials from dairy waste, their combinations, and
      implementation prospects. Valorization of dairy waste streams presents an
      opportunity to extend the dairy industry's presence in the fermented functional
      beverage sector.

AB  - Globally, abundant agricultural wastes (AWs) are being generated each day to
      fulfil the increasing demands of the fast-growing population. The limited and/or 
      improper management of the same has created an urgent need to devise strategies
      for their timely utilization and valorisation, for agricultural sustainability
      and human-food and health security. The AWs are generated from different sources 
      including crop residue, agro-industries, livestock, and aquaculture. The main
      component of the crop residue and agro-industrial waste is cellulose, (the most
      abundant biopolymer), followed by lignin and hemicellulose (lignocellulosic
      biomass). The AWs and their processing are a global issue since its vast majority
      is currently burned or buried in soil, causing pollution of air, water and global
      warming. Traditionally, some crop residues have been used in combustion, animal
      fodder, roof thatching, composting, soil mulching, matchsticks and paper
      production. But, lignocellulosic biomass can also serve as a sustainable source
      of biofuel (biodiesel, bioethanol, biogas, biohydrogen) and bioenergy in order to
      mitigate the fossil fuel shortage and climate change issues. Thus, valorisation
      of lignocellulosic residues has the potential to influence the bioeconomy by
      producing value-added products including biofertilizers, bio-bricks, bio-coal,
      bio-plastics, paper, biofuels, industrial enzymes, organic acids etc. This review
      encompasses circular bioeconomy based various AW management strategies, which
      involve 'reduction', 'reusing' and 'recycling' of AWs to boost sustainable
      agriculture and minimise environmental pollution.

AB  - Sustainable production of fuels and chemicals is the most important way to reduce
      the carbon footprint in the environment. Forest based abundant lignocellulosic
      biomass as a renewable feedstock can be an attractive source of biofuels and
      biochemicals. This study evaluated the production of hydrogen (H2) along with
      platform chemicals from an organosol pretreated birch sawdust (SD). Acidogenic
      fermentation (AF) of pretreated SD resulted in production of green H2 (121.4
      mL/gVS) along with short (17.8 g/L) and medium (2.64 g/L) chain carboxylic acids.
      Further integration of AF with anaerobic digestion (AD) in a biorefinery
      framework offered production of biomethane (bioCH4: 246 mL/gVS) from the leftover
      SD from AF. Integration of bioH2 with bioCH4 at different time interval of
      digestion showed 8-14 L biohythane formation ran with a H2 fraction of 1.6-0.3
      H2/(H2 + CH4) documenting energy content of 8-9.08 kJ/gVS.

AB  - The need to develop sustainable alternatives for pretreatment and hydrolysis of
      lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) is a massive concern in the industrial sector
      today. Breaking down of LCB yields sugars and fuel in the bulk scale. If explored
      under nanotechnology, LCB can be refined to yield high-performance fuel sources. 
      The toxicity and cost of conventional methods can be reduced by applying
      nanoparticles (NPs) in refining LCB. Immobilization of enzymes onto NPs or used
      in conjugation with nanomaterials would instill specific and eco-friendly options
      for hydrolyzing LCB. Nanomaterials increase the proficiency, reusability, and
      stability of enzymes. Notably, magnetic NPs have bagged their place in the
      downstream processing of LCB effluents due to their efficient separation and
      cost-effectiveness. The current review highlights the role of nanotechnology and 
      its particles in refining LCB into various commercial precursors and value-added 
      products. The relationship between nanotechnology and LCB refinery is portrayed
      effectively in the present study.

TI  - New Approach for the Construction and Calibration of Gas-Tight Setups for
      Biohydrogen Production at the Small Laboratory Scale.
LID - 667 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/metabo11100667 [doi]
AB  - Biohydrogen production in small laboratory scale culture vessels is often
      difficult to perform and quantitate. One problem is that commonly used silicon
      tubing and improvised plastic connections used for constructing apparatus are
      cheap and easy to connect but are generally not robust for gases such as
      hydrogen. In addition, this type of apparatus presents significant safety
      concerns. Here, we demonstrate the construction of hydrogen-tight apparatus using
      a commercially available modular system, where plastic tubing and connections are
      made of explosion-proof dissipative plastic material. Using this system, we
      introduce a gas chromatograph calibration procedure, which can be easily
      performed without necessarily resorting to expensive commercial gas standards for
      the calibration of hydrogen gas concentrations. In this procedure, the amount of 
      hydrogen produced by the reaction of sodium borohydride with water in a closed
      air-filled bottle is deduced from the observed decrease of the oxygen partial
      pressure, using the ideal gas law. Finally, the determined calibration
      coefficients and the gas-tight apparatus are used for the analysis of
      simultaneous oxygen consumption and hydrogen production of the purple
      photosynthetic bacterium, Rhodospirillum rubrum, during semi-aerobic growth in
      the dark.

TI  - Enhancing Hydrogen Productivity of Photosynthetic Bacteria from the Formulated
      Carbon Source by Mixing Xylose with Glucose.
PG  - 3996-4017
LID - 10.1007/s12010-021-03708-4 [doi]
AB  - To develop an efficient photofermentative process capable of higher rate
      biohydrogen production using carbon components of lignocellulosic hydrolysate, a 
      desired carbon substrate by mixing xylose with glucose was formulated. Effects of
      crucial process parameters affecting cellular biochemical reaction of hydrogen by
      photosynthetic bacteria (PSB), i.e., variation in initial concentration of total 
      carbon, glucose content in initial carbon substrate, and light intensity, were
      experimentally investigated using response surface methodology (RSM) with a
      Box-Behnken design (BBD). Hydrogen production rate (HPR) in the maximum value of 
      30.6 mL h(-1) L(-1) was attained under conditions of 39 mM initial concentration 
      of total carbon, 59% (mol/mol) glucose content in initial carbon substrate, and
      12.6 W m(-2) light intensity at light wavelength of 590 nm. Synergic effects of
      metabolizing such a well-formulated carbon substrate for sustaining the active
      microbial synthesis to sufficiently accumulate biomass in bioreactor, as well as 
      stimulating enzyme activity of nitrogenase for the higher rate biohydrogen
      production, were attributed to this carbon substrate that can enable PSB to
      maintain the relatively consistent microenvironment in suitable culture pH
      condition during the optimized photofermentative process.

AB  - In the present study, a dark fermentation system inoculated with mixed culture
      bacteria (MCB) was developed using prepared alkali-based magnetic nanosheets
      (AMNSs) to facilitate biohydrogen (BioH2) production. The highest BioH2 yields of
      232.8 +/- 8.5 and 150.3 +/- 4.8 mL/g glucose were observed at 100 (mesophilic
      condition) and 400 (thermophilic condition) mg/L AMNSs groups, which were 65.4%
      and 43.3%, respectively, above the 0 mg/L AMNSs group. The fermentation pathway
      revealed that AMNSs enhanced the butyrate-type metabolic pathway and the
      corresponding nicotinamide adenine dinucleotides (NADHand NAD(+)) ratio, and
      hydrogenase activity was enhanced in mesophilic fermentation. The interaction of 
      AMNSs and MCB suggested that AMNSs could assist in electron transfer and that the
      released metal elements might be responsible for elevated hydrogenase activity.
      AMNSs also promoted the evolution of the dominant microbial community and altered
      the content of extracellular polymers, leading to increased production of BioH2.

AB  - As a clean and renewable energy, bioenergy is one of the most promising
      alternatives to fossil fuels. Lignocellulose possesses great potential for
      bioenergy production, but the recalcitrant and heterogeneous structure limits its
      application. Pretreatment technology offers an effective solution to fractionate 
      the main components of the lignocellulose and uncover the available cellulose.
      The obtained feedstock can be applied to bioconversion into energy, e.g.,
      bioethanol, biogas, biohydrogen, etc. Here, the current state of lignocellulose
      pretreatment technologies was comprehensively reviewed, the advances in bioenergy
      production from pretreated lignocellulose was described, with particular
      attention to key challenges involved. Several new strategies for overcoming
      pretreatment barriers to realize highly efficient lignocellulose bioconversion
      were highlighted. The insights given in this review will facilitate further
      development on lignocellulosic bioenergy production, towards addressing the
      global energy crisis and climate change related to the use of fossil fuels.

AB  - Dark fermentation process for simultaneous wastewater treatment and H2 production
      is gaining attention. This study aimed to use machine learning (ML) procedures to
      model and analyze H2 production from wastewater during dark fermentation.
      Different ML procedures were assessed based on the mean squared error (MSE) and
      determination coefficient (R(2)) to select the most robust models for modeling
      the process. The research showed that gradient boosting machine (GBM), support
      vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF) and AdaBoost were the most appropriate
      models, which were optimized by grid search and deeply analyzed by permutation
      variable importance (PVI) to identify the relative importance of process
      variables. All four models demonstrated promising performances in predicting H2
      production with high R(2) values (0.893, 0.885, 0.902 and 0.889) and small MSE
      values (0.015, 0.015, 0.016 and 0.015). Moreover, RF-PVI demonstrated that
      acetate, butyrate, acetate/butyrate, ethanol, Fe and Ni were of high importance
      in decreasing order.

AB  - Antibiotic fermentation residue (AFR) has been categorized as hazardous waste in 
      China. Anaerobic biohydrogen fermentation may be a promising technology for
      handling AFR, which could achieve dual goals of waste treatment and clean energy 
      production at the same time. However, the low hydrogen yield and low removal
      efficiency of residual antibiotics are two major factors limiting the AFR
      biohydrogen fermentation process. This work firstly applied gamma radiation (50
      kGy) to remove the residual antibiotic in AFR and improve the bioavailability of 
      organic matters, then adding nano zero-valent iron (nZVI) (100-1000 mg/L) to
      further enhance the AFR biohydrogen fermentation performance. Results showed that
      residual deacetoxycephalosporin C in AFR was removed with a high efficiency of
      98.6%, and hydrogen yield achieved 20.45 mL/g-VSadded with the combined approach 
      of gamma radiation pretreatment and 500 mg/L nZVI addition, which was 139.2%
      higher compared to the control experimental result. The combined approach also
      promoted the biohydrogen production rate, decreased the lag phase of hydrogen
      production, and increased the organics utilization. Microbiological analysis
      revealed that highly efficient hydrogen-producing genera Clostridium sensu
      stricto were enriched in much higher abundance with the combined approach, which 
      might be the fundamental mechanism for the enhanced AFR fermentation performance.

AB  - Global warming issues, rapid fossil fuel diminution, and increasing worldwide
      energy demands have diverted accelerated attention in finding alternate sources
      of biofuels and energy to combat the energy crisis. Bioconversion of
      lignocellulosic biomass has emerged as a prodigious way to produce various
      renewable biofuels such as biodiesel, bioethanol, biogas, and biohydrogen. Ideal 
      microbial hosts for biofuel synthesis should be capable of using high substrate
      quantity, tolerance to inhibiting substances and end-products, fast sugar
      transportation, and amplified metabolic fluxes to yielding enhanced fermentative 
      bioproduct. Genetic manipulation and microbes' metabolic engineering are
      fascinating strategies for the economical production of next-generation biofuel
      from lignocellulosic feedstocks. Metabolic engineering is a rapidly developing
      approach to construct robust biofuel-producing microbial hosts and an important
      component for future bioeconomy. This approach has been widely adopted in the
      last decade for redirecting and revamping the biosynthetic pathways to obtain a
      high titer of target products. Biotechnologists and metabolic scientists have
      produced a wide variety of new products with industrial relevance through
      metabolic pathway engineering or optimizing native metabolic pathways. This
      review focuses on exploiting metabolically engineered microbes as promising cell 
      factories for the enhanced production of advanced biofuels.

AB  - Currently identification of alternate fuel is the key area of research under
      progress to overcome the depletion of fossil fuels, meet the domestic and
      industrial requirements. Generation of hydrogen, which is a clean fuel gas can
      solve various environmental related problems. Extensive research is being carried
      out to increase production of hydrogen through different substrates. This study
      aims to increase the production of hydrogen from Ulva reticulata (a macroalgal
      biomass). Initially, the biomass is pretreated mechanically with disperser and a 
      biosurfactant, namely rhamnolipid in order to increase the solubilization of the 
      biomass. The rate of COD liquefaction increased from 14% to 25% with the addition
      of biosurfactant to the macroalgal biomass, which is further treated mechanically
      using a disperser. The disperser rotor speed of 12,000 rpm and the specific
      energy input of 1175 kJ/kg TS (Total Solids) with the disintegration time of 30
      min and biosurfactant dosage of 0.075 g/g TS were considered as the optimum
      parameters for the effective liquefaction of the macroalgal biomass.
      Approximately 3500 mg/L of the biopolymers were released after the combinative
      pretreatment (using disperser and biosurfactant). About 80 mL biohydrogen/g COD
      (Chemical Oxygen Demand) was generated when the biomass was pretreated with both 
      the disperser and biosurfactant while the biomass pretreated with the disperser
      alone generated just 30 mL biohydrogen/g COD and the untreated biomass generated 
      5 mL biohydrogen/g COD. Thus, it can be concluded that Ulva reticulata can be
      utilized effectively to generate biohydrogen.

AB  - Two various materials, copper and aluminum doped cobalt ferrite nanoparticles
      (NPs) were fabricated for investigating their effects of addition amounts on
      hydrogen (H2) synthesis and process stability. CoCu0.2Fe1.8O4NPs enhanced H2
      production more than CoAl0.2Fe1.8O4 NPs under same condition. The highest H2
      yield of 212.25 ml/g glucose was found at optimal dosage of 300 mg/L
      CoCu0.2Fe1.8O4 NPs, revealing the increases of 43.17% and 6.67% compared with the
      control without NPs and 300 mg/L CoAl0.2Fe1.8O4 NPs groups, respectively. NPs
      level of more than 400 mg/L inhibited H2 generation. Further investigations
      illustrated that CoCu0.2Fe1.8O4 NPs were mainly distributed on extracellular
      polymer substance while CoAl0.2Fe1.8O4 NPs were mostly enriched on cell membrane,
      which facilitated electron transfer behavior. Community structure composition
      demonstrated that CoCu0.2Fe1.8O4 and CoAl0.2Fe1.8O4 separately caused a 9.67% and
      9.03% increase in Clostridium sensu stricto 1 compared with the control reactor
      without NPs exposure.

AB  - The rapid growth in population has increased the demand for potable water.
      Available technologies for its generation are the desalination of sea water
      through reverse osmosis, electrodialysis etc., which are energy and cost
      intensive. In this context, microbial desalination cell (MDC) presents a low-cost
      and sustainable option which can simultaneously treat wastewater, desalinate
      saline water, produce electrical energy and recover nutrients from wastewater.
      This review paper is focussed on presenting a detailed analysis of MDCs starting 
      from the principle of operation, microbial community analysis, basic
      architecture, evolution in design, operational challenges, effect of process
      parameters, scale-up studies, application in multiple arenas and future
      prospects. After thorough review, it can be inferred that MDCs can be used as a
      stand-alone option or pre-treatment step for conventional desalination techniques
      without the application of external energy. MDCs have been used in multiple
      applications ranging from desalination, remediation of contaminated water,
      recovery of energy and nutrients from wastewater, softening of hardwater,
      biohydrogen production to degradation of waste engine oil. Although, MDCs have
      been used for multiple applications, still a number of operational challenges
      have been reported viz., interference of co-existing ions during desalination,
      membrane fouling, pH imbalance and limited potential of exoelectrogens. However, 
      the re-circulation of anolytes with electrodialysis chamber has led to the
      maintenance of optimal pH for favourable microbial growth leading to improvement 
      in the overall performance of MDCs. In future, genetic engineering may be used
      for improving the electrogenic activity of microbial community, next generation
      materials may be used as anode and cathode, varied sources of wastewater may be
      explored as anolytes, life cycle analysis and exergy analysis may be carried out 
      to study the impact on environment and detailed pilot scale studies have to be
      carried out for assessing the feasibility of operation at large scale.

AB  - Conventional wastewater treatment using activated sludge cannot efficiently
      eliminate nitrogen and phosphorus, thus engendering the risk of water
      eutrophication and ecosystem disruption. Fortunately, a new wastewater treatment 
      process applying microalgae-bacteria consortia has attracted considerable
      interests due to its excellent performance of nutrients removal. Moreover, some
      bacteria facilitate the harvest of microalgal biomass through bio-flocculation.
      Additionally, while stimulating the functional bacteria, the improved biomass and
      enriched components also brighten bioenergy production from the perspective of
      practical applications. Thus, this review first summarizes the current
      development of nutrients removal and mutualistic interaction using
      microalgae-bacteria consortia. Then, advancements in bio-flocculation are
      completely described and the corresponding mechanisms are thoroughly revealed.
      Eventually, the recent advances of bioenergy production (i.e., biodiesel,
      biohydrogen, bioethanol, and bioelectricity) using microalgae-bacteria consortia 
      are comprehensively discussed. Together, this review will provide the ongoing
      challenges and future developmental directions for better converting nitrogen and
      phosphorus wastewater into bioenergy using microalgae-bacteria consortia.

AB  - Numerous attempts have been made to upscale biohydrogen production via dark
      fermentation (DF); however, the Achilles' heel of DF, i.e., lactic acid bacteria 
      (LAB) contamination and overgrowth, hinders such upscaling. Key microbes are
      needed to develop a lactate-driven DF system that can serve as a lactate
      fermentation platform. In this study, the utility of Megasphaera elsdenii and LAB
      co-culturing in lactate-driven DF was evaluated. When inoculated simultaneously
      with LAB or after LAB culture, M. elsdenii achieved a stable hydrogen yield of
      0.95-1.49 H2-mol/mol-glucose, approximately half that obtained in pure M.
      elsdenii cultures. Hydrogen production was maintained even at an initial M.
      elsdenii-to-LAB cell ratio of one-millionth or less. Moreover, M. elsdenii
      produced hydrogen via lactate-driven DF from unusable sugars such as xylose or
      cellobiose. Thus, M. elsdenii could be a Game changer instrumental in unlocking
      the full potential of DF.

AB  - Microbial fermentation of organic matter under anaerobic conditions is currently 
      the prominent pathway for biohydrogen production. Organic matter present in waste
      residues is regarded as an economic feedstock for biohydrogen production by dark 
      and photo fermentative bacteria. Agricultural residues, fruit wastes, vegetable
      wastes, industrial wastewaters, and other livestock residues are some of the
      organic wastes most commonly used for biohydrogen production due to their higher 
      organic content and biodegradability. Appropriate pretreatments are required to
      enhance the performance of biohydrogen from complex organic wastes. Biohydrogen
      production could also be enhanced by optimizing operation conditions and the
      addition of essential nutrients and nanoparticles. This review describes the
      pathways of biohydrogen production, discusses the effect of organic waste sources
      used and microbes involved on biohydrogen production, along with addressing the
      key parameters, advantages, and difficulties in each biohydrogen production
      pathway.

TI  - Co-generation of biohydrogen and biochemicals from co-digestion of Chlorella sp. 
      biomass hydrolysate with sugarcane leaf hydrolysate in an integrated circular
      biorefinery concept.
PG  - 197
LID - 10.1186/s13068-021-02041-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A platform for the utilization of the Chlorella sp. biomass and
      sugarcane leaves to produce multiple products (biorefinery concept) including
      hydrogen, methane, polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), lipid, and soil supplement with 
      the goal to achieve the zero waste generation (circular economy) is demonstrated 
      in this study. Microalgal biomass were hydrolyzed by mixed enzymes while
      sugarcane leaves were pretreated with alkali followed by enzyme. Hydrolysates
      were used to produce hydrogen and the hydrogenic effluent was used to produce
      multi-products. Solid residues at the end of hydrogen fermentation and the
      remaining acidified slurries from methane production were evaluated for the
      compost properties. RESULTS: The maximum hydrogen yield of 207.65
      mL-H2/g-volatile solid (VS)added was obtained from 0.92, 15.27, and 3.82 g-VS/L
      of Chlorella sp. biomass hydrolysate, sugarcane leaf hydrolysate, and anaerobic
      sludge, respectively. Hydrogenic effluent produced 321.1 mL/g-VS of methane
      yield, 2.01 g/L PHAs concentration, and 0.20 g/L of lipid concentration. Solid
      residues and the acidified slurries at the end of the hydrogen and methane
      production process were proved to have compost properties. CONCLUSION: Hydrogen
      production followed by methane, PHA and lipid productions is a successful
      integrated circular biorefinery platform to efficiently utilize the hydrolysates 
      of Chlorella sp. biomass and sugarcane leaf. The potential use of the solid
      residues at the end of hydrogen fermentation and the remaining acidified slurries
      from methane production as soil supplements demonstrates the zero waste concept. 
      The approach revealed in this study provides a foundation for the optimal use of 
      feedstock, resulting in zero waste.

AB  - Biohydrogen (BioH2) is considered as one of the most environmentally friendly
      fuels and a strong candidate to meet the future demand for a sustainable source
      of energy. Presently, the production of BioH2 from photosynthetic organisms has
      raised a lot of hopes in the fuel industry. Moreover, microalgal-based BioH2
      synthesis not only helps to combat current global warming by capturing greenhouse
      gases but also plays a key role in wastewater treatment. Hence, this manuscript
      provides a state-of-the-art review of the upstream and downstream BioH2
      production processes. Different metabolic routes such as direct and indirect
      photolysis, dark fermentation, photofermentation, and microbial electrolysis are 
      covered in detail. Upstream processes (e.g. growth techniques, growth media) also
      have a great impact on BioH2 productivity and economics, which is also explored. 
      Technical and scientific obstacles of microalgae BioH2 systems are finally
      addressed, allowing the technology to become more innovative and commercial.

AB  - The present study reports Fe3O4 nanoparticles (Fe3O4 NPs) induced enhanced
      hydrogen production via co-fermentation of glucose and residual algal biomass
      (cyanobacteria Lyngbya limnetica). A significant enhancement of dark fermentative
      H2 production has been noticed under the influence of co-fermentation of glucose 
      and residual algal biomass using Fe3O4 NPs as catalyst. Further, using the
      optimized ratio of glucose to residual algal biomass (10:4), approximately 37.14 
      % higher cumulative H2 has been recorded in presence of 7.5 mg/L Fe3O4 NPs as
      compared to control at 37 degrees C. In addition, under the optimum conditions
      [glucose to residual algal biomass ratio (10:4)] presence of 7.5 mg/L Fe3O4 NPs
      produces approximately 937 mL/L cumulative H2 in 168 h at pH 7.5 and at
      temperature 40 degrees C. Clostridum butyrium, employed for the dark fermentation
      yielded approximately 7.7 g/L dry biomass in 168 h whereas acetate (9.0 g/L) and 
      butyrate (6.2 g/L) have been recorded as the dominating metabolites.

TI  - Hydrogen production by Enterobacter sp. LBTM 2 using sugarcane bagasse
      hemicellulose hydrolysate and a synthetic substrate: understanding and
      controlling toxicity.

AB  - Sugars released by thermochemical pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass are
      possible substrate for hydrogen production. However, the major drawback for
      bacterial fermentation is the toxicity of weak acids and furan derivatives
      normally present in such substrate. This study aimed to investigate the
      metabolism involved in hydrogen production by the isolate Enterobacter LBTM2
      using 10, 20 and 30-fold diluted synthetic (SH) and sugarcane bagasse
      hemicellulose (SBH) hydrolysates. In addition, the effects of acetic acid, formic
      acid and furfural on the bacterial metabolism, as well as detoxification of SBH
      with activated carbon and molecularly imprinted polymers on the hydrogen
      production were assessed. The results showed the best hydrogen yield was 0.46
      mmol H2/mmol sugar for 20-times diluted SH, which was 2.3-times higher than
      obtained in SBH experiments. Bacterial growth and hydrogen production were
      negatively affected by 0.8 g/L of acetic acid when added alone, but were totally 
      inhibited when formic acid (0.4 g/L) and furfural (0.3 g/L) were also supplied.
      However the maximum hydrogen production of SBH20 has duplicated when 3% of
      powdered activated carbon was added to the SBH experiment. The results presented 
      herein can be helpful in understanding the bottlenecks in biohydrogen production 
      and could contribute towards development of lignocellulosic biorefinery.

AB  - In biomass to biofuels production technology enzyme plays a key role.
      Nevertheless, the high production cost of cellulase enzyme is one of the critical
      issues in the economical production of biofuels. Nowadays, implementation of
      nanomaterials as catalyst is emerging as an innovative approach for the
      production of sustainable energy. In this context, synthesis of nickel cobaltite 
      nanoparticles (NiCo2O4 NPs) via in vitro route has been conducted using fungus
      Emericella variecolor NS3 meanwhile; its impact has been evaluated on improved
      thermal and pH stability of crude cellulase enzyme obtained from Emericella
      variecolor NS3. Additionally, bioconversion of alkali treated rice straw using
      NiCo2O4 NPs stabilized cellulase produced sugar hydrolyzate which is further used
      for H2 production via hybrid fermentation. Total 51.7 g/L sugar hydrolyzate
      produced 2978 mL/L cumulative H2 production after 336 h along with maximum rate
      34.12 mL/L/h in 24 h using Bacillus subtilis PF_1 and Rhodobacter sp. employed
      for dark and photo-fermentation, respectively.

AB  - This study examined the effect of various inocula on mixed-culture dark
      fermentative H2 production from food waste. Heat-treated and frozen H2-producing 
      granular sludge (HPG) grown with monomeric sugars showed a higher H2 yield,
      production rate, and acidogenic efficiency along with a shorter lag phase than
      heat-treated methanogenic sludge. Among three different methods of methanogenic
      sludge inoculation, inoculation after centrifugation showed better H2 production 
      performance. Propionic acid production and homoacetogenesis were regarded as
      major H2-consuming pathways when methanogenic sludge was used, whereas only
      homoacetogenesis was found in HPG-inoculated fermentation. During fermentation,
      the abundance of Clostridium increased greater than 48-fold for methanogenic
      sludge and greater than 108-fold for HPG, respectively. The initial abundance of 
      Clostridium showed a linear relationship with the H2 production rate and
      lag-phase time. The use of inoculum with a high abundance of Clostridium is
      essential for H2 production from food waste.

TI  - Palm oil industrial wastes as a promising feedstock for biohydrogen production: A
      comprehensive review.

AB  - By the year 2050, it is estimated that the demand for palm oil is expected to
      reach an enormous amount of 240 Mt. With a huge demand in the future for palm
      oil, it is expected that oil palm by-products will rise with the increasing
      demand. This represents a golden opportunity for sustainable biohydrogen
      production using oil palm biomass and palm oil mill effluent (POME) as the
      renewable feedstock. Among the different biological methods for biohydrogen
      production, dark fermentation and photo-fermentation have been widely studied for
      their potential to produce biohydrogen by using various waste materials as
      feedstock, including POME and oil palm biomass. However, the complex structure of
      oil palm biomass and POME, such as the lignocellulosic composition, limits
      fermentable substrate available for conversion to biohydrogen. Therefore, proper 
      pre-treatment and suitable process conditions are crucial for effective
      biohydrogen generation from these feedstocks. In this review, the characteristics
      of palm oil industrial waste, the process used for biohydrogen production using
      palm oil industrial waste, their pros and cons, and the influence of various
      factors have been discussed, as well as a comparison between studies in terms of 
      types of reactors, pre-treatment strategies, the microbial culture used, and
      optimum operating condition have been presented. Through biological production,
      hydrogen production rates up to 52 L-H2/L-medium/h and 6 L-H2/L-medium/h for
      solid and liquid palm oil industrial waste, respectively, can be achieved. In
      short, the continuous supply of palm oil production by-product and relatively,
      the low cost of the biological method for hydrogen production indicates the
      potential source of renewable energy.

AB  - Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is numerical strategy developed for simulating
      the behavior of liquid and gas flow. CFD may be applied starting from aerospace, 
      engine design, vehicle aerodynamics, power plants and chemical industries for
      analyzing and solving relevant system design and process issues. Biogas produced 
      during anaerobic digestion (AD) is sustainable and renewable alternative to
      fossil fuels. AD may improve the controlled production of biogas and offers
      significant environmental benefits. This review focuses on research outcomes
      relevant for enhanced biogas production by exploring the possible applications of
      CFD in AD technology. CFD-related research performed in AD conditions in order to
      improve mixing performance, reduce power consumption, and understand the effects 
      of total solid (TS) concentrations on flow behavior have been discussed. In
      addition, the use of AD for bio-hydrogen production, wastewater treatment, and
      sludge treatment are looked in. This review also identifies novel areas for AD
      technology advancement where there is potential for economic improvement in
      renewable energy production. Finally, future research needs have been identified,
      focusing on the opportunities to integrate conceptual and mathematical models for
      advancing CFD simulations for bioenergy.

AB  - Biohydrogen using migrated ammonia as nitrogen source, and biogas upgrading with 
      hydrogen collected at biocathode in an integrated bioelectrochemical system (BES)
      were investigated, during the anaerobic digestion of Taihu blue algae. Under an
      applied voltage of 0.4 V, biohydrogen (202.87 mL) reached 2.34 and 2.90 times
      than groups with applied voltage of 0 V and 0.8 V, respectively. Moreover,
      biohydrogen of the group with 1000 mg/L initial ammonia addition (524.16 mL)
      reached 1.53 times than that the of the control. With 0.25 bar of H2 injected at 
      the beginning (R1), highest methane production (286.62) mL and content (75.73%)
      were obtained. Comparing to other groups, not only microbial genus responsible
      for both aceticlastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens of the group R1 were
      apparently enriched, but key enzymes related to methane production also acquired 
      better abundances. Therefore, it's promising to conduct the ammonia alleviating, 
      hydrogen producing and biogas upgrading simultaneously using BES.

AB  - Biohydrogen and biosyngas are among the sustainable bioenergy products from
      biomass resources through gasification. Microwave-assisted gasification (MAG) is 
      still a novel technology, but it is definitely a promising conversion technology 
      to achieve a sustainable bioeconomy. Although this technology shows a massive
      potential to be fully implemented in the near future, the selectivity and
      efficiency of biohydrogen and syngas production still need enhancements and
      further research to secure a cost-effective and energy-efficient
      industrialization. This article comprehensively reviews the regular,
      microwave-induced plasma, and catalytic MAG systems in relation to their
      biohydrogen and biosyngas production, carbon conversion efficiency, and tar
      removal while discussing the significance of optimal operating conditions and
      considerations in the gasification system design. Several perspectives such as
      benefits, challenges, numerical simulations, and scalable opportunities are also 
      explored to provide factual insights for further research and industrial
      application.

AB  - Orange waste (OW), an abundant and severe globally environmental treat, was used 
      for biobutanol and biohydrogen production emploing acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) 
      fermentation through a biorefinery process. The solvent yield from untreated OW
      was insufficient; thus, the substrate was subjected to hydrothermal pretreatment 
      before hydrolysis. The pretreatment at 140 for 30 min resulted in the solid with 
      the highest yield of hydrolysis and fermentation. Moreover, the anaerobic
      digestion of hydrolysis residue produced appreciable amounts of biomethane.
      However, the pretreatment liquor was not fermentable; thus, it was detoxified by 
      overliming for 24 h at 30 and then fermented. Overall, this sustainable
      biorefinery, based on pretreatment without any additional chemical agent,
      hydrolysis of pretreated solids, detoxification of pretreatment liquor, ABE
      fermentation, and anaerobic digestion of residues, produced 42.3 g biobutanol,
      33.1 g acetone, 13.4 g ethanol, 104.5 L biohydrogen, and 28.3 L biomethane per kg
      of OW that contained 4560 kJ energy.

AB  - The present investigation is proposed to assess the competency of Sodium
      Persulphate (SPS) induced enzyme secreting bacterial pretreatment in enhancing
      the generation of biohydrogen from waste activated sludge (WAS). Alkali activated
      SPS of dosage 0.015 g/g SS has been opted to disseminate the floc structure to
      fortify the release of Extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) into aqueous
      phase. This removal of EPS enhances the bacterial disintegration fostering 18.71%
      of suspended solids reduction and 21% of COD solubilization which was
      comparatively higher than bacterially pretreated (BP) and control (C) sludge.
      Biohydrogen production of control (C), bacterially pretreated (BP) and SPS
      mediated bacterially pretreated (SPS-BP) sludge were found to be 32.2 mLH2/g COD,
      48.3 mLH2/g COD and 103.8 mLH2/g COD respectively. The net energy production of
      SPS - BP is 0.01 kWh which is higher than the C and BP sample during the entire
      treatment and obtained energy ratio greater than 1.

AB  - Present study provides biohydrogen production methods from waste furniture via
      catalytic steam gasification with bio-char catalysts (raw char, KOH-activated
      char and steam-activated char). Total gas yield for the prepared chars was in the
      order of KOH-activated char > steam-activated char > raw char, whereas, H2
      selectivity was in the sequence of raw char > steam-activated char >
      KOH-activated char. Though KOH-activated char showed the highest gas yield,
      highest H2 selectivity was obtained at the gasification experiment with raw char 
      due to the large amount of Ca and K and its reasonable surface area (146.89
      m(2)/g). Although the activation of raw biochar results in the increase of gas
      yield, it has the negative effect on H2 generation due to the removal of alkali
      and alkaline earth metals for the KOH activated char and steam-activated char.
      This study shows that raw bio-char could be a potential solution for eco-friendly
      hydrogen production.

TI  - Improvement of CO2 and Acetate Coupling into Lactic Acid by Genetic Manipulation 
      of the Hyperthermophilic Bacterium Thermotoga neapolitana.
LID - 1688 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms9081688 [doi]
AB  - Capnophilic lactic fermentation (CLF) represents an attractive biotechnological
      process for biohydrogen production and synthesis of L-lactic acid from acetate
      and CO2. The present study focuses on a genetic manipulation approach of the
      Thermotoga neapolitana DSM33003 strain to enhance lactic acid synthesis by the
      heterologous expression of a thermostable acetyl-CoA synthetase that catalyses
      the irreversible acetate assimilation. Because of the scarcity of available
      genetic tools, each transformation step was optimized for T. neapolitana DSM33003
      to cope with the specific needs of the host strain. Batch fermentations with and 
      without an external source of acetate revealed a strongly increased lactate
      production (up to 2.5 g/L) for the recombinant strain compared to wild type. In
      the engineered bacterium, the assimilation of CO2 into lactic acid was increased 
      1.7 times but the hydrogen yield was impaired in comparison to the wild type
      strain. Analysis of fermentation yields revealed an impaired metabolism of
      hydrogen in the recombinant strain that should be addressed in future studies.
      These results offer an important prospective for the development of a sustainable
      approach that combines carbon capture, energy production from renewable source,
      and the synthesis of high value-added products, which will be addressed in future
      studies.

AB  - Microbial fermentation plays important roles in hydrogen production. Various
      methods to promote hydrogen production are being developed. Here, different
      magnetic field intensities (2.7 mT, 3.2 mT and 9.1 mT) were applied to the
      glucose fermentation system of Clostridium pasteurianum to evaluate the
      feasibility and effect of statistic magnetic field on hydrogen production. The
      results showed that the magnetic field intensity of 3.2 mT effectively enhanced
      the hydrogen production. The total glucose consumption reached 0.64 +/- 0.010
      mmol, the maximum hydrogen yield reached 2.34 +/- 0.020 mol H2/mol glucose, and
      the maximum hydrogen production rate reached 0.065 +/- 0.002 mmol/h. Compared
      with the control, the maximum biomass, carbon conversion efficiency and energy
      conversion efficiency were elevated by 366%, 114%, and 26.8%, respectively. Our
      results provide a new way for promotion of hydrogen production, better
      understanding of the interaction mechanism between magnetic field and
      microorganisms and for optimizing the hydrogen production.

TI  - Expression of Alternative Nitrogenases in Rhodopseudomonas palustris Is Enhanced 
      Using an Optimized Genetic Toolset for Rapid, Markerless Modifications.
PG  - 2167-2178
LID - 10.1021/acssynbio.0c00496 [doi]
AB  - The phototrophic bacterium Rhodopseudomonas palustris is emerging as a promising 
      biotechnological chassis organism, due to its resilience to a range of harsh
      conditions, a wide metabolic repertoire, and the ability to quickly regenerate
      ATP using light. However, realization of this promise is impeded by a lack of
      efficient, rapid methods for genetic modification. Here, we present optimized
      tools for generating chromosomal insertions and deletions employing
      electroporation as a means of transformation. Generation of markerless strains
      can be completed in 12 days, approximately half the time for previous
      conjugation-based methods. This system was used for overexpression of alternative
      nitrogenase isozymes with the aim of improving biohydrogen productivity.
      Insertion of the pucBa promoter upstream of vnf and anf nitrogenase operons drove
      robust overexpression up to 4000-fold higher than wild-type. Transcript
      quantification was facilitated by an optimized high-quality RNA extraction
      protocol employing lysis using detergent and heat. Overexpression resulted in
      increased nitrogenase protein levels, extending to superior hydrogen productivity
      in bioreactor studies under nongrowing conditions, where promoter-modified
      strains better utilized the favorable energy state created by reduced competition
      from cell division. Robust heterologous expression driven by the pucBa promoter
      is thus attractive for energy-intensive biosyntheses suited to the capabilities
      of R. palustris. Development of this genetic modification toolset will accelerate
      the advancement of R. palustris as a biotechnological chassis organism, and
      insights into the effects of nitrogenase overexpression will guide future efforts
      in engineering strains for improved hydrogen production.

AB  - Paper industries are water-intensive industries that produce large amount of
      wastewater containing dyes, toxicity and high nutrient content. These industries 
      require sustainable technology for their waste disposal and MEC could be one of
      them. However, effective MEC operation at neutral pH and ambient temperature
      requires economical and efficient cathodes that are capable to treat indusial
      wastewater along with recovery of energy/biohydrogen. Co-deposits of Nickel,
      Nickel-Cobalt and Nickel-Cobalt-Phosphorous on the surface of SS and Cu base
      metals distinctly were used as cathodes in MEC for the concurrent treatment of
      real paper industry wastewater and biohydrogen production. MECs were utilized in 
      batch mode at neutral pH, applied voltage of 0.6 V and 30 +/- 2 degrees C
      temperature with paper industry wastewater and activated sludge as microbial
      sources. The fabricated Nickel-Cobalt-Phosphorous gives the higher hydrogen
      production rate of 0.16 +/- 0.002 m(3)(H2) m(-3)d(-1) and 0.14 +/- 0.002 m(3)(H2)
      m (-3)d (-1) respectively, with ~33-42 % treatment efficiency for a 500 ml
      wastewater in 7-day batch cycle in both the cases; while it is lowest in the case
      of the control cathodes (SS1 (0.07 +/- 0.002 m(3)(H2) m(-3)d(-1)) & Cu1 (0.06 +/-
      0.004 m(3)(H2) m(-3)d(-1))). It was also found that fabricated cathodes have the 
      capability to treat industrial wastewater at ambient conditions efficiently with 
      higher energy recovery. Prepared cathodes show enhanced hydrogen production and
      treatment efficiency as well as are competitive to some reported literature.

AB  - Microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) can be utilized for the simultaneous treatment 
      of actual industry wastewater and biohydrogen production. However, efficient and 
      cost-effective cathode, working at ambient conditions and neutral pH, are
      required to make the MEC as a sustainable technology. In this study, MEC with
      electrodeposited cathodes (co-deposits of Ni, Ni-Co and Ni-Co-P) were utilized to
      evaluate the treatment efficiency and hydrogen recovery of sugar industry
      wastewater. MECs operation was carried out at 30 +/- 2 degrees C temperature in
      batch mode at an applied voltage of 0.6 V in neutral pH with sugar industry
      effluent (COD 4850 +/- 50 mg L(-1), BOD 1950 +/- 20 mg L(-1)) and activated
      sludge as a source of microorganism. The Ni-Co-P electrodeposit on both cases
      achieved the maximum H2 production rate of 0.24 +/- 0.005 m(3)(H2) m(-3) d(-1)
      and 0.21 +/- 0.005 m(3)(H2) m(-3) d(-1) with ~50 % treatment efficiency for a 500
      ml effluent in 7 days' batch cycles. It was also found that fabricated cathodes
      can treat real wastewater efficiently with considerable energy recovery than
      previously reported literature. This study showed the potentiality of the
      real-time industrial effluents treatment and biohydrogen production near to
      ambient atmospheric conditions that emphasizes the waste to energy
      bio-electrochemical system.

TI  - Role of xylose from acidic hydrolysates of agave bagasse during biohydrogen
      production.
PG  - 656-666
LID - 10.2166/wst.2021.242 [doi]
AB  - This study compares the H2 production from glucose, xylose, and acidic
      hydrolysates of Agave tequilana bagasse as substrates. The fermentation was
      performed in a granular sludge reactor operated in two phases: (1) model
      substrates (glucose and xylose) and (2) acidic hydrolysates at 35 degrees C, pH
      4.5 and a hydraulic retention time of 5.5 h with glucose (10 g L(-1)) and xylose 
      (12 g L(-1)). A sequencing batch reactor was used to acclimate the biomass
      between the glucose and xylose continuous fermentation (with a mixture of
      xylose-glucose) and acidic hydrolysates. During the discontinuous acclimating
      step, the xylose/glucose ratio increment negatively affected the H2 productivity.
      Although the continuous H2 production with xylose was negligible, the
      co-fermentation with glucose (88-12%) allowed H2 productivity of 2,889 +/- 502 mL
      H2 L(-1)d(-1). An acidic hydrolysate concentration of 3.3 gcarbohydrate L(-1)
      showed a three-fold higher H2 productivity than with a concentration of 10 g
      L(-1). The results indicated that xylose, as the only substrate, was challenging 
      to metabolize by the inoculum, and its mixture with glucose improved the H2
      productivity. Therefore, the low H2 productivity with hydrolysates could be
      related to the presence of xylose.

PG  - 16350

AB  - Thermophilic biohydrogen production by dark fermentation from a mixture (1:1) of 
      C5 (arabinose) and C6 (glucose) sugars, present in lignocellulosic hydrolysates, 
      and from Sargassum sp. biomass, is studied in this work in batch assays and also 
      in a continuous reactor experiment. Pursuing the interest of studying
      interactions between inorganic materials (adsorbents, conductive and others) and 
      anaerobic bacteria, the biological processes were amended with variable amounts
      of a zeolite type-13X in the range of zeolite/inoculum (in VS) ratios (Z/I) of
      0.065-0.26 g g(-1). In the batch assays, the presence of the zeolite was
      beneficial to increase the hydrogen titer by 15-21% with C5 and C6-sugars as
      compared to the control, and an increase of 27% was observed in the batch
      fermentation of Sargassum sp. Hydrogen yields also increased by 10-26% with
      sugars in the presence of the zeolite. The rate of hydrogen production increased 
      linearly with the Z/I ratios in the experiments with C5 and C6-sugars. In the
      batch assay with Sargassum sp., there was an optimum value of Z/I of 0.13 g g(-1)
      where the H2 production rate observed was the highest, although all values were
      in a narrow range between 3.21 and 4.19 mmol L(-1) day(-1). The positive effect
      of the zeolite was also observed in a continuous high-rate reactor fed with C5
      and C6-sugars. The increase of the organic loading rate (OLR) from 8.8 to 17.6 kg
      m(-3) day(-1) of COD led to lower hydrogen production rates but, upon zeolite
      addition (0.26 g g(-1) VS inoculum), the hydrogen production increased
      significantly from 143 to 413 mL L(-1) day(-1). Interestingly, the presence of
      zeolite in the continuous operation had a remarkable impact in the microbial
      community and in the profile of fermentation products. The effect of zeolite
      could be related to several properties, including the porous structure and the
      associated surface area available for bacterial adhesion, potential release of
      trace elements, ion-exchanger capacity or ability to adsorb different compounds
      (i.e. protons). The observations opens novel perspectives and will stimulate
      further research not only in biohydrogen production, but broadly in the field of 
      interactions between bacteria and inorganic materials.

AB  - Macrophytes have been widely used as agents in wastewater treatment. The
      involvement of plants in wastewater treatment cannot be separated from wetland
      utilization. As one of the green technologies in wastewater treatment plants,
      wetland exhibits a great performance, especially in removing nutrients from
      wastewater before the final discharge. It involves the use of plants and
      consequently produces plant biomasses as treatment byproducts. The produced plant
      biomasses can be utilized or converted into several valuable compounds, but
      related information is still limited and scattered. This review summarizes
      wastewater's nutrient content (macro and micronutrient) that can support plant
      growth and the performance of constructed wetland (CW) in performing nutrient
      uptake by using macrophytes as treatment agents. This paper further discusses the
      potential of the utilization of the produced plant biomasses as bioenergy
      production materials, including bioethanol, biohydrogen, biogas, and biodiesel.
      This paper also highlights the conversion of plant biomasses into animal feed,
      biochar, adsorbent, and fertilizer, which may support clean production and

TI  - Enhancement of biohydrogen production rate in Rhodospirillum rubrum by a dynamic 
      CO-feeding strategy using dark fermentation.
PG  - 168
LID - 10.1186/s13068-021-02017-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rhodospirillum rubrum is a purple non-sulphur bacterium that produces
      H2 by photofermentation of several organic compounds or by water gas-shift
      reaction during CO fermentation. Successful strategies for both processes have
      been developed in light-dependent systems. This work explores a dark fermentation
      bioprocess for H2 production from water using CO as the electron donor. RESULTS: 
      The study of the influence of the stirring and the initial CO partial pressure
      (pCO) demonstrated that the process was inhibited at pCO of 1.00 atm. Optimal pCO
      value was established in 0.60 atm. CO dose adaptation to bacterial growth in
      fed-batch fermentations increased the global rate of H2 production, yielding 27.2
      mmol H2 l(-1) h(-1) and reduced by 50% the operation time. A kinetic model was
      proposed to describe the evolution of the molecular species involved in gas and
      liquid phases in a wide range of pCO conditions from 0.10 to 1.00 atm.
      CONCLUSIONS: Dark fermentation in R. rubrum expands the ways to produce
      biohydrogen from CO. This work optimizes this bioprocess at lab-bioreactor scale 
      studying the influence of the stirring speed, the initial CO partial pressure and
      the operation in batch and fed-batch regimes. Dynamic CO supply adapted to the
      biomass growth enhances the productivity reached in darkness by other strategies 
      described in the literature, being similar to that obtained under light
      continuous syngas fermentations. The kinetic model proposed describes all the
      conditions tested.

TI  - Influence of Carbohydrate Additives on the Growth Rate of Microalgae Biomass with
      an Increased Carbohydrate Content.
LID - 381 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/md19070381 [doi]
AB  - Our study focused on investigating the possibilities of controlling the
      accumulation of carbohydrates in certain microalgae species (Arthrospira
      platensis Gomont, Chlorella vulgaris Beijer, and Dunaliella salina Teod) to
      determine their potential in biofuel production (biohydrogen). It was found that 
      after the introduction of carbohydrates (0.05 gL(-1)) into the nutrient medium,
      the growth rate of the microalgae biomass increased, and the accumulation of
      carbohydrates reached 41.1%, 47.9%, and 31.7% for Arthrospira platensis,
      Chlorella vulgaris, and Dunaliella salina, respectively. Chlorella vulgaris had
      the highest total carbohydrate content (a mixture of glucose, fructose, sucrose, 
      and maltose, 16.97%) among the studied microalgae, while for Arthrospira
      platensis and Dunaliella salina, the accumulation of total carbohydrates was
      9.59% and 8.68%, respectively. Thus, the introduction of carbohydrates into the
      nutrient medium can stimulate their accumulation in the microalgae biomass, an
      application of biofuel production (biohydrogen).

AB  - The complex structure of corncob is the bottleneck that restricts its efficient
      biohydrogen production. Hence, effective treatment is an important exploration to
      break this limitation. The effect of microwave irradiation (MI) on
      photo-fermentative biohydrogen production (PFHP) process was evaluated in this
      paper. Diverse conditions (irradiation time, microwave power, and surfactant
      addition) were applied. Comparisons of cumulative hydrogen yield (CHY),
      microstructure, liquid products, and substrate conversion efficiency (Sconv) were
      conducted. Results showed that the highest CHY of 27.34 +/- 1.13 mL/g TS was
      achieved when the corncob was treated by MI assisted with surfactant addition.
      Optimal treatment conditions (5.51 min irradiation time, 772.03 W microwave
      power, and 0.08 g/L rhamnolipids addition) were obtained. MI assisted with
      surfactant addition helped with the structure destroys and content degradation,
      displaying a great improves on PFHP. Lower ethanol content and higher butyric
      acid content were obtained. An 80.94% increase in CHY and Sconv of 90.44% were
      obtained than untreated corncob.

AB  - In natural microbial ecosystems the metabolic diversity of the organisms enables 
      interaction among the community members and allows them to engage in syntrophic
      interactions. With regard to biotechnology, artificial microbial consortium
      engineering is used to improve productivities and yields of bioprocesses.
      However, to achieve supreme productivity or efficiency at industrial scale,
      defined ecosystems must be physiologically well-selected to meet
      eco-biotechnological demands. Here, we present an artificial microbial consortia 
      design and engineering pipeline for developing dark fermentative biohydrogen
      production processes. The proposed pipeline might be considered as a blue-print
      for enhancing other bioprocesses that fundamentally face metabolic restrictions
      or kinetic limitations.

AB  - Tremendous population growth and industrialization have increased energy
      consumption unprecedentedly. The depletion of fossil-based energy supplies
      necessitates the exploration of solar, geothermal, wind, hydrogen, biodiesel,
      etc. as a clean and renewable energy source. Most of these energy sources are
      intermittent, while bioelectricity, biodiesel, and biohydrogen can be produced
      using abundantly available organic wastes regularly. The production of various
      energy resources requires materials that are costly and affect the applicability 
      at a large scale. Biomass-derived materials (biochar) are getting attention in
      the field of bioenergy due to their simple method of synthesis, high surface
      area, porosity, and availability of functional groups for easy modification.
      Biochar synthesis using various techniques is discussed and their use as an
      electrode (anodic/cathodic) in a microbial fuel cell (MFC), catalysts in
      transesterification, and anaerobic digestion for energy production are reviewed. 
      Renewable energy production using biochar would be a sustainable approach to
      create an energy secure world.

AB  - Biohydrogen production by photo fermentation is an attractive clean energy
      production approach with less environmental pollution and higher substrate
      conversion. In recent years, various measures have been used to improve
      biohydrogen production performance, but there is a lack of systematic and
      comprehensive summary and analysis. Hence, the recent literatures on enhancing
      biohydrogen production by photo fermentation were summarized, and the functional 
      mechanisms of enhancement strategies were explained. In this work, these measures
      were divided into four categories according to their roles in photo fermentation,
      including substrate pretreatment, bacterial modification and immobilization,
      additive addition, reactor design optimization. It can be concluded that the
      optimal enhancement conditions of each strategy were affected by substrate type, 
      strain and process parameters. According to the results of this work, it was
      expected to give readers a clear understanding and provide a scientific reference
      of the research of photosynthetic biohydrogen production.

AB  - This study aimed to achieve continuous biohydrogen production from red algal
      biomass using a dynamic membrane bioreactor (DMBR). The DMBR was continuously fed
      with pretreated Echeuma spinosum containing 20 g/L hexose. The highest average
      hydrogen production rate (HPR) of 21.58 +/- 1.59 L/L-d was observed at HRT 3 h,
      which was higher than previous reports for continuous H2 production from biomass 
      feedstock. Metabolic flux analysis revealed that butyric acid and propionic acid 
      were the major by-products of the H2-producing and H2-consuming pathways,
      respectively, of the algal biomass fermentation. Hydrogen consumption by
      propionic acid pathway could not be prevented completely by heat treatment.
      PICRUSt2 analysis predicted that Clostridium sp., Anaerostipes sp., and
      Caproiciproducens sp. might significantly contribute to the expression of both
      ferredoxin hydrogenase and propionate CoA-transferase. This study would provide
      the design and operational information on high-rate bioreactor for continuous
      hydrogen production using biomass.

AB  - Cyanobacterial biomass has constituted a crucial third and fourth-generation
      biofuel material, with great potential to synthesize a wide range of metabolites,
      mainly carbohydrates. Lately, carbohydrate-based biofuels from cyanobacteria,
      such as bioethanol, biohydrogen, and biobutanol, have attracted attention as a
      sustainable alternative to petroleum-based products. Cyanobacteria can perform a 
      simple process of saccharification, and extracted carbohydrates can be converted 
      into biofuels with two alternatives; the first one consists of a fermentative
      process based on bacteria or yeasts, while the second alternative consists of an 
      internal metabolic process of their own in intracellular carbohydrate content,
      either by the natural or genetic engineered process. This study reviewed
      carbohydrate-enriched cyanobacterial biomass as feedstock for biofuels. Detailed 
      insights on technical strategies and limitations of cultivation, polysaccharide
      accumulation strategies for further fermentation process were provided. Advances 
      and challenges in bioethanol, biohydrogen, and biobutanol production by
      cyanobacteria synthesis and an independent fermentative process are presented.
      Critical outlook on life-cycle assessment and techno-economical aspects for
      large-scale application of these technologies were discussed.

      dark fermentation of rice straw: Performance and microbial community
      characteristics.

AB  - Semi-continuous experiments were carried out in lab-scale continuous stirred tank
      reactors to evaluate the effects of fermentation temperature (37 +/- 1 degrees C 
      and 55 +/- 1 degrees C) and total solids (TS) contents (3 %, 6 %, and 12 %) on
      biohydrogen production from the dark fermentations (DF) of rice straw (RS) and
      the total operation duration was 105 days. The experimental results show that
      biohydrogen production (0.46-63.60 mL/g VSadded) from the thermophilic (55 +/- 1 
      degrees C) DF (TDF) was higher than the mesophilic (37 +/- 1 degrees C) DF (MDF) 
      (0.19-2.13 mL/g VSadded) at the three TS contents, and achieved the highest of
      63.60 +/- 2.98 mL/g VSadded at TS = 6 % in TDF. The pH, NH4(+)-N and total
      volatile fatty acid of fermentation liquids in the TDF were all higher than those
      in the MDF. The high abundance of lactic acid-producing bacteria resulted in low 
      biohydrogen produced at TS = 3 %. Under the TDF with TS = 6 %, the highest
      abundance of hydrolytic bacteria (Ruminiclostridium 54.24 %) led to the highest
      biohydrogen production. The increase of TS content from 6 % to 12 % induced
      degradation pathway changes from biohydrogen production to methane production.
      This study demonstrated that butyric acid fermentation was the main pathway to
      produce biohydrogen from RS in both DFs.

TI  - Biochar boosts dark fermentative H2 production from sugarcane bagasse by
      selective enrichment/colonization of functional bacteria and enhancing
      extracellular electron transfer.

AB  - The influence of biochar (BC) on anerobic digestion (AD) of organic wastes have
      been widely studied. However, the effect of BC on rate-limiting step during AD of
      lignocellulosic waste, i.e. the hydrolysis and acidogenesis step, is rarely
      studied and the underlying mechanisms have not been investigated. In this study, 
      the benefits of BC with respect to dark fermentative hydrogen production were
      explored in a fermentation system by a heat-shocked consortium from sewage sludge
      (SS) with pretreated sugarcane bagasse (PSCB) as carbon source. The results
      showed that biochar boosted biohydrogen production by 317.1% through stimulating 
      bacterial growth, improving critical enzymatic activities, manipulating the ratio
      of NADH/NAD(+) and enhancing electron transfer efficiency of fermentation system.
      Furthermore, cellulolytic Lachnospiraceae was efficiently enriched and
      electroactive bacteria were selectively colonized and the ecological niche was
      formed on the surface of biochar. Synergistic effect between functional bacteria 
      and extracellular electron transfer (EET) in electroactive bacteria were assumed 
      to be established and maintained by biochar amendment. This study shed light on
      the underlying mechanisms of improved performance of biohydrogen production from 
      lignocellulosic waste during mesophilic dark fermentation by BC supplementation.

TI  - High Performance of Biohydrogen Production in Packed-Filter Bioreactor via
      Optimizing Packed-Filter Position.
LID - 7462 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph18147462 [doi]
AB  - In this present investigation, a packed-filter bioreactor was employed to produce
      hydrogen utilizing an expired soft drink as a substrate. The effects of feeding
      substrate concentrations ranging from 19.51, 10.19, 5.34, 3.48, to 2.51 g total
      sugar/L were examined, and the position of the packed filter installed in the
      bioreactor at dimensionless heights (h/H) of 1/4, 2/4, 3/4, and 4/4 was studied. 
      The results revealed that with a substrate concentration of 20 g total sugar/L
      and a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 1 h, a packed filter placed at the
      half-height position of the bioreactor (h/H 2/4) has the optimal hydrogen
      production rate, hydrogen yield, and average biomass concentration in the
      bioreactor, resulting in 55.70 +/- 2.42 L/L/d, 0.90 +/- 0.06 mol H2/mol hexose,
      and 17.86 +/- 1.09 g VSS/L. When feeding substrate concentrations varied from 20,
      10, to 5 g total sugar/L with the packed-filter position at h/H 2/4, Clostridium 
      sp., Clostridium tyrobutyricum, and Bifidobacterium crudilactis were the
      predominant bacteria community. Finally, it was discovered that the packed-filter
      bioreactor can produce stable hydrogen in high-strength organic effluent.

AB  - In the recent years, microalgae have captured researchers' attention as the
      alternative feedstock for various bioenergy production such as biodiesel,
      biohydrogen, and bioethanol. Cultivating microalgae in wastewaters to
      simultaneously bioremediate the nutrient-rich wastewater and maintain a high
      biomass yield is a more economical and environmentally friendly approach. The
      incorporation of algal-bacterial interaction reveals the mutual relationship of
      microorganisms where algae are primary producers of organic compounds from CO2,
      and heterotrophic bacteria are secondary consumers decomposing the organic
      compounds produced from algae. This review would provide an insight on the
      challenges and future development of algal-bacterial consortium and its
      contribution in promoting a sustainable route to greener industry. It is believed
      that microalgal-bacterial consortia will be implemented in the near-future for
      sub-sequential treatment of wastewater bioremediation, bioenergy production and
      CO2 fixation, promoting sustainability and making extraordinary advancement in
      life sciences sectors.

AB  - With the increasing awareness of sustainable development, energy and environment 
      are becoming two of the most important issues of concern to the world today.
      Whole-cell-based photosynthetic biohybrid systems (PBSs), an emerging
      interdisciplinary field, are considered as attractive biosynthetic platforms with
      great prospects in energy and environment, combining the superiorities of
      semiconductor materials with high energy conversion efficiency and living cells
      with distinguished biosynthetic capacity. This review presents a systematic
      discussion on the synthesis strategies of whole-cell-based PBSs that demonstrate 
      a promising potential for applications in sustainable solar-to-chemical
      conversion, including light-facilitated carbon dioxide reduction and biohydrogen 
      production. In the end, the explicit perspectives on the challenges and future
      directions in this burgeoning field are discussed.

AB  - The aim of this work was to study the impact of basalt fiber (BF) on hydrogen
      fermentation of corn straw. The maximum of hydrogen yield and corn straw
      conversion rate respectively achieved 323.94 mL and 5.23% by adding 1.5 g/L BF
      particle with the size of 300-400 mesh, which increased by 15.74% and 15.6%
      respectively than control group. The BF could promote the growth of
      photosynthetic bacteria, subsequently influencing the products distribution and
      hydrogen generation. Overall, this investigation demonstrated that BF addition is
      an effective way to enhance biohydrogen production from corn straw.

AB  - Hydrogen production through biological route is the cleanest, renewable and
      potential way to sustainable energy generation. Productions of hydrogen via dark 
      and photo fermentations are considered to be more sustainable and economical
      approach over numerous existing biological modes. Nevertheless, both the
      biological modes suffer from certain limitations like low yield and production
      rate, and because of these practical implementations are still far away.
      Therefore, the present review provides an assessment and feasibility of
      integrated biohydrogen production strategy by combining dark and
      photo-fermentation as an advanced biochemical processing while using
      lignocellulosics biomass to improve and accelerate the biohydrogen production
      technology in a sustainable manner. This review also evaluates practical
      viability of the integrated approach for biohydrogen production along with the
      analysis of the key factors which significantly influence to elevate this
      technology on commercial ground with the implementation of various environment
      friendly and innovative approaches.

AB  - Anaerobic fermentation system is easy to become acidic due to the generation of
      small molecular acids, which will affect the metabolism of bacteria. Therefore,
      it is necessary to improve the acid resistance of system. In this work, the
      tolerance of photo-fermentative biohydrogen production system amended with
      biochar, nanoscale zero-valent iron (nZVI) and biochar + nZVI to acidic
      environment was studied. Results showed that additives improved the stability and
      performance of the photo fermentation. The best increment of biohydrogen from 0
      to 286.83 +/- 2.77 mL was obtained by adding biochar and nZVI together at the
      original pH of 4.5. The additive reduced the oxidation-reduction potential and
      promoted the consumption of acetate and butyrate. At initial pH of 5, 6 and 7,
      the highest biohydrogen yield of 361.02 +/- 10.11, 419.36 +/- 10.70 and 382.67
      +/- 25.08 mL was obtained by adding nZVI, respectively, representing 42%-44.45%
      increase compared with the control group under the same conditions.

      production.
PG  - 134

AB  - Biogas and biohydrogen are compatible gaseous biofuels that can be blended with
      natural gas for reticulated fuel supply to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
      Sustainably grown woody biomass is emerging as a potential feedstock in the
      production of biofuels. Woody biomass is widely available, uses non-arable land
      for plantation, does not require synthetic fertilisers to grow and acts as a
      carbon sink. The cellulose and hemicellulose fractions of wood are renewable
      sources of sugars that can be used for fermentative production of gaseous
      biofuels. However, widespread use of wood as a gaseous biofuel feedstock is
      constrained due to the recalcitrant nature of wood to enzymatic hydrolysis.
      Pretreatment makes cellulose and hemicellulose accessible to microbial enzymes to
      produce fermentable sugars. Here we review wood composition, its structure and
      different pretreatment techniques in the context of their effects on
      deconstruction of wood to improve hydrolysis and fermentative gaseous fuel
      production. The anaerobic digestion of pretreated wood for biogas and dark
      fermentation for biohydrogen production are discussed with reference to gas
      yields. Key advancements in lab-scale research are described for pretreatments
      and for pure, co- and mixed culture fermentations. Limitations to yield
      improvements are identified and future perspectives and prospects of gaseous
      biofuel production from woody biomass are discussed, with reference to new
      developments in engineered biocatalysts and process integration.

AB  - The increase in biofuel production by 2030, driven by the targets set at the 21st
      United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP21), will promote an
      increase in ethanol production, and consequently more vinasse generation.
      Sugarcane vinasse, despite having a high polluting potential due to its high
      concentration of organic matter and nutrients, has the potential to produce
      value-added resources such as volatile fatty acids (VFA), biohydrogen (bioH2) and
      biomethane (bioCH4) from anaerobic digestion. The objective of this paper is to
      present a critical review on the vinasse treatment by anaerobic digestion
      focusing on the final products. Effects of operational parameters on production
      and recovery of these resources, such as pH, temperature, retention time and type
      of inoculum were addressed. Given the importance of treating sugarcane vinasse
      due to its complex composition and high volume generated in the ethanol
      production process, this is the first review that evaluates the production of
      VFAs, bioH2 and bioCH4 in the treatment of this organic residue. Also, the
      challenges of the simultaneous production of VFA, bioH2 and bioCH4 and resources 
      recovery in the wastewater streams generated in flex-fuel plants, using sugarcane
      and corn as raw material in ethanol production, are presented. The installation
      of flex-fuel plants was briefly discussed, with the main impacts on the treatment
      process of these effluents either jointly or simultaneously, depending on the
      harvest season.

AB  - This work studied the sequential hydrogen production by dark and
      photo-fermentation (HPDPF) in continuous baffled bioreactors. Taken enzymatic
      hydrolysate of corn stover as initial carbon source, the influence of hydraulic
      retention time (HRT) of dark fermentation (DF) and the dilution ratio (DR) of
      dark fermentation effluents (DFEs) on the hydrogen production performance of the 
      combined fermentation system and electron distribution were investigated. For DF

AB  - This review is to describe various methods used for the treatment of cereal
      processing wastes and their efficiency to reduce environmental issues.
      Physico-chemical and biological methods have great potential for the treatment of
      cereal industrial waste. These methods can be used alone or in combination with
      effective treatment. Physico-chemical treatments are mostly employed for the
      pretreatment of cereal processing wastes that helps in reduced sludge formation
      during biological treatments. Biological treatments are mostly used owing to
      their high efficiency in removing pollutants, and less expensive than
      physico-chemical treatments. However, these treatments consume more time as
      compared to physico-chemical treatments. These treatments also proved to be
      efficient for a high rate of cereal waste conversion into value-added products.
      Thus, cereal industrial waste can result in value-added products such as
      biohydrogen, bioethanol, butanol, biogas and biocoal as biofuels, industrial
      valued enzymes, biomass, biofertilizer, proteins, organic acids, polysaccharides 
      and few others.

AB  - This investigation explored the co-fermentation of antibiotic fermentation
      residue (AFR) and fallen leaves for enhancing biohydrogen production, and
      analyzed the mechanism from the aspects of microbial activity, microbial
      community and functional genes. The results showed that the optimal mixing ratio 
      of AFR to leaves was 25:75 (VS basis), which balanced the substrate condition and
      synergistically enhanced the biohydrogen productivity, and the hydrogen yield was
      37.45 mL/g-VSadded, which was 438.8% and 9.2% higher compared to the sole AFR
      fermentation and the sole leaves fermentation, respectively. The co-fermentation 
      also improved the organics utilization and induced a more effective metabolic
      pathway. Further microbiology analysis found that the co-fermentation promoted
      the microbial activity, enriched more hydrogen-producing bacteria (Clostridium
      sensu stricto 1), and enhanced the expression of hydrogen-producing functional
      genes (e.g. genes encoding ferredoxin hydrogenase (EC 1.12.7.2) and
      pyruvate-ferredoxin oxidoreductase (EC 1.2.7.1)), which were fundamentally
      responsible for the synergistic biohydrogen fermentation.

AB  - Dairy manure (DM) is a kind of cheap cellulosic biomass resource which includes
      lignocellulose and mineral nutrients. Random stacks not only leads damage to the 
      environment, but also results in waste of natural resources. The traditional ways
      to use DM include returning it to the soil or acting as a fertilizer, which could
      reduce environmental pollution to some extent. However, the resource utilization 
      rate is not high and socio-economic performance is not utilized. To expand the
      application of DM, more and more attention has been paid to explore its potential
      as bioenergy or bio-chemicals production. This article presented a comprehensive 
      review of different types of bioenergy production from DM and provided a general 
      overview for bioenergy production. Importantly, this paper discussed potentials
      of DM as candidate feedstocks not only for biogas, bioethanol, biohydrogen,
      microbial fuel cell, lactic acid, and fumaric acid production by microbial
      technology, but also for bio-oil and biochar production through apyrolysis
      process. Additionally, the use of manure for replacing freshwater or nutrients
      for algae cultivation and cellulase production were also discussed. Overall, DM
      could be a novel suitable material for future biorefinery. Importantly,
      considerable efforts and further extensive research on overcoming technical
      bottlenecks like pretreatment, the effective release of fermentable sugars, the
      absence of robust organisms for fermentation, energy balance, and life cycle
      assessment should be needed to develop a comprehensive biorefinery model.

AB  - Recently, the influence behavior of new pollutants in the environment has been
      widely concerned. However, the effect of antidepressants widely detected in
      excess sludge (ES) on biohydrogen production from anaerobic dark fermentation has
      never been explored. To fill this gap, fluoxetine (FLX), a typical
      antidepressant, was selected to evaluate its effect on ES mesophilic anaerobic
      dark biohydrogen fermentation. The results showed that FLX reduced biohydrogen
      production even at low content (0.1 mg/Kg). The biohydrogen yield was only 12.8
      mL/g in the 1.8 mg/Kg (based on total suspended solids) FLX group, decreased by
      about 34.7%, compared with the control group (without FLX). Further mechanism
      investigation implied that high levels (more than 0.6 mg/Kg) of FLX reduced every
      step associated with the biohydrogen production. FLX reduced the concentration of
      ammonia nitrogen and phosphate in fermentation broth. FLX also had a significant 
      negative effect on enzyme activity in ES dark fermentation.

AB  - This work investigates H2 production through aqueous phase reforming (APR) of
      synthetic brewery wastewater in a continuous fixed bed reactor with Pt and PtRe
      (3 wt %) catalysts supported on activated carbon. The influence of weight hourly 
      space velocity (WHSV) and superficial Ar gas flow velocity (VAr) was assessed for
      the sake of optimisation, while reaction temperature and pressure were maintained
      at 225 degrees C and 28 bar, respectively. H2 production was found to be higher
      using the PtRe catalyst at the lowest WHSV (0.03 h(-1)) and highest VAr (0.8 cm
      s(-1)). The comparison of the maximum H2 production obtained in this work (27.9
      mumol min(-1)) with other treatment processes shows the potential of the
      application of APR process for H2 production from brewery wastewater. Despite the
      different reaction conditions tested, the catalysts showed deactivation with time
      on stream, which was related to the formation of solid deposits on the surface of
      the catalysts. Therefore, future research should be related to the development of
      more stable catalysts, strategies that avoid deactivation by coking and
      regeneration processes.

AB  - Worldwide demand for ethanol alternative fuel has been emerging day by day owing 
      to the rapid population growth and industrialization. Culturing microalgae as an 
      alternative feedstock is anticipated to be a potentially significant approach for
      sustainable bioethanol biofuel production. Microalgae are abundant in nature,
      which grow at faster rates with a capability of storing high lipid and
      starch/cellulose contents inside their cells. This process offers several
      environmental advantages, including the effective utilization of land, good CO2
      sequestration without entering into "food against fuel" dispute. This chapter
      focuses on the methods and processes used for the production of bioethanol
      biofuels from algae. Thus, it also covers significant achievements in the
      research and developments on algae bioethanol production, mainly including
      pretreatment, hydrolysis, and fermentation of algae biomass. The processes of
      producing biodiesel, biogas, and hydrogen have also been discussed.

AB  - Annually, approximately 1.3 billion tons of food is lost worldwide, accounting
      for one-third of annual food production. Therefore, turning food waste into
      energy is of enormous environmental significance because of its sustainable
      nature. Nutrients and organic acids present in food waste can be used to produce 
      (bio)products such as biohydrogen through biological processes. However, our
      understanding of the production of biohydrogen from food waste through
      photofermentation and dark fermentation is still restricted. This comprehensive
      study aims to review the potential of food waste for biohydrogen production using
      microbial mediators, including a brief overview of process parameters that affect
      the (bio)hydrogen production pathway.

AB  - The complex nature of wastewater treatment has led to search for alternative
      strategies such as different artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to model the
      various operational parameters. The present work is aimed at predicting the
      transmembrane pressure (TMP) as a key operational parameter in the case of
      anaerobic membrane bioreactor-sequencing batch reactor (AnMBR-SBR) during
      biohydrogen production using the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS)
      and artificial neural network (ANN). In both the models, organic loading rates
      (OLR) ranging from 0.5 to 8.0 g COD/L/d, effluent pH (3.6-6.9), mixed liquor
      suspended solid (4.6-21.5 g/L) and mixed liquor volatile suspended solid
      (3.7-15.5 g/L) were used as the input parameters to test TMP as an output
      parameter. The ANFIS model was trained using the hybrid algorithms for TMP
      prediction. The higher prediction performance was obtained by using the Gauss
      membership function with four membership numbers. A back-propagation algorithm
      was also employed for the feed forward training of ANN model; the best structure 
      was a Levenberg-Marquardt training algorithm with nine neurons in the hidden
      layer. By employing ANFIS and ANN models, relatively a good prediction of TMP was
      obtained with the R(2) values of 0.93 and 0.88, respectively while the calculated
      mean square error for TMP in the ANFIS model (7.3 x 10(-3)) was lower than that
      of ANN model (8.02 x 10(-3)). The higher R(2) and lower MSE values for the ANFIS 
      model exhibited a better TMP prediction performance than the ANN model. Finally, 
      it was observed that in the sensitivity analysis of ANN model, OLR was the most
      important input parameter on the variation of TMP.

TI  - Semidry acid hydrolysis of cellulose sustained by autoclaving for production of
      reducing sugars for bacterial biohydrogen generation from various cellulose
      feedstock.
PG  - e11244
LID - 10.7717/peerj.11244 [doi]
AB  - Cellulosic biowastes are one of the cheapest and most abundant renewable organic 
      materials on earth that can be, subsequent to hydrolysis, utilized as an organic 
      carbon source for several fermentation biotechnologies. This study was devoted to
      explore a semidry acid hydrolysis of cellulose for decreasing the cost and ionic 
      strength of the hydrolysate. For semidry acid hydrolysis, cellulose was just
      wetted with HCl (0 to 7 M) and subjected to autoclaving. The optimum molar
      concentration of HCl and period of autoclaving for semidry acid hydrolysis of
      cellulose were 6 M and 50 min respectively. Subsequent to the semidry acid
      hydrolysis with a minimum volume of 6 M HCl sustained by autoclaving, the
      hydrolysate was diluted with distilled water and neutralized with NaOH (0.5 M).
      The reducing sugars produced from the semidry acid hydrolysis of cellulose was
      further used for dark fermentation biohydrogen production by Escherichia coli as 
      a representative of most hydrogen producing eubacteria which cannot utilize
      non-hydrolyzed cellulose. An isolated E. coli TFYM was used where this bacterium 
      was morphologically and biochemically characterized and further identified by
      phylogenetic 16S rRNA encoding gene sequence analysis. The reducing sugars
      produced by semidry acid hydrolysis could be efficiently utilized by E. coli
      producing 0.4 mol H2 mol(-1) hexose with a maximum rate of hydrogen gas
      production of 23.3 ml H2 h(-1) L(-1) and an estimated hydrogen yield of 20.5 (L
      H2 kg(-1) dry biomass). The cheap cellulosic biowastes of wheat bran, sawdust and
      sugarcane bagasse could be hydrolyzed by semidry acid hydrolysis where the
      estimated hydrogen yield per kg of its dry biomass were 36, 18 and 32 (L H2
      kg(-1) dry biomass) respectively indicating a good feasibility of hydrogen
      production from reducing sugars prepared by semidry acid hydrolysis of these
      cellulosic biowastes. Semidry acid hydrolysis could also be effectively used for 
      hydrolyzing non-cellulosic polysaccharides of dry cyanobacterial biomass. The
      described semidry acid hydrolysis of cellulosic biowastes in this study might be 
      applicable not only for bacterial biohydrogen production but also for various
      hydrolyzed cellulose-based fermentation biotechnologies.

TI  - Upcycling the Spent Mushroom Substrate of the Grey Oyster Mushroom Pleurotus
      pulmonarius as a Source of Lignocellulolytic Enzymes for Palm Oil Mill Effluent
      Hydrolysis.

AB  - Mushroom cultivation along with the palm oil industry in Malaysia have
      contributed to large volumes of accumulated lignocellulosic residues that cause
      serious environmental pollution when these agroresidues are burned. In this
      study, we illustrated the utilization of lignocellulolytic enzymes from the spent
      mushroom substrate of Pleurotus pulmonarius for the hydrolysis of palm oil mill
      effluent (POME). The hydrolysate was used for the production of biohydrogen gas
      and enzyme assays were carried out to determine the productivities/activities of 
      lignin peroxidase, laccase, xylanase, endoglucanase and beta-glucosidase in spent
      mushroom substrate. Further, the enzyme cocktails were concentrated for the
      hydrolysis of POME. Central composite design of response surface methodology was 
      performed to examine the effects of enzyme loading, incubation time and pH on the
      reducing sugar yield. Productivities of the enzymes for xylanase, laccase,
      endoglucanase, lignin peroxidase and beta-glucosidase were 2.3, 4.1, 14.6, 214.1,
      and 915.4 U g(-1), respectively. A maximum of 3.75 g/l of reducing sugar was
      obtained under optimized conditions of 15 h incubation time with 10% enzyme
      loading (v/v) at a pH of 4.8, which was consistent with the predicted reducing
      sugar concentration (3.76 g/l). The biohydrogen cumulative volume (302.78 ml
      H2.L(-1) POME) and 83.52% biohydrogen gas were recorded using batch fermentation 
      which indicated that the enzymes of spent mushroom substrate can be utilized for 
      hydrolysis of POME.

AB  - The role of anthraquinone-2-sulfonate (AQS) on biohydrogen production was
      explored in this study. The hydrogen molar yield (HMY) of the batch experiment
      with 0.2 mM AQS was not significantly improved comparing to that without AQS, but
      the acetate and ethanol yields were increased by 12.1% and 9.82%, respectively.
      According to the metabolites flux analysis, e(-) balance calculations and
      stoichiometry results, the biogenic anthrahydroquinone-2,6,-disulfonate (AH2QS)
      preferred to improve the H2 generation that catalyzed by hydrogenase, but not
      likely affect the H2 generation that through formate cleavage pathway (FCP).
      However, comparing to the mix culture without AQS, the hydrogen production rate
      and hydrogen yield were increased by 20.97% of 1.96%, respectively, in the
      presence of AQS. The results of this study provided better understanding of the
      role of AQS on biohydrogen production by the strain that follows FCP, and the
      synergistic biohydrogen production by the co-culture that follows FCP and
      butyrate/acetate pathway.

AB  - Photobiological hydrogen (H2) production is a promising renewable energy source. 
      HydA hydrogenases of green algae are efficient but O2-sensitive and compete for
      electrons with CO2-fixation. Recently, we established a photoautotrophic H2
      production system based on anaerobic induction, where the Calvin-Benson cycle is 
      inactive and O2 scavenged by an absorbent. Here, we employed thin layer cultures,
      resulting in a three-fold increase in H2 production relative to bulk CC-124
      cultures (50 microg chlorophyll/ml, 350 micromol photons m(-2) s(-1)).
      Productivity was maintained when increasing the light intensity to 1000 micromol 
      photons m(-2)s(-1) and the cell density to 150 microg chlorophyll/ml. Remarkably,
      the L159I-N230Y photosystem II mutant and the pgrl1 photosystem I cyclic electron
      transport mutant produced 50% more H2 than CC-124, while the pgr5 mutant
      generated 250% more (1.2 ml H2/ml culture in six days). The photosynthetic
      apparatus of the pgr5 mutant and its in vitro HydA activity remained remarkably
      stable.

AB  - Microbial stability and evolution are a critical aspect for biosensors,
      especially in detecting dynamic and emerging anaerobic biohythane production. In 
      this study, two upflow air-cathode chamber microbial fuel cells (UMFCs) were
      developed for in situ monitoring of the biohydrogen and biomethane reactors under
      a COD range of 1000-6000 mg/L and 150-1000 mg/L, respectively. Illumina MiSeq
      sequencing evidenced the dramatic shift of dominant microbial communities in
      UMFCs from hydrolytic and acidification bacteria (Clostridiaceae_1,
      Ruminococcaceae, Peptostreptococcaceae) to acetate-oxidizing bacteria
      (Synergistaceae, Dysgonomonadaceae, Spirochaetaceae). In addition,
      exoelectroactive bacteria evaluated from Enterobacteriaceae and Burkholderiaceae 
      to Desulfovibrionaceae and Propionibacteriaceae. Especially, Hydrogenotrophic
      methanogens (Methanobacteriaceae) were abundant at 93.41% in UMFC (for monitoring
      hydrogen reactor), which was speculated to be a major metabolic pathway for
      methane production. Principal component analysis revealed a similarity in
      microbial structure between UMFCs and methane bioreactors. Microbial network
      analysis suggested a more stable community structure of UMFCs with 205 days'
      operation.

LID - 10.1002/fsn3.2030 [doi]
AB  - In millennia, much attention has been paid toward agro-industrial waste which
      consists of lignin and cellulosic biomass. In this perspective, biomass waste
      which consists of lignocellulosic mass is an inexpensive, renewable, abundant
      that provides a unique natural resource for large-scale and cost-effective
      bioenergy collection. In this current scenario, efforts are directed to briefly
      review the agro-industrial lignocellulosic biomass as a broad spectrum of
      numerous functional ingredients, its utilization, and respective health benefits 
      with special to wheat straw. Wheat straw is lignocellulosic mass owing to the
      presence of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Its microbial culture is the
      most important and well adjusted, for a variety of applications in the
      fermentation substrate, feed, food, medicine, industry, and agriculture in order 
      to increase soil fertility. In industrial fermentation, wheat straw can be used
      as substrates for the production of a wide range of hydrolytic enzymes, drugs,
      metabolites, and other biofuels as a low-cost substrate or a natural source.
      Conclusively, wheat straw is the best source to produce bioethanol, biogas, and
      biohydrogen in biorefineries because it is a renewable, widely distributed, and
      easily available with very low cost, and its consumption is protected and
      environment friendly. Wheat straw is a moiety which has health benefits including
      anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, anti-artherogenic, anti-allergenic,
      antioxidant, antithrombotic, etc.

TI  - Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) production via resource recovery from industrial waste

AB  - The problem of waste generation in the form of wastewater and solid wastes has
      caused an urgent, yet persisting, global issue that calls for the development of 
      sustainable treatment and resource recovery technologies. The production of
      value-added polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) from industrial waste streams has
      attracted the attention of researchers and process industries because they could 
      replace traditional plastics. PHAs are biopolymers with high degradability, with 
      a variety of applications in the manufacturing sector (e.g. medical equipment,
      packaging). The aim of this review is to describe the techniques and industrial
      waste streams that are applied for PHA production. The different enrichment and
      accumulation techniques that employ mixed microbial communities and carbon
      recovery from industrial waste streams and various downstream processes were
      reviewed. PHA yields between 7.6 and 76 wt% were reported for pilot-scale PHA
      production; while, at the laboratory-scale, yields from PHA accumulation range
      between 8.6 and 56 wt%. The recent advances in the application of waste streams
      for PHA production could result in more widely spread PHA production at the
      industrial scale via its integration into biorefineries for co-generation of PHAs
      with other added-value products like biohydrogen and biogas.

AB  - Growing consumption of fossil reserves to meet the rising demand of energy has
      led to climate deterioration and simultaneous waste generation, urging modern
      society to find sustainable energy resource that can meet the growing energy
      demands and reduce greenhouse gas emissions and carbon footprints. In this
      aspect, hydrogen (H2) is one of the most promising sustainable clean fuels that
      has gained significant interest in recent years. This article highlights the
      major research progress on biohydrogen production from renewable bioresources
      such as organic wastes, lignocellulosic biomass, algal biomass, and industrial
      wastewaters. It summarizes the research highlights of manuscripts published in
      the special issue (VSI: ReBioH2-2020), which contains twenty-two articles,
      including seven critical reviews and fifteen research articles, focusing on
      biotechnological and thermochemical routes for biohydrogen production from
      renewable feedstocks. The major findings of the research works in this special
      issue can be used as a road-map for sustainable renewable hydrogen production
      from bioresources.

TI  - The Anaerobic Fungi: Challenges and Opportunities for Industrial Lignocellulosic 
      Biofuel Production.
LID - 694 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms9040694 [doi]
AB  - Lignocellulose is a promising feedstock for biofuel production as a renewable,
      carbohydrate-rich and globally abundant source of biomass. However, challenges
      faced include environmental and/or financial costs associated with typical
      lignocellulose pretreatments needed to overcome the natural recalcitrance of the 
      material before conversion to biofuel. Anaerobic fungi are a group of
      underexplored microorganisms belonging to the early diverging phylum
      Neocallimastigomycota and are native to the intricately evolved digestive system 
      of mammalian herbivores. Anaerobic fungi have promising potential for application
      in biofuel production processes due to the combination of their highly effective 
      ability to hydrolyse lignocellulose and capability to convert this substrate to
      H2 and ethanol. Furthermore, they can produce volatile fatty acid precursors for 
      subsequent biological conversion to H2 or CH4 by other microorganisms. The
      complex biological characteristics of their natural habitat are described, and
      these features are contextualised towards the development of suitable industrial 
      systems for in vitro growth. Moreover, progress towards achieving that goal is
      reviewed in terms of process and genetic engineering. In addition, emerging
      opportunities are presented for the use of anaerobic fungi for lignocellulose
      pretreatment; dark fermentation; bioethanol production; and the potential for
      integration with methanogenesis, microbial electrolysis cells and
      photofermentation.

AB  - Hydrogen gas is a clean-burning fuel suitable for powering public vehicles.
      Hydrogen fuel has the highest energy density (143 MJ kg(-1) ). This research
      paper emphasizes three-dimensional hydrodynamics and temperature distribution
      during photobiohydrogen generation by Rhodobacter sphaeroides strain O.U.001 in a
      triple-jacketed 1 L photobioreactor (PBR). The fermentation broth has turbulent
      flow conditions and light gradients among various layers, which affect the light 
      conversion efficiency of the PBR. From the carbon source (malic acid), various
      organic acids are produced within fermentation (lactate, acetate, and formate).
      Modeling and simulation studies by computational fluid dynamics confirmed uniform
      fluid dynamics and heat transfer throughout the annular PBR. The modified
      Gompertz equation gave good simulated fitting with an experimental value for H2
      generation. R. sphaeroides O.U. 001 gave good simulated results for H2 generation
      with mathematical modeling of substrate consumption kinetics and substrate
      utilization for biomass.

PG  - 641305
LID - 10.3389/fbioe.2021.641305 [doi]
AB  - Ferredoxins are metalloproteins that deliver electrons to several redox partners,
      including [FeFe] hydrogenases that are potentially a component of biological H2
      production technologies. Reduced ferredoxins can also lose electrons to molecular
      oxygen, which may lower the availability of electrons for cellular or synthetic
      reactions. Ferredoxins thus play a key role in diverse kinds of redox
      biochemistry, especially the enzymatic H2 production catalyzed by [FeFe]
      hydrogenases. We investigated how the yield of anaerobic and aerobic H2
      production vary among the four different types of ferredoxins that are used to
      deliver electrons extracted from NADPH within the synthetic, fermentative
      pathway. We also assessed the electron loss due to O2 reduction by reduced
      ferredoxins within the pathway, for which the difference was as high as
      five-fold. Our findings provide valuable insights for further improving
      biological H2 production technologies and can also facilitate elucidation of
      mechanisms governing interactions between Fe-S cluster(s) and molecular oxygen.

AB  - Herein, the advantages of enzyme mimetics by redefining the catalytic attributes 
      and implementing artificial enzymes (AEs) for energy-related applications have
      presented. The intrinsic enzyme-like catalytic characteristics of nanozymes have 
      become a growing area of prime interest in bio-catalysis. The development of AEs 
      has redefined the concept of catalytic activity, opening a wide range of
      possibilities in biotechnological and energy sectors. Nowadays, power-energy is
      one of the most valuable resources that enable the development and progress of
      humanity. Over the last 50 years, fossil fuels' burning has released greenhouse
      gases and negatively impacted the environment and health. In 2019, around 84% of 
      global primary energy came from coal, oil, and gas. Therefore, a global energy
      transition to renewable and sustainable energy is urgently needed to generate
      clean energy as biofuels and biohydrogen. However, to achieve this, the
      implementation of natural enzymes brings more significant challenges because
      their practical application is limited by the low operational stability, harsh
      environmental conditions, and expensive preparation processes. Hence, to
      accelerate the transition, promising substitutes are AEs, well-defined structures
      made of organic or inorganic materials that can mimic the catalytic power of
      natural enzymes. Despite being still in the midst, enzyme mimics overcome the
      main obstacles for a conventional enzyme. It opens future opportunities to
      optimize the production of renewable energies with excellent performance, high
      efficiency, and increasingly competitive prices. Thus, this work is a
      comprehensive study covering the promising potential of AEs, as biocatalysts,
      specifically for renewable energy production.

AB  - This study proposed a strategy to maximize the hydrogen yield by reusing
      feedstock of Arundo donax L. For this purpose, a successive 4-batch
      photo-fermentative hydrogen production (PFHP) was carried out to test the
      strategy. About 50% of total hydrogen yield was additionally obtained by reusing 
      the Arundo donax L for successive 4 times in comparison to single 1st batch
      (161.4 mL/U. cell dry weight). In addition to the highest hydrogen yield, the
      maximum hydrogen production rate (6.0 mL/U. cell dry weight /h), and the highest 
      volatile fatty acids (VFAs) concentration (32 mM) were also obtained from the 1st
      batch, while the 2nd batch gave the maximum substrate conversion efficiency
      (96.5%). Moreover, a positive relationship between the sum of acetic and butyric 
      acids with hydrogen yields was observed. This strategy would help in enhancing
      hydrogen yield that coupled with cost reduction for biohydrogen production.

AB  - In this work, nickel ferrite nanoparticles (NiFe2O4 NPs) was prepared to improve 
      hydrogen (H2) production by dark fermentation. Moderate amounts (50-200 mg/L)
      promoted H2 generation, while excess NiFe2O4 NPs (over 400 mg/L) lowered H2
      productivity. The highest H2 yields of 222 and 130 mL/g glucose were obtained in 
      the 100 mg/L (37 degrees C) and 200 mg/L NiFe2O4 NPs (55 degrees C) groups,
      respectively, and the values were 38.6% and 28.3% higher than those in the
      control groups (37 degrees C and 55 degrees C). Soluble metabolites showed that
      NiFe2O4 NPs enhanced the butyrate pathway, corresponding to the increased
      abundance of Clostridium butyricum in mesophilic fermentation. The endocytosis of
      NiFe2O4 NPs indicated that the released iron and nickel favored ferredoxin and
      hydrogenase synthesis and activity and that NiFe2O4 NPs could act as carriers in 
      intracellular electron transfer. The NPs also optimized microbial community
      structure and increased the levels of extracellular polymeric substances, leading
      to increased H2 production.

TI  - Fermentative molecular biohydrogen production from cheese whey: present prospects
      and future strategy.
PG  - 2297-2330
LID - 10.1007/s12010-021-03528-6 [doi]
AB  - Waste-dependent fermentative routes for biohydrogen production present a possible
      scenario to produce hydrogen gas on a large scale in a sustainable way. Cheese
      whey contains a high portion of organic carbohydrate and other organic acids,
      which makes it a feasible substrate for biohydrogen production. In the present
      review, recent research progress related to fermentative technologies, which
      explore the potentiality of cheese whey for biohydrogen production as an
      effective tool on a large scale, has been analyzed systematically. In addition,
      application of multiple response surface methodology tools such as full factorial
      design, Box-Behnken model, and central composite design during fermentative
      biohydrogen production to study the interactive effects of different bioprocess
      variables for higher biohydrogen yield in batch, fed-batch, and continuous mode
      is also discussed. The current paper also emphasizes computational fluid
      dynamics-based simulation designs, by which the substrate conversion efficiency
      of the cheese whey-based bioprocess and temperature distribution toward the
      turbulent flow of reaction liquid can be enhanced. The possible future
      developments toward higher process efficiency are outlined.

AB  - The availability of organic matters in vast quantities from the
      agricultural/industrial practices has long been a significant environmental
      challenge. These wastes have created global issues in increasing the levels of
      BOD or COD in water as well as in soil or air segments. Such wastes can be
      converted into bioenergy using a specific conversion platform in conjunction with
      the appropriate utilization of the methods such as anaerobic digestion, secondary
      waste treatment, or efficient hydrolytic breakdown as these can promote bioenergy
      production to mitigate the environmental issues. By the proper utilization of
      waste organics and by adopting innovative approaches, one can develop bioenergy
      processes to meet the energy needs of the society. Waste organic matters from
      plant origins or other agro-sources, biopolymers, or complex organic matters
      (cellulose, hemicelluloses, non-consumable starches or proteins) can be used as
      cheap raw carbon resources to produce biofuels or biogases to fulfill the ever
      increasing energy demands. Attempts have been made for bioenergy production by
      biosynthesizing, methanol, n-butanol, ethanol, algal biodiesel, and biohydrogen
      using different types of organic matters via biotechnological/chemical routes to 
      meet the world's energy need by producing least amount of toxic gases (reduction 
      up to 20-70% in concentration) in order to promote sustainable green
      environmental growth. This review emphasizes on the nature of available wastes,
      different strategies for its breakdown or hydrolysis, efficient microbial
      systems. Some representative examples of biomasses source that are used for
      bioenergy production by providing critical information are discussed.
      Furthermore, bioenergy production from the plant-based organic matters and
      environmental issues are also discussed. Advanced biofuels from the organic
      matters are discussed with efficient microbial and chemical processes for the
      promotion of biofuel production from the utilization of plant biomasses.

PG  - 5601-5608
LID - 10.1039/d0ra09290h [doi]
AB  - Three anaerobic packed bed reactors (APBR) packed with activated carbon,
      maifanite and tourmaline as support material were continuously operated for 165
      days to generate hydrogen from traditional Chinese medicine wastewater at
      different organic loading rates (OLR) from 15.2 to 91.3 g COD L(-1) d(-1) by
      changes of hydraulic retention time (HRT) varying from 24 to 6 h. The best
      performance with hydrogen production rate (HPR) of 7.92 +/- 0.27 mmol L(-1) h(-1)
      and hydrogen yield (HY) of 3.50 +/- 0.09 mmol g(-1) COD was achieved for the
      reactor with tourmaline at OLR of 60.8 g COD L(-1) d(-1) (HRT = 6 h), followed by
      activated carbon and maifanite. The main metabolic products for each reactor were
      found to be acetate and butyrate in the effluent with pH range of 5.6-6.4 and
      microbial analysis revealed that the dominant communities in all cultures were C.
      carboxidivoran and C. butyricum, responsible for acetate and butyrate production 
      respectively.

AB  - Biowaste management is a challenging job as it is high in nutrient content and
      its disposal in open may cause a serious environmental and health risk.
      Traditional technologies such as landfill, bio-composting, and incineration are
      used for biowaste management. To gain revenue from biowaste researchers around
      the world focusing on the integration of biowaste management with other
      commercial products such as volatile fatty acids (VFA), biohydrogen, and
      bioplastic (polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA)), etc. PHA production from various
      biowastes such as lignocellulosic biomass, municipal waste, waste cooking oils,
      biodiesel industry waste, and syngas has been reported successfully. Various
      nutrient factors i.e., carbon and nitrogen source concentration and availability 
      of dissolved oxygen are crucial factors for PHA production. This review is an
      attempt to summarize the recent advancements in PHA production from various
      biowaste, its downstream processing, and other challenges that need to overcome
      making bioplastic an alternate for synthetic plastic.

AB  - Sustainable development of circular bioeconomy concept is only possible upon
      adopting potential advanced technologies for food waste valorization. This
      approach can simultaneously answer resources and environmental challenges
      incurred due to capital loss and greenhouse gases accumulation. Food waste
      valorization opens new horizons of economical growth, bringing waste as an
      opportunity feedstock for bio processes to synthesize biobased products from
      biological source in a circular loop. Advanced technologies like Ultrasound
      assisted extraction, Microwave assisted extraction, bioreactors, enzyme
      immobilization assisted extraction and their combination mitigates the global
      concern caused due to mismanagement of food waste. Food waste decomposition to
      sub-zero level using advanced techniques fabricates food waste into bio-based
      products like bioactive compounds (antioxidants, pigments, polysaccharides,
      polyphenols, etc.); biofuels (biodiesel, biomethane, biohydrogen); and
      bioplastics. This review abridges merits and demerits of various advanced
      techniques extended for food waste valorization and contribution of food waste in
      revenue generation as value added products.

TI  - Dynamics and Complexity of Dark Fermentation Microbial Communities Producing
      Hydrogen From Sugar Beet Molasses in Continuously Operating Packed Bed Reactors.
PG  - 612344
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2020.612344 [doi]
AB  - This study describes the dynamics and complexity of microbial communities
      producing hydrogen-rich fermentation gas from sugar-beet molasses in five
      packed-bed reactors (PBRs). The bioreactors constitute a part of a system
      producing hydrogen from the by-products of the sugar-beet industry that has been 
      operating continuously in one of the Polish sugar factories. PBRs with different 
      working volumes, packing materials, construction and inocula were tested. This
      study focused on analysis (based on 16S rRNA profiling and shotgun metagenomics
      sequencing) of the microbial communities selected in the PBRs under the
      conditions of high (>100 cm(3)/g COD of molasses) and low (<50 cm(3)/g COD of
      molasses) efficiencies of hydrogen production. The stability and efficiency of
      the hydrogen production are determined by the composition of dark fermentation
      microbial communities. The most striking difference between the tested samples is
      the ratio of hydrogen producers to lactic acid bacteria. The highest efficiency
      of hydrogen production (130-160 cm(3)/g COD of molasses) was achieved at the
      ratios of HPB to LAB approximately 4:2.5 or 2.5:1 as determined by 16S rRNA
      sequencing or shotgun metagenomics sequencing, respectively. The most abundant
      Clostridium species were C. pasteurianum and C. tyrobutyricum. A multiple
      predominance of LAB over HPB (3:1-4:1) or clostridia over LAB (5:1-60:1) results 
      in decreased hydrogen production. Inhibition of hydrogen production was
      illustrated by overproduction of short chain fatty acids and ethanol.
      Furthermore, concentration of ethanol might be a relevant marker or factor
      promoting a metabolic shift in the DF bioreactors processing carbohydrates from
      hydrogen-yielding toward lactic acid fermentation or solventogenic pathways. The 
      novelty of this study is identifying a community balance between hydrogen
      producers and lactic acid bacteria for stable hydrogen producing systems. The
      balance stems from long-term selection of hydrogen-producing microbial community,
      operating conditions such as bioreactor construction, packing material, hydraulic
      retention time and substrate concentration. This finding is confirmed by
      additional analysis of the proportions between HPB and LAB in dark fermentation
      bioreactors from other studies. The results contribute to the advance of
      knowledge in the area of relationships and nutritional interactions especially
      the cross-feeding of lactate between bacteria in dark fermentation microbial
      communities.

      Using Alginate Beads.
PG  - 1558-1573
LID - 10.1007/s12010-021-03503-1 [doi]
AB  - Biological hydrogen (H2) is a promising candidate for production of renewable
      hydrogen. Using entrapped cells rather than conventional suspended cell cultures 
      for the production of H2 offers several advantages, such as improved production
      yields related to higher cell density, and enhanced resistance to substrate and
      end-product inhibition. In this study, H2 production by a novel isolate of
      Clostridium intestinale (strain URNW) was evaluated using cells entrapped within 
      2% calcium-alginate beads under strictly anaerobic conditions. Both immobilized
      cells and suspended cultures were studied in sequential batch-mode anaerobic
      fermentation over 192 h. The production of H2 in the headspace was examined for
      four different initial cellobiose concentrations (5, 10, 20, and 40 mM). Although
      a lag period for initiation of the fermentation process was observed for bacteria
      entrapped within hydrogel beads, the immobilized cells achieved both higher
      volumetric production rates (mmol H2/(L culture h)) and molar yields (mol H2/mol 
      glucose equivalent) of H2 compared with suspended cultures. In the current study,
      the maximum cellobiose consumption rate of 0.40 mM/h, corresponding to 133.3
      mg/(L h), was achieved after 72 h of fermentation by immobilized cells,
      generating a high hydrogen yield of 3.57 mol H2/mol cellobiose, whereas suspended
      cultures only yielded 1.77 mol H2/mol cellobiose. The results suggest that cells 
      remain viable within the hydrogels and proliferated with a slow rate over the
      course of fermentation. The stable productivity of immobilized cells over 8 days 
      with four changes of medium depicted that the immobilized cells of the isolated
      strain can successfully yield higher hydrogen and lower soluble metabolites than 
      suspended cells suggesting a feasible process for future applications for bioH2
      production.

AB  - Dark fermentation (DF) is one of the most promising biological methods to produce
      bio-hydrogen and other value added bio-products from carbohydrate-rich wastes and
      wastewater. However, process instability and low hydrogen production yields and
      rates have been highlighted as the major bottlenecks preventing further
      development. Numerous studies have associated such concerns with the inhibitory
      activity of lactate-producing bacteria (LAB) against hydrogen producers. However,
      an increasing number of studies have also shown lactate-based metabolic pathways 
      as the prevailing platform for hydrogen production. This opens a vast potential
      to develop new strategies to deal with the "Achilles heel" of DF - LAB overgrowth
      - while untapping high-performance DF. This review discusses the key factors
      influencing the lactate-driven hydrogen production, paying particular attention
      to substrate composition, the operating conditions, as well as the microbiota
      involved in the process and its potential functionality and related biochemical
      routes. The current limitations and future perspectives in the field are also
      presented.

AB  - This review explores the sustainable feasibility of kitchen wastes to implement
      as an effective substrate for biohydrogen production through dark fermentation.
      Being organic in nature, kitchen wastes are enomerous source of nutrients and
      carbohydrate, which are produced in huge quantity in our daily life, and
      therefore can be potentially used for biohydrogen production through microbial
      technique. The review discussed in detail about the impact of kitchen waste, its 
      availability and sustainability on the biohydrogen production process along with 
      future scope at industrial scale for the production of sustainable and renewable 
      energy. In addition, recent advances, and their possibility to enhance the
      fermentative biohydrogen production using kitchen waste have been covered.
      Emphasis is also made on the application of nanomaterials to increase the yield
      of biohydrogen production and to make the entire process more economical and
      sustainable while using kitchen wastes as substrate for the microbial
      fermentation. Finally, advantages, limitations and future prospects of the
      process of biohydrogen production using kitchen wastes as potential substrate
      have been discussed.

AB  - The aim of this work was to study the characteristics, kinetics and electronic
      distribution of photo-fermentation hydrogen production (PFHP) with Zn(2+)
      addition then gave the main results that the addition of Zn(2+) can effectively
      improve hydrogen production with an increasing of 1-5 mg/L Zn(2+) concentration. 
      The maximum hydrogen yield of 592 +/- 13 mL and shortest lag time of 4.67 h were 
      obtained at 2 mg/L Zn(2+). 26.42% of the substrate energy was diverted to H2.
      Modified Gompertz and Hane-Levenspiel models were applied to evaluate the effect 
      of Zn(2+) on PFHP by mixed bacteria HAU-M1, the constants n and m obtained by
      fitting models were 14.97 and 58.79, respectively, indicating the fermentation
      system was noncompetitive inhibition, the predicted critical Zn(2+) concentration
      was 40.83 mg/L.

PG  - 621166

AB  - Currently one of the biggest challenges for society is to combat global warming. 
      A solution to this global threat is the implementation of a CO2-based bioeconomy 
      and a H2-based bioenergy economy. Anaerobic lithotrophic bacteria such as the
      acetogenic bacteria are key players in the global carbon and H2 cycle and thus
      prime candidates as driving forces in a H2- and CO2-bioeconomy. Naturally, they
      convert two molecules of CO2 via the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway (WLP) to one molecule
      of acetyl-CoA which can be converted to different C2-products (acetate or
      ethanol) or elongated to C4 (butyrate) or C5-products (caproate). Since there is 
      no net ATP generation from acetate formation, an electron-transport
      phosphorylation (ETP) module is hooked up to the WLP. ETP provides the cell with 
      additional ATP, but the ATP gain is very low, only a fraction of an ATP per mol
      of acetate. Since acetogens live at the thermodynamic edge of life, metabolic
      engineering to obtain high-value products is currently limited by the low energy 
      status of the cells that allows for the production of only a few compounds with
      rather low specificity. To set the stage for acetogens as production platforms
      for a wide range of bioproducts from CO2, the energetic barriers have to be
      overcome. This review summarizes the pathway, the energetics of the pathway and
      describes ways to overcome energetic barriers in acetogenic C1 conversion.

AB  - Algae are one of the most viable feedstock options that can be converted into
      different bioenergies viz., bioethanol, biobutanol, biodiesel, biomethane,
      biohydrogen, etc. owing to their renewable, sustainable and economic credibility 
      features. Algal biomass to fuel biorefining process is generally classified into 
      three categories as chemical, biochemical and thermochemical methods. The present
      article aims to provide a state-of-the-art review on the factors affecting the
      thermochemical conversion process of algal biomass to bioenergy. Further,
      reaction conditions of each techniques (torrefaction, pyrolysis, gasification and
      hydrothermal process) influence biochar, bio-oil and syngas yield were discussed.
      Reaction parameters or factors such as reactor temperature, residence time,
      pressure, biomass load/feedstock composition, catalyst addition and carrier gas
      flow affecting process efficiency in terms of product yield and quality were
      spotlighted and extensively discussed with copious literature. It also presents
      the novel insights on production of solid (char), liquid (bio-oil) and gaseous
      (syngas) biofuel through torrefaction, pyrolysis and gasification, respectively. 
      It is found that the energy intensive drying was more efficient mode involved in 
      thermochemical process for wet algal biomass. However other modes of
      thermochemical process were having unique feature on improving the product yield 
      and quality. Among the various factors, reaction temperature and residence time
      were relatively more important factors which affected the process efficiency. The
      other factors signposted in this review will lay a roadmap to researchers to
      choose an optimal thermochemical conditions for high quality end product. Lastly,
      the perspectives and challenges in thermochemical conversion algae biomass to
      biofuels were also discussed.

AB  - The issues of global warming, coupled with fossil fuel depletion, have

      search for renewable fuels has motivated research into the biological degradation
      of lignocellulosic biomass feedstock to produce biofuels such as bioethanol,
      biodiesel, and biohydrogen. The model strain for biofuel production needs the
      capability to utilize a high amount of substrate, transportation of sugar through
      fast and deregulated pathways, ability to tolerate inhibitory compounds and end
      products, and increased metabolic fluxes to produce an improved fermentation
      product. Engineering microbes might be a great approach to produce biofuel from
      lignocellulosic biomass by exploiting metabolic pathways economically. Metabolic 
      engineering is an advanced technology for the construction of highly effective
      microbial cell factories and a key component for the next-generation bioeconomy. 
      It has been extensively used to redirect the biosynthetic pathway to produce
      desired products in several native or engineered hosts. A wide range of novel
      compounds has been manufactured through engineering metabolic pathways or
      endogenous metabolism optimizations by metabolic engineers. This review is
      focused on the potential utilization of engineered strains to produce biofuel and
      gives prospects for improvement in metabolic engineering for new strain
      development using advanced technologies.

AB  - Biohydrogen is a clean and renewable source of energy. It can be produced by
      using technologies such as thermochemical, electrolysis, photoelectrochemical and
      biological, etc. Among these technologies, the biological method (dark
      fermentation) is considered more sustainable and ecofriendly. Dark fermentation
      involves anaerobic microbes which degrade carbohydrate rich substrate and produce
      hydrogen. Lignocellulosic biomass is an abundantly available raw material and can
      be utilized as an economic and renewable substrate for biohydrogen production.
      Although there are many hurdles, continuous advancements in lignocellulosic
      biomass pretreatment technology, microbial fermentation (mixed substrate and
      co-culture fermentation), the involvement of molecular biology techniques, and
      understanding of various factors (pH, T, addition of nanomaterials) effect on
      biohydrogen productivity and yield render this technology efficient and capable
      to meet future energy demands. Further integration of biohydrogen production
      technology with other products such as bio-alcohol, volatile fatty acids (VFAs), 
      and methane have the potential to improve the efficiency and economics of the
      overall process. In this article, various methods used for lignocellulosic
      biomass pretreatment, technologies in trends to produce and improve biohydrogen
      production, a coproduction of other energy resources, and techno-economic
      analysis of biohydrogen production from lignocellulosic biomass are reviewed.

AB  - Global increase in demand for food supply has resulted in surplus generation of
      wastes. What was once considered wastes, has now become a resource. Studies were 
      carried out on the conversion of biowastes into wealth using methods such as
      extraction, incineration and microbial intervention. Agro-industry biowastes are 
      promising sources of carbon for microbial fermentation to be transformed into
      value-added products. In the era of circular economy, the goal is to establish an
      economic system which aims to eliminate waste and ensure continual use of
      resources in a close-loop cycle. Biowaste collection is technically and
      economically practicable, hence it serves as a renewable carbon feedstock.
      Biowastes are commonly biotransformed into value-added materials such as
      bioethanol, bioplastics, biofuels, biohydrogen, biobutanol and biogas. This
      review reveals the recent developments on microbial transformation of biowastes
      into biotechnologically important products. This approach addresses measures
      taken globally to valorize waste to achieve low carbon economy. The sustainable
      use of these renewable resources is a positive approach towards waste management 
      and promoting circular economy.

AB  - Over the last decade the world has been generating a high quantity of tangerine
      peel waste (TPW), pomegranate peel waste (PPW) and banana peel waste (BPW). These
      peels have several economic benefits but there is mismanagement or inappropriate 
      valorisation that could present risks to environment and public health. In the
      current review, we discussed the use of TPW, PPW and BPW directly for animal
      feed, soil fertilization, specific compost production and bio-adsorbent. We also 
      discussed the valorisation of these peels for manufacturing the value-added
      products including enzymes, essential oil and other products that can be used in 
      human food, in medical and cosmetic industry. Additionally, recent studies
      concerning the valorisation of these peels by biorefinery for bioethanol, biogas 
      and biohydrogen production have been discussed. In the same context some other
      recent studies about valorisation of microorganisms isolated from these peels for
      medical, agronomic and industrial interests have been also discussed.

AB  - Third generation biomass, i.e. microalgae, has emerged as a promising alternative
      to first and second generation biomass for biohydrogen production. However, its
      utilization is still low at present, due to several reasons including the strong 
      and rigidity of the microalgal cell wall that limit the hydrolysis efficiency
      during dark fermentation (DF) and photofermentation (PF) processes. To improve
      the utilization efficiency of microalgal biomass, it is crucial that important
      aspects related to the production of the biomass and the following processes are 
      elaborated. Thus, this article provides detailed overview of algal strains,
      cultivation, and harvesting. It also presents recent research and detailed
      information on microalgal biomass pretreatment, and biohydrogen production
      through DF, PF, and co-digestion of microalgal biomass with organic materials.
      Furthermore, factors affecting fermentation processes performance and the use of 
      molecular techniques in biohydrogen production are presented. This review also
      discusses challenges and future prospects towards biohydrogen production from
      microalgal biomass.

AB  - Ethanol-type fermentation (ETF) is one of three fermentation types during the
      acidogenesis of the anaerobic biological treatment. Ethanoligenens, a
      representative genus of ETF, displays acidophilic, autoaggregative, and
      ethanol-H2 co-producing characteristics and facilitates subsequent
      methanogenesis. Here, the latest advances in the molecular mechanisms of the
      metabolic regulation of ethanol-H2 co-producing bacteria based on multi-omics
      studies were comprehensively reviewed. Comparative genomics demonstrated a low
      genetic similarity between Ethanoligenens and other hydrogen-producing genera.
      FeFehydrogenases (FeFe-H2ases) and pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR)
      played critical roles in the ethanol-H2 co-metabolic pathway of Ethanoligenens.
      Global transcriptome analysis revealed that highly expressed [FeFe]-H2ases and
      ferredoxins drove hydrogen production by Ethanoligenens at low pH conditions
      (4.0-4.5). Quantitative proteomic analysis also proved that this genus resists
      acetic acid-induced intracellular acidification through the up-regulated
      expression of pyrimidine metabolism related proteins. The autoaggregation of
      Ethanoligenen facilitated its granulation with acetate-oxidizing bacteria in
      co-culture systems and mitigated a fast pH drop, providing a new approach for
      solving a pH imbalance and improving hydrogen production. In-depth studies of the
      regulatory mechanism underlying ethanol-H2 co-production metabolism and the
      syntrophic interactions of ethanol-H2 co-producing Ethanoligenens with other
      microorganisms will provide insights into the improvement of bioenergy recovery
      in anaerobic biotechnology. The coupling of ETF with other biotechnologies, which
      based on the regulation of electron flow direction, syntrophic interaction, and
      metabolic flux, can be potential strategies to enhance the cascade recovery of
      energy and resources.

AB  - Global urbanization has resulted in amplified energy and material consumption
      with simultaneous waste generation. Current energy demand is mostly fulfilled by 
      finite fossil reserves, which has critical impact on the environment and thus,
      there is a need for carbon-neutral energy. In this view, biohydrogen (bio-H2) is 
      considered suitable due to its potential as a green and dependable carbon-neutral
      energy source in the emerging 'Hydrogen Economy'. Bio-H2 production by dark
      fermentation of biowaste/biomass/wastewater is gaining significant attention.
      However, bio-H2production still holds critical challenges towards scale-up with
      reference to process limitations and economic viabilities. This review
      illustrates the status of dark-fermentation process in the context of process
      sustainability and achieving commercial success. The review also provides an
      insight on various process integrations for maximum resource recovery including
      closed loop biorefinery approach towards the accomplishment of carbon neutral H2 
      production.

AB  - Archaea are a domain of prokaryotic organisms with intriguing physiological
      characteristics and ecological importance. In Microbial Biotechnology, archaea
      are historically overshadowed by bacteria and eukaryotes in terms of public
      awareness, industrial application, and scientific studies, although their
      biochemical and physiological properties show a vast potential for a wide range
      of biotechnological applications. Today, the majority of microbial cell factories
      utilized for the production of value-added and high value compounds on an
      industrial scale are bacterial, fungal or algae based. Nevertheless, archaea are 
      becoming ever more relevant for biotechnology as their cultivation and genetic
      systems improve. Some of the main advantages of archaeal cell factories are the
      ability to cultivate many of these often extremophilic organisms under
      non-sterile conditions, and to utilize inexpensive feedstocks often toxic to
      other microorganisms, thus drastically reducing cultivation costs. Currently, the
      only commercially available products of archaeal cell factories are
      bacterioruberin, squalene, bacteriorhodopsin and diether-/tetraether-lipids, all 
      of which are produced utilizing halophiles. Other archaeal products, such as
      carotenoids and biohydrogen, as well as polyhydroxyalkanoates and methane are in 
      early to advanced development stages, respectively. The aim of this review is to 
      provide an overview of the current state of Archaea Biotechnology by describing
      the actual state of research and development as well as the industrial
      utilization of archaeal cell factories, their role and their potential in the
      future of sustainable bioprocessing, and to illustrate their physiological and
      biotechnological potential.

AB  - This study highlights biohydrogen production enrichment through NiO and CoO
      nanoparticles (NPs) inclusion to dark fermentation of rice mill wastewater using 
      Clostridium beijerinckii DSM 791. NiO (~26 nm) and CoO (~50 nm) NPs were
      intrinsically prepared via facile hydrothermal method with polyhedral morphology 
      and high purity. Dosage dependency studies revealed the maximum biohydrogen
      production characteristics for 1.5 mg/L concentration of both NPs. Biohydrogen
      yield was improved by 2.09 and 1.9 folds higher for optimum dosage of NiO and CoO
      respectively, compared to control run without NPs. Co-metabolites analysis
      confirmed the biohydrogen production through acetate and butyrate pathways.
      Maximum COD reduction efficiencies of 77.6% and 69.5% were observed for NiO and
      CoO inclusions respectively, which were higher than control run (57.5%). Gompertz
      kinetic model fitted well with experimental data of NPs assisted fermentation.
      Thus, NiO and CoO inclusions to wastewater fermentation seems to be a promising
      technique for augmented biohydrogen production.

AB  - Biohydrogen production and integration possibilities are vital towards hydrogen
      economy and sustainability of the environment. Acidogenic fermentation is
      acquiring great interest and it is one of the prime pathways to produce
      biohydrogen and short chain carboxylic acids. In addition to hydrogen recovery,
      simultaneously nearly 60 percent of the organics may get converted to ethanol,
      1,3propanediol and organic acids. Besides, these organics (fermentative
      effluents) can be used indirectly as a raw material for the generation of value- 
      added products such as biolipid, polyhydroxyalkanoates, excess hydrogen, methane 
      and electrical energy recovery. In this regard, this review has been assessed as 
      a valuable biorefinery for biofuel and value- added products recovery. The
      biorefinery can be used to minimize entire cost of the approach by obtaining
      extra profits.

TI  - Influence of initial uncontrolled pH on acidogenic fermentation of brewery spent

AB  - This two-phase, two-stage study analyzed production of biohydrogen and volatile
      fatty acids by acidogenic fermentation of brewery spent grains. Phase-1 served to
      optimize the effect of pH (4-10) on acidogenic fermentation; whereas phase-2
      validated the optimized conditions by scaling up the process to 2 L, 5 L, and 10 
      L. Alkaline conditions (pH 9) yielded excellent cumulative H2 production (834 mL)
      and volatile fatty acid recovery (8936 mg/L) in phase-1. Extended fermentation
      time (from 5 to 10 days) upgraded the accumulated short-chain fatty acids (C2-C4)
      to medium-chain fatty acids (C5-C6). Enrichment for acidogens in modified mixed
      culture improved fatty acid production; while their consumption by methanogens in
      unmodified culture led to methane formation. Increased CH4 but decreased H2
      content enabled biohythane generation. Scaling up confirmed the role of pH and
      culture type in production of renewable fuels and platform molecules from brewery
      spent grains.

AB  - Complex organic substrates represent an important and relevant feedstock for
      producing hydrogen by Dark Fermentation (DF). Usually, an external microbial
      inoculum originated from various natural environments is added to seed the DF
      reactors. However, H2 yields are significantly impacted by the inoculum origin
      and the storage conditions as microbial community composition can fluctuate. This
      study aims to determine how the type and time of inoculum storage can impact the 
      DF performances. Biochemical Hydrogen Potential tests were carried out using
      three substrates (glucose, the organic fraction of municipal solid waste, and
      food waste), inocula of three different origins, different storage conditions
      (freezing or freeze-drying) and duration. As a result, H2 production from glucose
      with the differently stored inocula was significantly impacted (positively or
      negatively) and was inoculum-origin-dependent. For complex substrates, hydrogen
      yields with the stored inocula were not statistically different from the fresh
      inocula, offering the possibility to store an inoculum.

AB  - In this study, we describe the development of a hybrid bioreactor with integrated
      chlorinated polyethylene (CPE) fixed-bed and zeolite as a microorganism nutrition
      carrier (MNC), aiming at enhancing and sustaining biohydrogen production during
      the anaerobic digestion (AD) process. In the batch test, the hybrid bioreactor
      achieved a maximum biohydrogen production of 646.3 mL/L. Accordingly, the hybrid 
      bioreactor significantly enhanced biohydrogen production and maintained a stable 
      performance for 50 days of semi-continuous operation. This result should be
      attributed to the CPE providing roughness surface and high porosity for
      microorganism immobilization, resulting in the enhancement of microbial quantity,
      confirmed by our scanning electron microscope and immobilized biomass analyses.
      Moreover, the element ratio significantly decreased, indicating that zeolite
      could provide metal cations for stimulating microbial bioactivity and growth, as 
      well as contributing to superior biohydrogen productivity during the 50-day
      operation. In order to further enhance and sustain long-term biohydrogen
      production, raw zeolite was modified with iron. The hybrid-Fe bioreactor (CPE
      with Fe-modified zeolite) operated mainly following the acetate pathway and
      exhibited higher sustainability in improving biohydrogen production with a peak
      value of 1893.0 mL/L during a 72-day-lasting operation. The synergistic mechanism
      of the Fe-modified zeolite and CPE fixed-bed revealed that it could effectively
      induce favorable pathways and contribute to the synthesis of essential enzymes,
      micronutrient supplementation, electoral conductivity, and microbial
      immobilization for biohydrogen production. Therefore, a hybrid-Fe bioreactor
      could provide a unique alternative for the enhancement of hydrogen production for
      practical applications.

AB  - The imprudent use of fossil fuels has resulted in high greenhouse gas (GHG)
      emissions, leading to climate change and global warming. Reduction in GHG
      emissions and energy insecurity imposed by the depleting fossil fuel reserves led
      to the search for alternative sustainable fuels. Hydrogen is a potential
      alternative energy carrier and is of particular interest because hydrogen
      combustion releases only water. Hydrogen is also an important industrial
      feedstock. As an alternative energy carrier, hydrogen can be used in fuel cells
      for power generation. Current hydrogen production mainly relies on fossil fuels
      and is usually energy and CO2 -emission intensive, thus the use of fossil
      fuel-derived hydrogen as a carbon-free fuel source is fallacious. Biohydrogen
      production can be achieved via microbial methods, and the use of microalgae for
      hydrogen production is outstanding due to the carbon mitigating effects and the
      utilization of solar energy as an energy source by microalgae. This review
      provides comprehensive information on the mechanisms of hydrogen production by
      microalgae and the enzymes involved. The major challenges in the
      commercialization of microalgae-based photobiological hydrogen production are
      critically analyzed and future research perspectives are discussed. Life cycle
      analysis and economic assessment of hydrogen production by microalgae are also
      presented.

AB  - The use of effluents for hydrogen production through dark fermentation is
      promising because it results in the generation of value-added products and
      reduction of the effluent's organic load. A low-cost medium using agroindustrial 
      effluents, corn steep liquor (CSL) and cassava processing wastewater (CPW) was
      evaluated for hydrogen production with microbial consortia (Vir and Gal). Four
      variables were evaluated for their impact on biohydrogen production through a
      Plackett Burman design. Subsequently, the significant variables were optimized
      using a central composite design, resulting in two mathematical models with
      regression coefficients R(2) > 0.92. The maximum yields were validated and
      resulted in 107 and 83.1 mL of biohydrogen/g COD removed for Vir and Gal,
      respectively. The lower medium cost for biohydrogen production was 81.5 USD/m(3),
      approximately 80% more economical than some supplemented media. Finally, the
      scale-up of the biohydrogen production by consortia to 5L resulted in an increase
      of more than 40%.

AB  - Steam and air gasification with 5 wt% Ni/Al2O3 eggshell (Ni-EG) and homo (Ni-H)
      catalysts were performed for the first time to produce biohydrogen from food
      waste. The steam gasification produced comparably higher gas yield than air
      gasification. In non-catalytic experiments, steam gasification generated a higher
      volume percent of H2, whereas more CO, CO2, CH4, and C2-C4 were produced in air
      gasification. Ni-EG demonstrated higher potential to obtain H2-rich gases with a 
      low C2-C4 content compared to that obtained by Ni-H, particularly in steam
      gasification at 800 degrees C, which produced gaseous products with 59.48 vol%
      H2. The long-term activity of both catalysts in steam gasification was evaluated,
      and Ni-EG exhibited higher stability than Ni-H. The ideal distribution of Ni
      species on the outer region of gamma-Al2O3 pellets in Ni-EG resulted in higher
      activity, stability, and selectivity than Ni-H in both steam and air
      gasification.

AB  - Microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) technology is a promising bioelectrochemical
      hydrogen production technology that utilizes anodic bio-catalytic oxidation and
      cathodic reduction processes. MECs require a lower external energy input than
      water electrolysis; however, as they also require the application of external
      power sources, this inevitably renders MEC systems a less sustainable option.
      This issue is the main obstacle hindering the practical application of MECs.
      Therefore, this review aims to introduce a self-sustainable MEC technology by
      combining conventional MECs with advanced carbon-neutral technologies, such as
      solar-, microbial-, osmotic-, and thermoelectric-powers (and their combinations).
      Moreover, new approaches to overcome the thermodynamic barriers and attain
      self-sustaining MECs are discussed in detail, thereby providing a working
      principle, current challenges, and future perspective in the field. This review
      provides comprehensive insights into reliable hydrogen production as well as the 
      latest trends towards self-sustainable MECs for practical application.

TI  - Unexpected high production of biohydrogen from the endogenous fermentation of
      grape must deposits.

AB  - The aim of this work was to assess the performances of wine byproduct biomass for
      hydrogen production by dark fermentation. Grape must deposits from two grape
      varieties (Pinot Gris and Chardonnay) were considered, either with external
      microbial inoculum or without. We show that grape must residues contain
      endogenous microflora, well adapted to their environment, which can degrade
      sugars (initially contained in the biomass) to hydrogen without any nutrient
      addition. Indeed, hydrogen production during endogenous fermentation is as
      efficient as with an external heat-treated inoculum (2.5 +/- 0.4 LH2.L(-1)reactor
      and 1.61 +/- 0.41 molH2.mol(-1)consumed hexose, respectively) with a lower energy
      cost. Hydrogen-producing bacteria were selected from the endogenous microflora
      during semi-batch bioreactor operation, as shown by T-RFLP profiles and 16S rRNA 
      sequencing, with Clostridium spp. (butyricum, beijerinckii, diolis, roseum)
      identified as the major phylotype. Such hydrogen production efficiency opens new 
      perspectives for innovating in the valorization of winery by-products.

AB  - The reliance of fossil fuel for industrial and energy sectors has resulted in its
      depletion. Therefore, enormous efforts have been considered to move-out from
      fossil fuels to renewable energy sources based industrial process developments.
      Recently, biohydrogen (bio-H2) has been recognised as a clean source of fuel with
      high-energy efficiency, which can be produced via different routes. Among them,
      biological fermentation processes are highly recommended due to eco-friendly and 
      economically viable approaches compared to that of thermochemical processes.
      However, the low H2 yield and high production cost are major bottlenecks for
      commercial scale operations. Thus, this review proposed an integrated
      microalgae-based H2 production process, which will provides a possible route for 
      commercialization in near future. Furthermore, process integration to improve
      efficiency and implementation of advanced strategies for the enhancement of
      bio-H2 production, economic viability, and future research needs are discussed.

AB  - This study examined the feasibility of dark fermentative biohydrogen production
      from food waste using hybrid immobilization in mesophilic condition. Among four
      different organic loading rates (OLRs), the highest average hydrogen production
      rate (HPR) of 9.82 +/- 0.30 L/L-d was found at an OLR of 74.7 g hexose/L-d, which
      was higher than reported values from particulate feedstock in mesophilic
      condition. The average hydrogen yield (HY) at the condition was 1.25 +/- 0.04 mol
      H2/mol hexoseconsumed. Whereas the average HPR and HY at an OLR 80 g hexose/L-d
      were 5.82 +/- 0.12 L/L-d and 0.64 +/- 0.02 mol H2/mol hexoseconsumed,
      respectively. Metabolic flux analysis showed the low HY was concurrent with the
      highest propionic acid and homoacetogenis. Bacterial population was shift from
      Clostridium sp. to non-hydrogen producers including Bifidobacterium, Bacteriodes,
      Olsenella, Dysgonomonas, and Dialister sp.

AB  - Biohydrogen production in Microbial Electrolysis Cell (MEC) had inspired the
      researchers to overcome the challenges associated towards sustainability. Despite
      microbial community and various substrates, economical cathode catalyst
      development is most significant factor for enhancing hydrogen production in the
      MEC. Hence, in this study, the performance of MEC was investigated with a sugar
      industry effluent (COD 4200 +/- 20 mg/L) with graphite anode and modified Nickel 
      foam (NF) cathode. Nickel molybdate (NiMoO4) coated NF achieved a higher hydrogen
      production rate 0.12 +/- 0.01 L.L(-1)D(-1) as compared to control under favorable
      conditions. Electrochemical characterizations demonstrated that the improved
      catalytic activity of novel nanocatalyst with lower impedance favoring faster
      hydrogen evolution kinetics. The MEC with the novel catalyst performed with 58.2%
      coloumbic efficiency, 20.36% cathodic hydrogen recovery, 11.96% overall hydrogen 
      recovery and 54.38% COD removal efficiency for a 250 mL substrate during 5 days' 
      batch cycle. Hence, the potentiality of modified cathode was established with the
      real time industrial effluent highlighting the waste to wealth
      bio-electrochemical technology.

AB  - Dark fermentation is a technically feasible technology for achieving carbon
      dioxide-free hydrogen production. This review presents the current findings on
      continuous hydrogen production using dark fermentation. Several operational
      strategies and reactor configurations have been suggested. The formation of
      attached mixed-culture microorganisms is a typical prerequisite for achieving
      high production rate, hydrogen yield, and resilience. To date, fixed-bed reactors
      and dynamic membrane bioreactors yielded higher biohydrogen performance than
      other configurations. The symbiosis between H2-producing bacteria and
      biofilm-forming bacteria was essential to avoid washout and maintain the high
      loading rates and hydrogenic metabolic flux. Recent research has initiated a more
      in-depth comparison of microbial community changes during dark fermentation,
      primarily with computational science techniques based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing
      investigations. Future techno-economic analysis of dark fermentative biohydrogen 
      production and perspectives on unraveling mitigation mechanisms induced by
      attached microorganisms in dark fermentation processes are further discussed.

AB  - Microalgal biohydrogen (bioH2) has attracted global interest owing to its
      potential carbon-free source of sustainable renewable energy. Most of previous
      reviews which focused on microalgal bioH2, have shown unclear differentiation
      among the metabolic pathways. In this review, investigation of all different
      metabolic pathways for microalgal bioH2 production along with discussion on the
      recent research work of last 5-years have been considered. The major factors
      (such as light, vital nutrients, microalgal cell density, and substrate
      bioavailability) are highlighted. Moreover, effect of various pretreatment
      approaches on the constituent's bioaccessibility is reported. Microbial
      electrolysis cells as a new strategy for bioH2 production is stated. Comparison
      between the operation conditions of various bioreactors and economic feasibility 
      is also emphasized. Genetic, metabolic engineering, and synthetic biology as
      recent technologies improved the microalgal bioH2 production through inactivation
      of uptake hydrogenase (H2ase), inhibition of the competing pathways in
      polysaccharide synthesis, and improving the O2 tolerant H2ase.

AB  - Pork production has expanded in the world in recent years. This growth has caused
      a significant increase in waste from this industry, especially of wastewater.
      Although there has been an increase in wastewater treatment, there is a lack of
      useful technologies for the treatment of wastewater from the pork industry. Swine
      farms generate high amounts of organic pollution, with large amounts of nitrogen 
      and phosphorus with final destination into water bodies. Sadly, little attention 
      has been devoted to animal wastes, which are currently treated in simple systems,
      such as stabilization ponds or just discharged to the environment without
      previous treatment. This uncontrolled release of swine wastewater is a major
      cause of eutrophication processes. Among the possible treatments,
      phyco-remediation seems to be a sustainable and environmentally friendly option
      of removing compounds from wastewater such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and some
      metal ions. Several studies have demonstrated the feasibility of treating swine
      wastewater using different microalgae species. Nevertheless, the practicability
      of applying this procedure at pilot-scale has not been explored before as an
      integrated process. This work presents an overview of the technological
      applications of microalgae for the treatment of wastewater from swine farms and
      the by-products (pigments, polysaccharides, lipids, proteins) and services of
      commercial interest (biodiesel, biohydrogen, bioelectricity, biogas) generated
      during this process. Furthermore, the environmental benefits while applying
      microalgae technologies are discussed.

TI  - Biohydrogen production by Chlorella vulgaris and Scenedesmus obliquus immobilized

AB  - The algal biotechnology together with the wastewater treatment can contribute to 
      the production of renewable energies such as bioethanol, biodiesel and
      biohydrogen and solve many of the challenges currently facing the shortage of
      fossil fuels and environmental impacts. Hydrogen as the cleanest source of energy
      is a promising alternative to conventional fossil fuels. Among different
      technologies for hydrogen production, photosynthetic microorganism, such as
      microalgae, has a great potential to produce hydrogen, by using only water and
      sunlight. One of the great opportunities is that microalgae can be cultivated in 
      urban wastewater, which contains sources of carbon and nutrients, helping to
      reduce the cost of biomass and energy production. Microalgae C. vulgaris and S.
      obliquus immobilized grown in urban wastewater was proposed for the production of
      biohydrogen by sulfur deprivation and two light quality prior to anaerobic
      condition at pH 7.5 and 30 degrees C and 140 microE/m(2)/s of light intensity.
      The results indicate that blue light induces greater algal growth than under
      Purple light, while the maximum hydrogen production was for cultures under purple
      light of 128 mL H2/L (productivity 204.8 mL H2/L/day) and 60.4 mL H2/L
      (productivity 39.18 mL H2/L/day) for S. obliquus and C. vulgaris, respectively.
      An additional advantage is the high removal of organic carbon by S. obliquus
      cultures under purple incident light compared to C. vulgaris, being a double
      benefit; energy production and wastewater treatment.

AB  - Expression of fdp, encoding a fasciclin I domain protein important for adherence 
      in the hydrogen-producing bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides, was investigated
      under a range of conditions to gain insights into optimization of adherence for
      immobilization strategies suitable for H2 production. The fdp promoter was linked
      to a lacZ reporter and expressed in wild type and in PRRB and PRRA mutant strains
      of the Prr regulatory pathway. Expression was significantly negatively regulated 
      by Prr under all conditions of aerobiosis tested including anaerobic conditions
      (required for H2 production), and aerobically regardless of growth phase, growth 
      medium complexity or composition, carbon source, heat and cold shock and
      dark/light conditions. Negative fdp regulation by Prr was reflected in cellular
      levels of translated Fdp protein. Since Prr is required directly for nitrogenase 
      expression, we propose optimization of Fdp-based adherence in R. sphaeroides for 
      immobilized biohydrogen production by inactivation of the PrrA binding site(s)
      upstream of fdp.

AB  - Recently, the production of renewable biogas such as biohydrogen and biomethane
      from wastewaters through anaerobic fermentation has gained worldwide attention.
      In the present study, a mobile bioenergy generation station had been constructed 
      based on a high-efficiency hydrogenesis & methanogenesis technology (HyMeTek)
      developed by Feng Chia University, Taiwan. The substrate was a beverage
      wastewater having chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentration of 1200 mg/L. This
      bioenergy station had a feedstock tank (3.8 m(3)), a nutrient tank (0.8 m(3)), an
      acidogenesis tank (AT, 2 m(3)), two methanogenesis tanks (MT, 4 m(3) for each), a
      membrane bioreactor and a control room. Biogas production rate, methane
      concentration, COD removal efficiencies, energy efficiency and economical
      interest of the plant were assessed. The peak total methane production rates for 
      AT (at hydraulic retention time, HRT, 4 h) and MT (at HRT 8 h) were 430 and 7
      mL/L.d, respectively. A strategy of shortening HRT was a promising method to
      enhance biogas quality and energy efficiency. This mobile bioenergy system has
      commercial potential because it could bring good economic benefit of initial rate
      of return (58.84%) and payback time (2.68 y).

AB  - The aim of this work was to develop a continuous liquid/gas membrane bioreactor
      (L/G MBR), i.e. a fermenting module including hollow fibers membrane for L/G
      separation, for biohydrogen production by dark fermentation. Originally seeded
      with sludge from a wastewater treatment plant, the L/G MBR underwent a complete
      stop for eight months. It was then operated without further reseeding. In the
      present experiment, performed 551 days after the last reseeding, average hydrogen
      yield of 1.1 +/- 0.2 mol per mol glucose added and hydrogen productivity of 135
      +/- 22 mL/L/h were reached, with acetate and butyrate as the main metabolite
      products. DNA sequence analysis revealed that Clostridium beijerinckii,
      Clostridium pasteurianum and Enterobacter sp. were dominant in liquid outlet, in 
      a biofilm on the surface of the hollow fibers and in microbial granules. The L/G 
      MBR has potential for the concentration and the long-term maintenance of an
      active hydrogen-producing bacterial community without need for reseeding.

AB  - This work characterizes and comparatively assess two cation exchange membranes
      (PSEBS SU22 and CF22 R14) and one bipolar membrane (FBM) in microbial
      electrolysis cells (MEC), fed either by acetate or the mixture of volatile fatty 
      acids as substrates. The PSEBS SU22 is a new, patent-pending material, while the 
      CF22 R14 and FBM are developmental and commercialized products. Based on the
      various MEC performance measures, membranes were ranked by the EXPROM-2 method to
      reveal which of the polymeric membranes could be more beneficial from a complex, 
      H2 production efficiency viewpoint. It turned out that the substrate-type
      influenced the application potential of the membranes. Still, in total, the PSEBS
      SU22 was found competitive with the other alternative materials. The evaluation
      of MEC was also supported by analyzing anodic biofilms following electroactive
      bacteria's development over time.

AB  - The stability of fermentative hydrogen production from the organic fraction of
      municipal solid waste (OFMSW) was evaluated in this work using a strategy of
      effluent recycling. Three pretreatment conditions were applied on the recycled
      effluent: a) no heat shock treatment, b) one initial heat shock treatment (90
      degrees C, 30 min) and c) systematic heat shock treatment at the beginning of
      each fermentation. When a systematic heat shock was applied, a maximal hydrogen
      yield of 17.2 +/- 3.8 mLH2/gVS was attained. The hydrogen productivity was
      improved by 331% reaching a stable value of 1.51 +/- 0.29 mLH2/gVS/h, after 8
      cycles of effluent recycling. This strategy caused a sharp decrease of diversity 
      with stable co-dominance of hydrogen- and lactate-producing bacteria, ie.
      Clostridiales and Lactobacillales, respectively. For the other conditions, a
      sharp decrease of the hydrogen yields was observed showing the importance of
      applying a heat shock treatment for optimal hydrogen production with effluent
      recycling.

AB  - In this study, Rhizopus oligosporus MTCC 556 (Rhizopus) treated rice bran was
      utilized for the anaerobic bacterial fermentative hydrogen production. The
      Enterobacter aerogenes MTCC 2822 with nutrients addition fermented the treated
      rice bran to give hydrogen yield of 5.4 mmol H2/g of biomass. A closely similar
      hydrogen yield of 4.6 mmol H2/g of biomass was obtained from the treated rice
      bran under the condition without nutrients addition, suggesting the potential of 
      the fungus treatment to produce hydrogen from nutrient-free fermentation. The
      pretreated rice bran showed efficient hydrogen production upon anaerobic
      fermentation without nutrients addition. The Rhizopus pretreated biomass can
      provide required nutrients for the enhancement of hydrogen yield by anaerobic
      fermentation. The Rhizopus pretreatment of rice bran enhanced the hydrogen
      production under nutrient-free conditions which reduced the overall production
      cost. The findings provide a promising solution to efficiently utilize the rice
      bran waste for low cost hydrogen production.

TI  - Influence of nutrient status on the biohydrogen and lipid productivity in
      Parachlorella kessleri: a biorefinery approach.
PG  - 10293-10305

AB  - The commercial reality of microalgal biotechnology for the production of
      individual bioactives is constrained by the high cost of production and requires 
      a biorefinery approach. In this investigation, we examined the influence of
      different nutrient deprivation (nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), sulphur (S) and
      manganese (Mn)) on growth, chlorophyll a (Chl a), biohydrogen (H2) and fatty acid
      profiles in Parachlorella kessleri EMCCN 3073 under both aerobic and anaerobic
      conditions. Anaerobic conditions combined with the nutrient deprivation resulted 
      in cell division blockage, reduction in Chl a and remarkable changes in pH,
      whereas a significant increase in the H2 production was observed after 24 h. The 
      highest cumulative H2 productivity was observed in N-deficient medium (300 muL/L,
      day 9) followed by Mn-deficient medium (250 muL/L, day 7). The highest H2
      production rate (3.37 muL/L/h) was achieved by Mn-deficient medium after 24 h. In
      terms of fatty acid composition, P. kessleri exhibited a differential response to
      different nutrient stresses. Under aerobic conditions, N-deficient media resulted
      in the highest lipid content (119% compared to control, day 7), whereas earlier
      lipid induction at (1-3 days) was observed with Mn- and S-deficient media with
      18-91% and 25-34% increase, respectively, compared with the replete control.
      Meanwhile, higher lipid content was observed under anaerobic conditions combined 
      with Mn-, N-, P- and S-deprived media (day 1) with 20%, 13%, 8% and 7% increases 
      respectively compared with the control. This investigation, for the first time
      clearly, highlights the potential of P. kessleri as a sustainable biorefinery
      platform, for H2 and fatty acid bio-production under anaerobic conditions. KEY
      POINTS: * Parachlorella kessleri could provide a future sustainable biorefinery
      platform. * Nutrient-deprived anaerobic conditions blocked cell growth but
      differentially induced H2 production. * Nutrient status, under both
      aerobic/anaerobic conditions, alters lipids and fatty acids profile of P.
      kessleri. * Nutrient-deprived (N- and Mn-) anaerobic conditions: future
      biorefinery platform.

AB  - The aim of this work was to study the biological catalysts and possible substrate
      conversion routes in mesophilic dark fermentation reactors aimed at producing H2 
      from olive mill wastewater. Bacillus and Clostridium were the most abundant
      phylotypes during the rapid stage of H2 production. Chemical analyses combined
      with predictive functional profiling of the bacterial communities indicated that 
      the lactate fermentation was the main H2-producing route. In fact, during the
      fermentation process, lactate and acetate were consumed, while H2 and butyrate
      were being produced. The fermentation process was rich in genes that encode
      enzymes for lactate generation from pyruvate. Lactate conversion to butyrate
      through the generation of pyruvate produced H2 through the recycling of electron 
      carriers via the pyruvate ferredoxin oxydoreductase pathway. Overall, these
      findings showed the synergy among lactate-, acetate- and H2-producing bacteria,
      which complex interactions determine the H2 production routes in the bioreactors.

AB  - Co-digestion of substrates can improve hydrogen yield (HY) by adjusting carbon
      nitrogen ratio (C/N) of fermentation substrates. This study evaluated the
      enhancement of hydrogen production from co-digestion of duckweed and corn straw
      via photo-fermentation. The maximum HY of 78.0 mL/g Total solid (TS) was obtained
      from the mixed ratio of 5:1 (C/N of 13.2), which was 25.4% and 29.6% higher than 
      those of single substrate of duckweed and corn straw, respectively. The effects
      of initial pH and inoculation volume ratio (IVR) on co-digestion
      photo-fermentative hydrogen production (CD-PFHP) from duckweed and corn straw
      were further studied. A maximum HY of 85.6 mL/g TS was achieved under the optimal
      condition (initial pH 8, IVR 20%, mix ratio of duckweed and corn straw of 5:1).
      Additionally, both mix ratio and initial pH showed statistical difference (p <
      0.05). Acetic acid and butyric acid were found to be the main metabolic
      by-products during CD-PFHP.

LID - 10.1007/s00449-020-02443-0 [doi]
AB  - This study evaluated an anaerobic fluidized bed reactor to produce hydrogen from 
      sugarcane molasses of 25 g-COD L(-1). The reactor of 1.2 L working volume
      contained shredded tires as support material. The inoculum was sludge obtained in
      a UASB reactor of a sewage treatment plant. The AFBR was operated at hydraulic
      retention times of 12, 6, 4 and 3 h. The maximum hydrogen production rate (1.44
      L-H2 h(-1) L(-1)) and the highest hydrogen yield (3.07 mol-H2 mol(-1)-glucose)
      occurred at HRT of 4 and 6 h, respectively. The highest COD removal (23.3 +/-
      8.5%) was achieved at HRT of 12 h, while the HRT of 6 h presented the maximum
      carbohydrate conversion of 70.1 +/- 2.2%. Ethanol (44-67%) and acetic acid
      (18-38%) were the main metabolites produced, emphasizing a predominance of
      ethanol-type fermentation pathway in the process. The PCR-DGGE analysis revealed 
      that the bacterial community presented a maximum similarity of 88% between HRT of
      4 and 3 h, indicating that the microbial dynamic altered as the organic load has 
      increased. The highest Shannon-Winner index of 2.77 was obtained at HRT of 6 h,
      inferring that higher microbial diversity favored hydrogen production.

AB  - Microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) is one of the promising biohydrogen
      production technologies for which low-cost cathode materials are required and
      developed to propel the rapid development of MECs. Herein, the preparation of a
      low-cost Ce0.1 -Ni-Y composite is reported by using Y zeolite as carrier loaded
      with nickel (Ni) and cerium (Ce) as active components and its prominent
      electrochemical performance. The XPS analysis reveals that strong electronic
      interaction between Ni and Ce makes a great contribution to the electrochemical
      performance enhancement. The Ce0.1 -Ni-Y with a peak current density of 39.8
      Am(-2) in LSV, Tafel slope of 40.81 mVdec(-1) , ECSA of 34.3 and hydrogen yield
      of 0.312+/-0.013 m(3) m(-3) d(-1) are significantly superior to that of its
      parent Ni-Y counterpart and rival the performance of commercially Pt/C, which
      renders it a very promising hydrogen evolution catalyst for MECs.

TI  - Production of Biohydrogen and/or Poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate by Rhodopseudomonas
      sp. Using Various Carbon Sources as Substrate.
PG  - 307-318
LID - 10.1007/s12010-020-03428-1 [doi]
AB  - The polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) are family of biopolyesters synthesized by
      numerous bacteria which are attracting a great attention due to their
      thermoplastic properties. Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) is the most common type of
      PHA which presents thermoplastic and biodegradable properties. It is synthesized 
      under stressful conditions by heterotrophic bacteria and many photosynthetic
      microorganisms such as purple non-sulfur bacteria and cyanobacteria. Biological
      hydrogen (H2) production is being evaluated for use as a fuel since it is a
      promising substitute for carbonaceous fuels owing to its high conversion
      efficiency and high specific content. In the present work, the purple non-sulfur 
      photosynthetic bacterium Rhodopseudomonas sp. for the simultaneous H2
      photo-evolution and poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) production has been
      investigated. Three different types of carbon sources were tested in the presence
      of glutamate as a nitrogen source in a batch cultivation system, under continuous
      irradiance. The results indicated the fact that the type of carbon source in the 
      culture broth affects in various ways the metabolic activity of the bacterial
      biomass, as evidenced by the production of PHB and/or H2 and biomass. The best
      carbon source for PHB accumulation and H2 production by Rhodopseudomonas sp.
      turned out to be the acetate, having the highest H2 production (2286 mL/L) and
      PHB accumulation (68.99 mg/L, 18.28% of cell dry weight).

AB  - The current research reports the effects of low-intensity extremely high
      frequency electromagnetic irradiation (EMI) of 51.8 GHz and 53.0 GHz on green
      microalga Parachlorella kessleri RA-002 isolated in Armenia. EMI demonstrated
      different effects on the growth properties of microalgae under various
      conditions. Under aerobic conditions a positive effect of EMI on the growth rate 
      of P. kessleri and the content of photosynthetic pigments were observed. The data
      obtained indicates a significant role of O2, since the enhancing effect of EMI
      was determined only under aerobic conditions. Meanwhile under anaerobic
      conditions EMI with both frequencies caused inhibition of algal growth and a
      decrease in the amount of photosynthetic pigments. EMI also inhibited the yield
      of H2 production in P. kessleri, which was partially restored after 5-day
      cultivation due to the existence of protective mechanisms in this alga. The
      results might indicate membrane-bound mechanisms of EMI action on algae, which
      can be associated with the effects on photosynthetic pigments and
      membrane-associated enzymes responsible for H2 production. The results are useful
      for the development of algae biotechnology and the possibility of using EMI as a 
      factor which regulates the production of biomass and biohydrogen by green
      microalgae.

AB  - Utilizing light energy for hydrogen production by combining nano-bio inspired
      photosynthetic system has received remarkable attention in renewable energy
      production. In this study, we applied a sodium alginate encapsulation strategy to
      our previously developed nano-bio hybrid system for photocatalytic hydrogen
      production under aerobic condition by combining the inorganic semiconductor
      titanium dioxide (TiO2), electron mediator methylviologen (MV(2+)), along with E.
      coli (hydrogenases) in an encapsulated system under the given light intensity of 
      2000 W m(-2) and its hydrogen production efficiency was studied. Under aerobic
      condition the encapsulated hybrid system produced hydrogen (2.4 mmol H2/ mmol
      glucose) 3-fold higher than the unencapsulated hybrid system (0.8 mmol H2/ mmol
      glucose), suggesting that encapsulation is essential to protect oxygen sensitive 
      hydrogenase under aerobic condition. The encapsulated hybrid system was also
      feasible under direct sunlight for hydrogen production. Overall, this study could
      serve as a new strategy for biological hydrogen production under aerobic
      condition.

AB  - Treatment of industrial and domestic wastewater is very important to protect
      downstream users from health risks and meet the freshwater demand of the
      ever-increasing world population. Different types of wastewater (textile, dairy, 
      pharmaceutical, swine, municipal, etc.) vary in composition and require different
      treatment strategies. Wastewater management and treatment is an expensive
      process; hence, it is important to integrate relevant technology into this
      process to make it more feasible and cost-effective. Wastewater treatment using
      microalgae-based technology could be a global solution for resource recovery from
      wastewater and to provide affordable feedstock for bioenergy (biodiesel,
      biohydrogen, bio-alcohol, methane, and bioelectricity) production. Various
      microalgal cultivation systems (open or closed photobioreactors), turf scrubber, 
      and hybrid systems have been developed. Although many algal biomass harvesting
      methods (physical, chemical, biological, and electromagnetic) have been reported,
      it is still an expensive process. In this review article, resource recovery from 
      wastewater using algal cultivation, biomass harvesting, and various technologies 
      applied in converting algal biomass into bioenergy, along with the various
      challenges that are encountered are discussed in brief.

AB  - The stimulant and toxicity effects of reported organic (acetic acid, propionic
      acid, butyric acid, formic acid, oil & grease) and inorganic (copper) by-products
      presented in palm oil mill effluent on anaerobic bacterial population were
      examined in this paper. The toxicity test had shown that acetic, propionic and
      butyric acids tend to stimulate the bacterial density level (survival rate more
      than 50%), while formic acid, copper, oil and grease were shown to have
      suppressed the density level (survival rate less than 50%). The highest biomass
      recorded was 1.66 mg/L for the concentration of acetic acid at 216 mg/L and
      lowest biomass concentration, 0.90 mg/L for copper at 1.40 mg/L.
      Biohydrogen-producing bacteria have a favourable growth rate around pH 5.5. The
      comparison of half maximal effective concentration (EC50) values between two test
      duration on the effects of organic and inorganic by-products postulate that
      bacteria had a higher tolerance towards volatile fatty acids. While acetic,
      butyric and propionic acids had exhibited higher tolerance EC50 values for
      bacteria, but the opposite trend was observed for formic acid, copper and oil &
      grease.

TI  - Heterologous Hydrogenase Overproduction Systems for Biotechnology-An Overview.
LID - E5890 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms21165890 [doi]
AB  - Hydrogenases are complex metalloenzymes, showing tremendous potential as
      H2-converting redox catalysts for application in light-driven H2 production,
      enzymatic fuel cells and H2-driven cofactor regeneration. They catalyze the
      reversible oxidation of hydrogen into protons and electrons. The apo-enzymes are 
      not active unless they are modified by a complicated post-translational
      maturation process that is responsible for the assembly and incorporation of the 
      complex metal center. The catalytic center is usually easily inactivated by
      oxidation, and the separation and purification of the active protein is
      challenging. The understanding of the catalytic mechanisms progresses slowly,
      since the purification of the enzymes from their native hosts is often difficult,
      and in some case impossible. Over the past decades, only a limited number of
      studies report the homologous or heterologous production of high yields of
      hydrogenase. In this review, we emphasize recent discoveries that have greatly
      improved our understanding of microbial hydrogenases. We compare various
      heterologous hydrogenase production systems as well as in vitro hydrogenase
      maturation systems and discuss their perspectives for enhanced biohydrogen
      production. Additionally, activities of hydrogenases isolated from either
      recombinant organisms or in vivo/in vitro maturation approaches were
      systematically compared, and future perspectives for this research area are
      discussed.

AB  - Research of single-stage anaerobic biohythane production is still in an infant
      stage. A single-stage dark fermentation system using separately-entrapped H2- and
      CH4-producing microbes was operated to produce biohythane at hydraulic retention 
      times (HRTs) of 48, 36, 24, 12 and 6 h. Peak biohythane production was obtained
      at HRT 12 h with H2 and CH4 production rates of 3.16 and 4.25 L/L-d,
      respectively. At steady-state conditions, H2 content in biohythane and COD
      removal efficiency were in ranges of 7.3-84.6 % and 70.4-77.9%, respectively.
      During the fermentation, the microbial community structure of the entrapped
      H2-producing microbes was HRT-independent whereas entrapped CH4-producing
      microbes changed at HRTs 12 and 6 h. Caproiciproducens and Methanobacterium were 
      the dominant genera for producing H2 and CH4, respectively. The novelty of this
      work is to develop a single-stage biohythane production system using entrapped
      anaerobic microbes which requires fewer controls than two-stage systems.

AB  - In this work, lawsone (LQ) and anthraquinone 2-sulphonate (AQS) (dissolved and
      covalently immobilized on activated carbon) were evaluated as redox mediators
      during the dark fermentation of glucose by a pretreated anaerobic sludge.
      Findings revealed that the use of dissolved LQ increased H2 production (10%), and
      dissolved AQS improved H2 production rate (11.4%). Furthermore, the total
      production of liquid byproducts (acetate, butyrate, ethanol, and butanol) was
      enhanced using dissolved (17%) and immobilized (36%) redox mediators. The
      established redox standard potentials of LQ and AQS suggested a possible
      interaction through electron transfer in cytochromes complexes for hydrogen
      production and the Bcd/EtfAB complex for volatile fatty acid formation.

AB  - To reduce start-up time and enhance hydrogen production efficiency, a sequential 
      immobilization and deoxygenization (SIDO) strategy for hydrogen production was
      investigated in continuous-flow moving bed biofilm reactors (MBBRs). The
      pre-immobilization process accelerated the initial enrichment of
      hydrogen-producing bacteria (HPB) and promoted the biofilm formation, which
      contribute to higher hydrogen production efficiency in SIDO-MBBRs compared to a
      non-immobilized reactor. A similar deoxygenization effect was achieved by
      inoculation with Pseudomonas aeruginosa compared with N2 sparging, and the P.
      aeruginosa pre-immobilized MBBR (Pse-MBBR) showed a higher H2 yield in the
      initial stage of operation. Microbial community analysis found a higher abundance
      of putative HPB in the range of 82.82-96.56%, with the predominant populations in
      the SIDO-MBBR assigned to genera Clostridium and Enterobacter. The results
      suggest that the SIDO-MBBR is an effective approach for rapid recruitment of HPB

AB  - Dark fermentative biohydrogen (H2) production could become a key technology for
      providing renewable energy. Until now, the H2 yield is restricted to 4 moles of
      H2 per mole of glucose, referred to as the "Thauer limit". Here we show, that
      precision design of artificial microbial consortia increased the H2 yield to 5.6 
      mol mol(-1) glucose, 40% higher than the Thauer limit. In addition, the
      volumetric H2 production rates of our defined artificial consortia are superior
      compared to any mono-, co- or multi-culture system reported to date. We hope this
      study to be a major leap forward in the engineering of artificial microbial
      consortia through precision design and provide a breakthrough in energy science, 
      biotechnology and ecology. Constructing artificial consortia with this
      drawing-board approach could in future increase volumetric production rates and
      yields of other bioprocesses. Our artificial consortia engineering blueprint
      might pave the way for the development of a H2 production bioindustry.

AB  - We introduce an experimental setup allowing continuous monitoring of bacterial
      fermentation processes by simultaneous optical density (OD) measurements,
      long-path FTIR headspace monitoring of CO2, acetaldehyde and ethanol, and liquid 
      Raman spectroscopy of acetate, formate, and phosphate anions, without sampling.
      We discuss which spectral features are best suited for detection, and how to
      obtain partial pressures and concentrations by integrations and least squares
      fitting of spectral features. Noise equivalent detection limits are about 2.6 mM 
      for acetate and 3.6 mM for formate at 5 min integration time, improving to 0.75
      mM for acetate and 1.0 mM for formate at 1 h integration. The analytical range
      extends to at least 1 M with a standard deviation of percentage error of about
      8%. The measurement of the anions of the phosphate buffer allows the
      spectroscopic, in situ determination of the pH of the bacterial suspension via a 
      modified Henderson-Hasselbalch equation in the 6-8 pH range with an accuracy
      better than 0.1. The 4 m White cell FTIR measurements provide noise equivalent
      detection limits of 0.21 mubar for acetaldehyde and 0.26 mubar for ethanol in the
      gas phase, corresponding to 3.2 muM acetaldehyde and 22 muM ethanol in solution, 
      using Henry's law. The analytical dynamic range exceeds 1 mbar ethanol
      corresponding to 85 mM in solution. As an application example, the mixed acid
      fermentation of Escherichia coli is studied. The production of CO2, ethanol,
      acetaldehyde, acids such as formate and acetate, and the changes in pH are
      discussed in the context of the mixed acid fermentation pathways. Formate
      decomposition into CO2 and H2 is found to be governed by a zeroth-order kinetic
      rate law, showing that adding exogenous formate to a bioreactor with E. coli is
      expected to have no beneficial effect on the rate of formate decomposition and
      biohydrogen production.

TI  - Molecular biohydrogen production by dark and photo fermentation from wastes
      containing starch: recent advancement and future perspective.
PG  - 1-25
LID - 10.1007/s00449-020-02422-5 [doi]
AB  - Changing lifestyle is increasing the energy demand. Fossil fuel is unable to
      deliver such huge energy. Clean energy from renewable source can solve this
      problem. Hydrogen is a clean and energy-efficient fuel and used for electricity
      generation by fuel cells or can be used in combustion engine. Easy availability
      of starch wastes from different industrial food processing wastes makes it a
      potential source for hydrogen (H2) generation. Among various processes such as
      steam reforming, electrolysis, biophotolysis of water and anaerobic fermentation,
      anaerobic fermentation technique is environmentally friendly and requires less
      external energy, making it a preferred process for H2 generation. Dark
      fermentation process can use wide range of substrates including agricultural and 
      industrial starchy waste with low level of undesirable compounds. Application of 
      both anaerobic dark and photofermentation can improve H2 yield and production
      rate. H2 production from wastes containing starch serves dual benefit of waste
      reduction and energy generation. As starch is a polymer and all
      hydrogen-producing bacteria cannot produce amylase to hydrolyze it, a
      pretreatment step is required to convert starch into glucose and maltose. In this
      present review paper, we have summarized: (i) potential of various types of
      starch-containing wastes as feedstock, (ii) various fermentation techniques,
      (iii) optimization of external process parameter, (iv) application of bioreactor 
      and simulation in fermentation technique and (v) advancement in H2 production
      from starchy wastes.

AB  - Municipal solid waste is an environmental threat worldwide; however, the organic 
      fraction of municipal solid waste (OF-MSW) has a great potential for the
      generation of fuels and high-value products. In the current study, OF-MSW was
      utilized for the production of ethanol, hydrogen, as well as 2,3-butanediol, an
      octane booster, by using Enterobacter aerogenes. Furthermore, a promising
      alternative to non-biodegradable petrochemical-based polymers,
      polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), was produced. The OF-MSW was first pretreated by an
      acetic acid catalyzed ethanol organosolv pretreatment at 120 and 160 degrees C
      followed by enzymatic hydrolysis of the residual solids. The residual
      unhydrolyzed solids resulting from enzymatic hydrolysis were further
      anaerobically digested for methane production. The enzymatic hydrolysis of the
      solids prepared at 120 degrees C for 60 min led to the production of hydrolysate 
      with the highest glucose production yield of 498.5 g/kg dry untreated OF-MSW,
      which was fermented to 139.1 g 2,3-butanediol, 98.3 g ethanol, 28.6 g acetic
      acid, 71.4 L biohydrogen, and 40 g PHAs. Moreover, 23.1 L biomethane was produced
      through the anaerobic digestion of the enzymatic hydrolysis residue solids. Thus,
      appreciable amounts of energy (8236.9 kJ) and an eco-friendly bioplastic were
      produced by the valorization of carbon sources available in OF-MSW.

AB  - The applicability and convenience of biohydrogen and poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate
      production through single-stage photofermentation of winery wastewater is
      demonstrated in the present study. Experiments are conducted using a purple
      non-sulfur bacteria mixed consortium, subject to variable nutrient conditions, to
      analyze the effect of initial chemical oxygen demand and the available nitrogen
      source on the metabolic response. Results show that winery wastewater is a
      promising substrate for photofermentation processes, despite the presence of
      inhibiting compounds such as phenolics. Nonetheless, the initial chemical oxygen 
      demand must be carefully controlled to maximize hydrogen production. Up to 468 mL
      L(-1) of hydrogen and 203 mg L(-1) of poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate can be produced
      starting from an initial chemical oxygen demand of 1500 mg L(-1). The used
      nitrogen source may direct substrate transformation through different metabolic
      pathways. Interestingly, the maximum production of both hydrogen and
      poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate occurred when glutamate was used as the nitrogen
      source.

AB  - An inorganic-biological hybrid system that integrates features of both stable and
      efficient semiconductors and selective and efficient enzymes is attractive for
      facilitating the conversion of solar energy to hydrogen. In this study, we aimed 
      to develop a new photocatalytic hydrogen-production system based on Escherichia
      coli whole-cell genetically engineered as a biocatalysis for highly active
      hydrogen formation. The photocatalysis part was obtained by bacterial
      precipitation of cadmium sulfide (CdS), which is a visible-light-responsive
      semiconductor. The recombinant E. coli cells were sequentially subjected to CdS
      precipitation and heterologous [FeFe]-hydrogenase synthesis to yield a CdS@E.
      coli hybrid capable of light energy conversion and hydrogen formation in a single
      cell. The CdS@E. coli hybrid achieved photocatalytic hydrogen production with a
      sacrificial electron donor, thus demonstrating the feasibility of our system and 
      expanding the current knowledge of photosensitization using a whole-cell
      biocatalyst with a bacterially precipitated semiconductor.

TI  - Fixing the Broken Phosphorus Cycle: Wastewater Remediation by Microalgal
      Polyphosphates.
PG  - 982
LID - 10.3389/fpls.2020.00982 [doi]
AB  - Phosphorus (P), in the form of phosphate derived from either inorganic (Pi) or
      organic (Po) forms is an essential macronutrient for all life. P undergoes a
      biogeochemical cycle within the environment, but anthropogenic redistribution
      through inefficient agricultural practice and inadequate nutrient recovery at
      wastewater treatment works have resulted in a sustained transfer of P from rock
      deposits to land and aquatic environments. Our present and near future supply of 
      P is primarily mined from rock P reserves in a limited number of geographical
      regions. To help ensure that this resource is adequate for humanity's food
      security, an energy-efficient means of recovering P from waste and recycling it
      for agriculture is required. This will also help to address excess discharge to
      water bodies and the resulting eutrophication. Microalgae possess the advantage
      of polymeric inorganic polyphosphate (PolyP) storage which can potentially
      operate simultaneously with remediation of waste nitrogen and phosphorus streams 
      and flue gases (CO2, SOx, and NOx). Having high productivity in photoautotrophic,
      mixotrophic or heterotrophic growth modes, they can be harnessed in wastewater
      remediation strategies for biofuel production either directly (biodiesel) or in
      conjunction with anaerobic digestion (biogas) or dark fermentation (biohydrogen).
      Regulation of algal P uptake, storage, and mobilization is intertwined with the
      cellular status of other macronutrients (e.g., nitrogen and sulphur) in addition 
      to the manufacture of other storage products (e.g., carbohydrate and lipids) or
      macromolecules (e.g., cell wall). A greater understanding of controlling factors 
      in this complex interaction is required to facilitate and improve P control,
      recovery, and reuse from waste streams. The best understood algal genetic model
      is Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in terms of utility and shared resources. It also
      displays mixotrophic growth and advantageously, species of this genus are often
      found growing in wastewater treatment plants. In this review, we focus primarily 
      on the molecular and genetic aspects of PolyP production or turnover and place
      this knowledge in the context of wastewater remediation and highlight
      developments and challenges in this field.

AB  - The remarkable buffer capacity of buffer solution can significantly improve the
      biohydrogen production yield and energy conversion efficiency. In the present
      study, the effect of buffer solution Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4 on buffer capacity of
      fermentation broth and photo-fermentation biohydrogen production (PFHP) was
      studied. Gas characteristics, fermentation broth properties, and kinetic
      parameters in PFHP were investigated. With the increase in pH values (5-7) of
      buffer solution Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, firstly hydrogen yield increased and then
      decreased. Maximum energy conversion efficiency 9.84%, hydrogen yield 132.69 mL/g
      corn stalk, and hydrogen content 53.88% were achieved at pH value of 6. The
      results of one-way ANOVA showed that pH values of fermentation broth and
      cumulative hydrogen production were strongly affected by pH values of buffer
      solution. Buffer solution Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4 retarded the decrease of pH value of
      photo-fermentation broth, and significantly improved the PFHP.

TI  - Biohydrogen Production by Catalytic Supercritical Water Gasification: A
      Comparative Study.
PG  - 15390-15401
LID - 10.1021/acsomega.9b01782 [doi]
AB  - In this article, supercritical water gasification of biocrude at different
      conditions was performed and compared to each other. Three scenarios were
      considered while treating biocrude originating from cattle manure (CM) and corn
      husk (CH), namely, uncatalyzed feedstock, catalyzed with 10% Ni-0.08% Ru/Al2O3
      and finally catalyzed with 10% Ni-0.08% Ru/Al2O3-ZrO2. It was found that 10%
      Ni-0.08% Ru/Al2O3-ZrO2 has performed significantly better than the other two
      scenarios over the 5 hour run time with a 193 and 187% higher hydrogen yield
      compared to the uncatalyzed and 10% Ni-0.08% Ru/Al2O3 catalyzed scenarios,
      respectively. Compared to CM gasification in the presence of a 10% Ni-0.08%
      Ru/Al2O3-ZrO2 catalyst, the catalyst got deactivated because of the high phenol
      and furan content in the corn husk biocrude, therefore hydrogen yield performance
      fell significantly. It was observed that the carbon gasification efficiency of
      the biocrude was independent of temperature. In terms of carbon conversion, the
      equilibrium conditions for the biocrude considered were attained at lower
      temperature. A mechanistic model based on the Eley-Rideal method was devised and 
      tested against the obtained data. The dissociation of adsorbed oxygenated
      hydrocarbon is found to be the rate-determining step with an average absolute
      deviation of 3.55%.

LID - 10.1155/2020/8885662 [doi]
AB  - The biohydrogen production efficiency and performance of hydrogen-producing
      acetogen in a four-compartment anaerobic baffled reactor (ABR) were studied by
      gradually increasing the influent normal molasses wastewater (NMWW) proportion.
      When the influent NMWW proportion increased to 55%, ABR could develop microbial
      community with methanogenic function in 63 days and reach a stable operation.
      When the influent NMWW proportion increased to 80% and reached a stable state,
      ethanol fermentation was established from butyric acid fermentation in the first 
      three compartments, whereas butyric acid fermentation in the fourth compartment
      was strengthened. The average biohydrogen production yield and biohydrogen
      production capacity by COD removal increased to as high as 12.85 L/day and 360.22
      L/kg COD when the influent NMWW proportion increased from 55% to 80%,
      respectively. Although the biogas yield and the specific biogas production rate
      reached 61.54 L/day and 232 L/kg MLVSS.day, the biohydrogen production yield and 
      specific biohydrogen production rate were only 12.85 L/day and 48 L/kg MLVSS.day,
      which results in hydrogen consumption by homoacetogenesis and methanogenesis.

AB  - In this study, the biohydrogen production ability of isolated strains with sago
      industrial effluent in anaerobic batch fermentation was investigated. The
      bacteria responsible for the biohydrogen were isolated and identified as
      Clostridium sartagoforme NASGE 01 and Enterobacter cloacae NASGE 02. The volume
      of biohydrogen gas generated from the effluent was determined by gas
      chromatography (GC) and the organic acids formed during the biohydrogen
      production were determined by GC equipped with a flame ionization detector
      (GC-FID). In batch fermentation, C. sartagoforme NASGE 01 produced high amount of
      biogas (232 +/- 11.02 mL/L) and biohydrogen (41.5%) followed by E. cloacae NASGE 
      02 produced 212.8 +/- 8 mL/L biogas containing 31.5% of biohydrogen. Moreover,
      the hydrogen production potential (P), production rate (Rm) and lag time (lambda)
      were analyzed from Gompertz non-linear curve fit model. The peak hydrogen yield
      was obtained with C. sartagoforme NASGE 01 was 158.7 mL/g glucose (1.26 mol
      H2/mol glucose) with the substrate degradation of 56.7%. Butyric acid was the
      major organic acid formed while hydrogen production with Clostridium sartagoforme
      NASGE 01 (176.4 mg/L) and Enterobacter cloacae NASGE 02 (285.1 mg/L). These
      experimental data demonstrated the feasibility of biohydrogen production using
      pure culture of anaerobic bacteria with sago industrial waste water as substrate.

AB  - Hydrogen production by dark fermentation of complex organic substrates, such as
      biowaste, can naturally take place with indigenous bacteria or by adding an
      external microbial inoculum issued from various natural environments. This study 
      aims to determine whether indigenous bacteria associated with thermal
      pretreatment could impact dark fermentation performances. Biochemical hydrogen
      potential tests were carried out on seven organic substrates. Results showed a
      strong influence of the indigenous bacteria which are as effective as thermally
      pretreated exogenous bacteria to produce H2 and metabolites. High abundance in
      Clostridiales and/or Enterobacteriales was associated with high H2 yield. This
      study shows that no inoculum nor pretreatment are required to achieve
      satisfactory dark fermentation performances from organic waste.

AB  - The main aim of this work was to develop sustainable catalyst from geothermal
      waste by hydrothermal process for enhanced biohydrogen production. The effects of
      Si/Al ratio and pH neutralization on the catalyst were also investigated to
      provide further insight into the hydrogen production capability. Results have
      shown with increasing Si/Al ratio, a lower amount of catalyst was synthesized and
      smaller particle size was obtained. pH neutralization treatment resulted in
      higher conversion compared to non-neutralized ones. Meanwhile, the highest
      conversion of biohydrogen from ethanol through steam reforming process (95.19%)
      was obtained from catalyst with pH neutralization treatment and Si/Al ratio of
      10. The catalyst developed in this study was concluded to be suitable for
      framework/supporting catalyst due to relatively low selectivity.

AB  - Palm oil mill effluent (POME) was tested as a substrate to produce hydrogen by
      dark fermentation. Two microbial consortia and a pure culture of Clostridium
      beijerinckii (ATCC 8260) were cultured anaerobically in raw, diluted and
      hydrolyzed POME to compare biohydrogen production yields in all three media.
      Experiments were done in 15mL Hungate tubes containing 5mL of medium and 1mL of
      inoculum. When Clostridium beijerinckii was cultivated at 30 degrees C in the
      hydrolyzed POME (P003), containing 7.5g/L of sucrose, during 8 days of
      fermentation and 20 % of the inoculum, the maximum biohydrogen production yield
      was 4.62 LH2/Lmed. Consortium C3 also showed the best production in hydrolyzed
      POME while consortium C6 achieved its maximum production in raw POME. This
      effluent is a potential substrate for biohydrogen production.

AB  - Metabolic potential of two different cultures, facultative (FB) and strict
      anaerobes (AB) under two microenvironments [anoxic (ANOX) and anaerobic (ANA)]
      was evaluated to understand acidogenic fermentation in a self-induced
      electrofermentation (EF) system for the production of short-chain fatty acids
      (SCFA: C2-C4) and biogas. ANA condition positively influenced FB and AB
      metabolism towards higher acetic (C2:2390 mg/L) and propionic acid (C3: 717 mg/L)
      production, while butyric acid (C4:1481 mg/L) favored ANOX microenvironment (AB).
      ANOX microenvironment showed a better self-induced potential compared to ANA
      metabolism (0.46 V (FBANOX); 0.45 V (ABANOX)). An improved H2 (>30%) fraction was
      noticed with FB while CH4 production was found favourable with AB. The study
      illustrated the role of system microenvironment in association with metabolic
      function towards regulating electrofermentation towards specific products
      synthesis.

TI  - Transparent polyvinyl-alcohol cryogel as immobilisation matrix for continuous
      biohydrogen production by phototrophic bacteria.
PG  - 105
LID - 10.1186/s13068-020-01743-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Phototrophic purple non-sulfur bacteria (PNSB) have gained attention 
      for their ability to produce a valuable clean energy source in the form
      biohydrogen via photofermentation of a wide variety of organic wastes. For
      maturation of these phototrophic bioprocesses towards commercial feasibility,
      development of suitable immobilisation materials is required to allow continuous 
      production from a stable pool of catalytic biomass in which energy is not
      diverted towards biomass accumulation, and optimal hydrogen production rates are 
      realised. Here, the application of transparent polyvinyl-alcohol (PVA) cryogel
      beads to immobilisation of Rhodopseudomonas palustris for long-term hydrogen
      production is described. PVA cryogel properties are characterised and
      demonstrated to be well suited to the purpose of continuous photofermentation.
      Finally, analysis of the long-term biocompatibility of the material is
      illustrated. RESULTS: The addition of glycerol co-solvent induces favourable
      light transmission properties in normally opaque PVA cryogels, especially
      well-suited to the near-infrared light requirements of PNSB. Material
      characterisation showed high mechanical resilience, low resistance to diffusion
      of substrates and high biocompatibility of the material and immobilisation
      process. The glycerol co-solvent in transparent cryogels offered additional
      benefit by reinforcing physical interactions to the extent that only a single
      freeze-thaw cycle was required to form durable cryogels, extending utility beyond
      only phototrophic bioprocesses. In contrast, conventional PVA cryogels require
      multiple cycles which compromise viability of entrapped organisms. Hydrogen
      production studies of immobilised Rhodopseudomonas palustris in batch
      photobioreactors showed higher specific hydrogen production rates which continued
      longer than planktonic cultures. Continuous cultivation yielded hydrogen
      production for at least 67 days from immobilised bacteria, demonstrating the
      suitability of PVA cryogel immobilisation for long-term phototrophic
      bioprocesses. Imaged organisms immobilised in cryogels showed a monolithic
      structure to PVA cryogels, and demonstrated a living, stable, photofermentative
      population after long-term immobilisation. CONCLUSION: Transparent PVA cryogels
      offer ideal properties as an immobilisation matrix for phototrophic bacteria and 
      present a low-cost photobioreactor technology for the further advancement of
      biohydrogen from waste as a sustainable energy source, as well as development of 
      alternative photo-bioprocesses exploiting the unique capabilities of purple
      non-sulfur bacteria.

TI  - Dark co-fermentation of rice straw and pig manure for biohydrogen production:
      effects of different inoculum pretreatments and substrate mixing ratio.
PG  - 4539-4549
LID - 10.1080/09593330.2020.1770340 [doi]
AB  - Biohydrogen produced from agricultural waste through dark co-fermentation is an
      increasingly valuable source of renewable energy. Rice straw (RS) and pig manure 
      (PM) are widely available waste products in Asia with complementary levels of
      carbon and nitrogen that together have a high biohydrogen production potential.
      However, no research has yet determined the ideal inoculum pretreatment method
      and mixing ratio for biohydrogen production using these resources. In this study,
      we tested biohydrogen production using three different inoculum pretreatment
      methods (acid, alkali and thermal) at five RS/PM ratios (1:0, 5:1, 3:1, 1:1 and
      0:1, based on total solids). All three pretreatments promoted biohydrogen
      production with the increase of bioactivity of biohydrogen-producing organisms
      (compared with a control group), though acid was clearly superior to thermal or
      alkali. Using acid pretreatment and RS/PM ratio of 5:1 corresponded with a
      relatively low NH4+-N concentration (655.17 mg/L), a maximal cumulative
      biohydrogen production of 44.59 mL/g VSadded with a low methane production
      (<0.1%), a large butyric acid accumulation (1035.30 mg/L) and a biohydrogen
      conversion rate of 2.12%. The optimal pH for biohydrogen production from
      co-fermentation of RS and PM ranged from 5.0-5.5.

TI  - Enhanced biohydrogen production from cotton stalk hydrolysate of Enterobacter
      cloacae WL1318 by overexpression of the formate hydrogen lyase activator gene.
PG  - 94
LID - 10.1186/s13068-020-01733-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Biohydrogen production from lignocellulose has become an important
      hydrogen production method due to its diversity, renewability, and cheapness.
      Overexpression of the formate hydrogen lyase activator (fhlA) gene is a promising
      tactic for enhancement of hydrogen production in facultative anaerobic
      Enterobacter. As a species of Enterobacter, Enterobacter cloacae was reported as 
      a highly efficient hydrogen-producing bacterium. However, little work has been
      reported in terms of cloning and expressing the fhlA gene in E. cloacae for
      lignocellulose-based hydrogen production. RESULTS: In this study, the formate
      hydrogen lyase activator (fhlA) gene was cloned and overexpressed in Enterobacter
      cloacae WL1318. We found that the recombinant strain significantly enhanced
      cumulative hydrogen production by 188% following fermentation of cotton stalk
      hydrolysate for 24 h, and maintained improved production above 30% throughout the
      fermentation process compared to the wild strain. Accordingly, overexpression of 
      the fhlA gene resulted in an enhanced hydrogen production potential (P) and
      maximum hydrogen production rate (R m), as well as a shortened lag phase time
      (lambda) for the recombinant strain. Additionally, the recombinant strain also
      displayed improved glucose (12%) and xylose (3.4%) consumption and hydrogen yield
      Y(H2/S) (37.0%) compared to the wild strain. Moreover, the metabolites and
      specific enzyme profiles demonstrated that reduced flux in the competitive
      branch, including succinic, acetic, and lactic acids, and ethanol generation,
      coupled with increased flux in the pyruvate node and formate splitting branch,
      benefited hydrogen synthesis. CONCLUSIONS: The results conclusively prove that
      overexpression of fhlA gene in E. cloacae WL1318 can effectively enhance the
      hydrogen production from cotton stalk hydrolysate, and reduce the metabolic flux 
      in the competitive branch. It is the first attempt to engineer the fhlA gene in
      the hydrogen-producing bacterium E. cloacae. This work provides a highly
      efficient engineered bacterium for biohydrogen production from fermentation of
      lignocellulosic hydrolysate in the future.

AB  - Biological hydrogen production by microalgae is a potential sustainable,
      renewable and clean source of energy. However, many barriers limiting
      photohydrogen production in these microorganisms remain unsolved. In order to
      explore this potential and make biohydrogen industrially affordable, the
      unicellular microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is used as a model system to
      solve barriers and identify new approaches that can improve hydrogen production. 
      Recently, Chlamydomonas-bacteria consortia have opened a new window to improve
      biohydrogen production. In this study, we review the different consortia that
      have been successfully employed and analyze the factors that could be behind the 
      improved H2 production.

TI  - Development of novel strategies for higher fermentative biohydrogen recovery
      along with novel metabolites from organic wastes: The present state of the art.

AB  - Depletion of fossil fuels and environmental concern has compelled us to search
      for alternative fuel. Hydrogen is considered as a dream fuel as it has high
      energy content (142 kJ g(-1) ) and is not chemically bound to carbon. At present,
      fossil fuel-based methods for producing hydrogen require high-energy input, which
      makes the processes expensive. The major processes for biohydrogen production are
      biophotolysis, microbial electrolysis, dark fermentation, and photofermentation. 
      Fermentative hydrogen production has the additional advantages of potentially
      using various waste streams from different industries as feedstock. Novel
      strategies to enhance the productivity of fermentative hydrogen production
      include optimization in pretreatment methods, integrated fermentation systems
      (sequential and combined fermentation), use of nanoparticles as additives,
      metabolic engineering of microorganisms, improving the light utilization
      efficiency, developing more efficient photobioreactors, etc. More focus has been 
      given to produce biohydrogen in a biorefinery approach in which, along with
      hydrogen gas, other metabolites (ethanol, butyric acid, 1,3-propanediol, etc.)
      are also produced, which have direct/indirect industrial applications. In present
      review, various emerging technologies that highlight biohydrogen production
      methods as effective and sustainable methods on a large scale have been
      critically reviewed. The possible future developments are also outlined.

AB  - To better clarify the effect of lighting and mixing on the hydrogen production
      from agricultural waste, experiments under diverse constant and dynamic light
      intensities and mixing speeds were conducted. Cumulative hydrogen yield, hydrogen
      production rate, OD660, pH, reducing sugar concentration were monitored. Results 
      showed that mixing had positive effects on high substrate concentration. The
      interaction between lighting and mixing was drawn. Higher light intensity (7000
      Lux) was suitable for hydrogen production under mixing. Higher light intensity
      with higher mixing speed (150 RPM) showed the highest cumulative hydrogen yield
      of 78.1 mL/g TS. Different periods of hydrogen production process required
      distinct lighting and mixing. Combined with Gompertz model, dynamic lighting and 
      mixing strategies were discussed. Dynamic light intensity (4000-7000-4000 Lux)
      accompanied with dynamic mixing speed (50-150-50 RPM) was the optimal condition
      for PFHP. Highest hydrogen yield of 84.7 mL/g TS and highest light conversion
      efficiency of 36.32% were obtained.

AB  - In this work, the influence of batch, semi-continuous and continuous mode on
      biohydrogen production from dark fermentation effluents (DFEs) as substrate and
      electron distribution was investigated. Results indicated a better H2 production 
      performance was obtained in semi-continuous mode. 50% decanting volume ratio
      (DVR) and 24 h feeding interval time (FIT) were found to be the best condition.
      Maximum average H2 production rate (HPR) and H2 yield were obtained of 8.44 mL/h 
      and 1386.22 +/- 44.23 mL H2/g TOC, respectively. 37.71% substrate electrons
      partitioning to hydrogen were detected. For continuous mode, more substrate
      electrons were diverted toward SMPs with the increasing of HRT due to the fact
      that longer cell retention, more chances were provided for cell lysis. The bad
      performance in batch mode ascribed to 56.39% substrate electrons were transferred
      to cell growth and soluble microbial products (SMPs).

TI  - Distillers' dried grains with solubles (DDGS) and its potential as fermentation
      feedstock.

LID - 10.1007/s00253-020-10682-0 [doi]
AB  - Distillers' dried grain with solubles (DDGS) is a byproduct of bioethanol
      fermentation, which uses the dry milling technology for starch-rich grains such
      as corn, wheat, and barley. The current interest in bioethanol is increasing due 
      to the need for renewable liquid fuels specifically in the transportation sector.
      Since DDGS is rich in crude protein, fat, fiber, vitamins, and minerals, it is
      currently used as aquaculture, livestock, and poultry feeds. In recent years,
      DDGS has been used as feedstock in the production of value-added products via
      microbial fermentation. Numerous studies reported the production organic acids,
      methane, biohydrogen, and hydrolytic enzymes using DDGS. While DDGS contains
      remarkable amounts of macronutrients, pre-treatment of DDGS is required for
      release of the fermentable sugars. The pre-treatment methods such as chemical,
      physical, and biological origin are either solely used or combined to obtain
      maximal yields for different applications. Therefore, this review summarizes some
      of the most prominent pre-treatment processes generating high fermentable sugar
      yields for the productions of value-added products in the last 5 years. A special
      focus has been given to the effect of the variability of DDGS on the final
      product. Integration of hydrolytic enzyme production with the traditional
      bioethanol production facilities has been discussed for further improvement of
      bioethanol, methane, and biohydrogen using DDGS as fermentation feedstock.Key
      points* Distillers' dried grain with solubles (DDGS) has high nutritional value, 
      but the nutritional profile is variable.* DDGS can be used for microbial
      fermentation feedstock to produce value-added products.* A review of the
      microbial products using DDGS is given for the last 5 years.* DDGS has the
      potential to replace expensive feedstocks of value-added products.

AB  - In the present study the bioconversion of dried household food waste (FORBI) to
      energy carriers was investigated aiming to its sustainable management and
      valorization. FORBI was either directly fermented towards ethanol and hydrogen or
      was previously subjected to extraction with water resulting to a liquid fraction 
      (extract) rich in sugars and a solid residue, which were then fermented
      separately. Subsequently, the effluents were assessed as substrates for methane
      production via anaerobic digestion (AD). Mono-cultures and co-cultures of C5 and 
      C6 yeasts were used for the alcoholic fermentation whereas for the production of 
      hydrogen, mixed acidogenic consortia were used. Taking into account the optimum
      yields of biofuels, the amount of recoverable energy was estimated based for each
      different approach. The maximum ethanol yield was 0.16 g ethanol per kg of FORBI 
      and it was achieved for separate fermentation of liquid and solid fractions of
      the waste. The highest hydrogen yield that was observed was 210.44 L +/- 4.02
      H2/kg TS FORBI for 1% solids loading and supplementation with cellulolytic
      enzymes. Direct AD of either the whole FORBI or its individual fractions led to
      lower overall energy recovery, compared to that obtained when fermentation and
      subsequent AD were applied. The recoverable energy was estimated for the
      different exploitation approaches of the waste. The maximum achieved recoverable 
      energy was 21.49 +/- 0.57 MJ/kg.

AB  - Renewable energy can assist the management of the effects of population growth
      and rapid economic development on the sustainability of animal husbandry. The
      primary aim of renewable energy is to minimize the use of fossil fuels via the
      creation of environmentally friendly energy products from depleted fossil fuels. 
      Digesters that treat swine manure are extensively used in treatment systems; and 
      inclusion of swine carcasses can increase the organic loading rate (OLR) thereby 
      improving biogas yield and productivity on farms. However, the characteristics of
      the components including animal residues, proteins, lipids, remains of undigested
      feed items, antimicrobial drug residues, pathogenic microorganisms and nutrient
      contents, are complex and diverse. It is therefore necessary to manage the
      anaerobic process stability and digestate purification for subsequent use as
      fertilizer. Efficient methane recovery from residues rich in lipids is difficult 
      because such residues are only slowly biodegradable. Pretreatment can promote
      solubilization of lipids and accelerate anaerobic digestion, and pretreatments
      can process the swine carcass before its introduction onto biodigesters. This
      review presents an overview of the anaerobic digestion of swine manure and
      carcasses. We analyze the characteristics of these residues, and we identify
      strategies to enhance biogas yield and process stability. We consider energy
      potential, co-digestion of swine manure and carcasses, physical, chemical, and
      biological pretreatment of biomass, sanitary aspects of swine manure and
      co-digestates and their recycling as fertilizers.

TI  - Biodegradable and non-biodegradable fraction of municipal solid waste for
      multifaceted applications through a closed loop integrated refinery platform:
      Paving a path towards circular economy.

AB  - An increase in population, rapid urbanization and industrialization has
      accelerated the rate of municipal solid waste generation. The current disposal of
      solid waste is a burgeoning issue and it's in immediate need to shift the
      existing disposal processes to a sustainable manner. Circular economy (CE) is a
      conceptual model which is been used for better use of resources and minimization 
      of waste in a closed loop approach which could be appropriate for waste
      management. In this context, the present review illustrates the effective use of 
      biodegradable and non-biodegradable fraction of solid waste in a closed loop
      integrated refinery platforms for the recovery of bioenergy resources and for the
      production of value added products. The biodegradable fraction of solid waste
      could be treated by advanced biological processes with the simultaneous
      production of bioenergy such as biohydrogen, biomethane, bioelectricity, etc.,
      and other value added products like butanol, ethanol, methanol etc. The scheme
      illustrates the closed loop approach, the bioenergy generated from the
      biodegradable fraction of solid waste could be used for the operation of internal
      combustion engines and the energy could be further used for processing the waste.
      The non-biodegradable fraction of solid waste could be used for construction and 
      pavement processes. Overall the study emphasizes the paradigm shift of solid
      waste management concepts from linear economy to a circular economy following the
      "Zero Waste" concept. The study also explains the circular economy policies
      practiced for solid waste management that stimulates the economy of the country
      and identify the pathways to maximize the local resources. In addition the review
      addresses the advanced information and communication technologies to unfold the
      issues and challenges faced in the solid waste management. The smart governance
      of managing waste using the "Internet of Things" (IoT) is one of the great
      precursors of technological development that could lead innovations in waste
      management.

AB  - Wheat straw was pretreated with either CaO2 or CaO to improve biohydrogen
      production. Both CaO and CaO2 pretreatments improved the biodegradability of the 
      wheat straw. CaO pretreatment raised the H2 yield by between 48.8 and 163.9% at
      CaO contents ranging from 2 to 4%. The highest H2 yield [144 mL/g total solid
      (TS)] was obtained at 121 degrees C and 6% CaO. In addition, the highest H2 yield
      from wheat straw pretreated at the same temperature and dosage of CaO2 was 71.8
      mL/g TS, which was higher than that of the control group (43.2 mL/g TS), with hot
      water (121 degrees C) treatment. Considering pretreatment costs and H2 production
      potential, CaO was a better pretreatment agent than CaO2.

AB  - Perceiving and detecting a sustainable source of energy is very critical issue
      for current modern society. Hydrogen on combustion releases energy and water as a
      byproduct and has been considered as an environmental pollution free energy
      carrier. From the last decade, most of the researchers have recommended hydrogen 
      as one of the cleanest fuels and its demand is rising ever since. Hydrogen having
      the highest energy density is more advantageous than any other fuel. Hydrogen
      obtained from the fossil fuels produces carbon dioxide as a byproduct and creates
      environment negative effect. Therefore, biohydrogen production from green algae
      and cyanobacteria is an attractive option that generates a benign renewable
      energy carrier. Microalgal feedstocks show a high potential for the generation of
      fuel such as biohydrogen, bioethanol and biodiesel. This article has reviewed the
      different methods of biohydrogen production while also trying to find out the
      most economical and ecofriendly method for its production. A thorough review
      process has been carried out to study the methods, enzymes involved, factors
      affecting the rate of hydrogen production, dual nature of algae, challenges and
      commercialization potential of algal biohydrogen.

AB  - In the present study, isolation and identification of hydrogen producing strains 
      from sugar and food industry wastewater were reported. From 48 isolates in both
      the wastewater, initial batch studies led to the use of four effective strains,
      which were identified using 16S rRNA gene sequencing as Bacillus
      thuringiensis-FH1, Comamonas testosteroni-FB1, Klebsiella pneumoniae-FA2 and
      Bacillus cereus-SB2, respectively. Further optimization studies were done at
      various pH values (5-8) and wastewater concentrations (10-100%). In the optimized
      batch experimentation, K. pneumoniae-FA2 excelled with the maximum cumulative
      hydrogen production of 880.93 +/- 44.0 mL/L. A 3 L bioreactor was employed for
      effective hydrogen production, which conferred that K. pneumoniae-FA2, surpassed 
      the other three with the maximum hydrogen yield of 3.79 +/- 0.04 mol H2/mol

AB  - Redox potential is one of the key regulators in determining the fate of the
      metabolic pathways of biocatalysts and of their associated product synthesis in
      microbial electrochemical systems. In the present study, the influence of applied
      potentials on fermentation products and metabolic flux was investigated using
      isolated E. coli HP3 as a model organism using pyruvate as a substrate. To
      provide insights into metabolic shifts, electro-fermentative (EF) systems were
      constructed and poised at both positive and negative redox potentials of 0.2 V,
      0.4 V, 0.6 V and 0.8 V (vs Ag/AgCl) at the anode. The relative expression of
      genes encoding lactate dehydrogenase (ldhA), pyruvate formate lyase (pflB),
      pyruvate dehydrogenase (aceF), hydrogenase (hycE) and NADH: oxidoreductase (nuoB)
      enabled assessment of metabolic shifts in addition to cyclic voltammograms and
      short chain fatty acid profiling. Results showed that poised conditions had a
      significant effect on product formation and observed up-regulation of key enzymes
      involved in pyruvate metabolism in comparison to controls. More specifically, EF 
      poised at -0.8 V and -0.2 V enhanced H2 production by 7.9 folds and 5.3 folds
      respectively, whilst at +0.8 V poised operation enhanced lactate production by
      1.9 folds compared to the control. Concomitantly, the key genes involved in the
      pathway for H2 production viz., plfB, hycE and nuoB were all up-regulated
      significantly in a reactor poised at -0.8 V compared with other conditions.
      Similarly, transcripts for gene ldhA were up-regulated significantly in the
      system poised with +0.8 V. The study elucidated the role of redox potential on
      the product formation with respect to the relative expression of the genes
      encoding key enzymes in the metabolic pathway in correlation with
      bio-electrochemical characteristics.

TI  - Hydrogen production driven by formate oxidation in Shewanella oneidensis MR-1.
PG  - 5579-5591

AB  - Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 is a potent hydrogen producer in the deficiency of
      exogenous electron acceptors. The electron transfer pathway for hydrogen
      production remains unclear, although enzymes for hydrogen production have been
      identified in S. oneidensis MR-1. In this study, we investigated the electron
      transfer pathway from formate to hydrogen, given that formate is commonly a key
      chemical for bacterial hydrogen production. We revealed that two formate
      dehydrogenases FdhA1B1C1 and FdhA2B2C2, rather than FdnGHI, played a dominant
      role in formate-driven hydrogen production. Menaquinone was indispensable for the
      electron transfer from formate to hydrogen, which excluded the presence of
      formate hydrogen-lyase in S. oneidensis MR-1. A previously proposed formate
      dehydrogenase subunit HydC was identified as a menaquinone-binding subunit of
      [FeFe] hydrogenase HydAB, and the hydABC operon is conserved in bacteria living
      in diverse environments. A formate exporter FocA and transcriptional regulator
      FhlA were identified for their effect on formate metabolism and hydrogen
      production. FhlA positively affected the metabolism of formate and hydrogen by
      regulating the expression of fdhA2B2C2, fdnGHI, focA, and dld-II. Overall, the
      electron transfer pathway deciphered in this work will facilitate the improvement
      of biohydrogen production by S. oneidensis MR-1.Key Points* The electron transfer
      pathway from formate to hydrogen in MR-1 is deciphered.* Menaquinone is
      indispensable for hydrogen production.* A cytochrome b subunit transfers
      electrons from menaquinone to [FeFe] hydrogenase.

AB  - Biohydrogen production was evaluated using cassava processing wastewater (CPW)
      and two microbial consortia (Vir and Gal) from different Brazilian environments. 
      The biohydrogen production was optimized using a Box-Behnken design (T, pH, C/N, 
      and % v/v inoculum). Maximum yields were obtained with hydrolyzed substrate: 4.12
      and 3.80 mol H2 / for Vir and Gal, respectively. Similarly, the kinetic
      parameters micro, k, and q were higher with hydrolyzed CPW in both consortia. The
      molecular analysis of the consortia through Illumina high-throughput sequencing
      showed the presence of bacteria from the families Porphyromonadaceae,
      Clostridiaceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Enterococcaceae. The relative abundance of
      microbial families varies as fermentation progresses. In both consortia,
      Clostridiaceae reached the maximum relative abundance in the media between 16 and
      24 h, interval in which approximately 90% of the biohydrogen is generated.

AB  - Hydrogen is already a major commodity and process intermediate for fertilizer
      production, petroleum processing, and chemical synthesis. It also offers
      unrealized potential for energy storage. While biological production offers an
      expandable and sustainable source, enthusiasm has been dampened by slow research 
      progress. Also, the very low cost of natural gas (the major current hydrogen
      source) imposes severe economic challenges. This discussion describes process,
      metabolic, and protein engineering opportunities toward cost-effective
      biohydrogen production. Recent progress in hydrogenase engineering and
      photosynthetic bacterial research now suggests a favorable risk versus reward
      opportunity. Although the risks are still significant, successful technologies
      would provide important components in an integrated energy portfolio that enables
      global sustainability.

AB  - This study examined the effect of shear velocity on biohydrogen producing dynamic
      membrane bioreactor (DMBR) containing 50 microm polyester mesh as supporting
      material. Increase of shear velocity up to 6.75 m/h enhanced hydrogen production 
      performance as well as biomass retention in both suspended and attached forms,
      while wash-out was found at a shear velocity of 11.69 m/h. The highest average
      HPR, HY, suspended biomass, and attached biomass were 26.56 +/- 1.49 L/L-d, 1.78 
      +/- 0.10 mol H2/mol glucoseadded, 9.99 +/- 0.11 g VSS/L, and 8.82 g VSS/L,
      respectively, at a shear velocity of 6.75 m/h. Flux balance analysis showed
      homoacetogenic pathway decreased at the shear velocity of 4.70 m/h with the
      increase of hydrogen yield based on consumed substrate. The highest copy numbers 
      of Clostridium butyricum was found at the optimum shear velocity. Shear velocity 
      would be a critical operational criteria for continuous biohydrogen production
      using DMBR.

AB  - A new biorefinery conceptual process is proposed for biohydrogen and biomethane
      production from a combination of fruits and vegetable wastes (FVW) and corn
      stover (CS). The objective of this work was to perform the acid hydrolysis (HCl
      0.5% v/v, 120 degrees C, 2 h) of the FVW and CS at 3:1 dry basis ratio, and to
      process its main physical phases, liquid hydrolyzates (LH) and hydrolyzed solids 
      (HS), by mesophilic dark fermentation (DF) and anaerobic digestion (AD),
      respectively. In DF of LH as carbon source, hydrogen was produced at maximum rate
      of 2.6 mL H2/(gglucose h) and maximum accumulation of 223.8 mL H2/gglucose,
      equivalent to 2 mol H2/molglucose, in a butyric-pathway-driven fermentation. HS
      were digested to methane production assessing inoculum to substrate ratios in the
      range 2-4 ginoculum/gVS. The main results in AD were 14 mmol CH4/gvs. The
      biorefinery demonstrated the feasibility to integrate the acid hydrolysis as
      pretreatment and subsequently use the LH for hydrogen production, and the HS for 
      methane production, with an energy yield recovery of 9.7 kJ/gvs, being the energy
      contribution from anaerobic digestion 8-fold higher than of dark fermentation.

AB  - Recent advances on biohydrogen production using different types of waste biomass 
      with the implementation of nanomaterials are summarized. Inspired by exceptional 
      physicochemical and catalytic properties of nanomaterials, the present review
      focuses on several approaches including impact of nanomaterials on cellulosic
      biohydrogen production, possible pretreatment technology, as well as improved
      enzyme & sugar production in order to enhance the biohydrogen yield.
      Particularly, impacts of nanomaterial are elaborated in detail on different
      pathways of biohydrogen production (e.g. dark fermentation, photo-fermentation
      and hybrid-fermentation) using variety of waste biomass. Additionally, emphases
      are made on the feasibility of nanomaterials for making the biohydrogen
      production process more economical and sustainable and hence to develop advanced 
      techniques for biohydrogen production using waste biomass.

AB  - Dependence on fossil fuels such as oil, coal and natural gas are on alarming
      increase, thereby causing such resources to be in a depletion mode and a novel
      sustainable approach for bioenergy production are in demand. Successful
      implementation of zero waste discharge policy is one such way to attain a
      sustainable development of bioenergy. Zero waste discharge can be induced only
      through the conversion of organic wastes into bioenergy. Waste management is
      pivotal and considering its importance of minimizing the issue and menace of
      wastes, conversion strategy of organic waste is effectively recommended. Present 
      review is concentrated on providing a keen view on the potential organic waste
      sources and the way in which the bioenergy is produced through efficient
      conversion processes. Biogas, bioethanol, biocoal, biohydrogen and biodiesel are 
      the principal renewable energy sources. Different types of organic wastes used
      for bioenergy generation and its sources, anaerobic digestion-biogas production
      and its related process affecting parameters including fermentation,
      photosynthetic process and novel nano-inspired techniques are discussed.
      Bioenergy production from organic waste is associated with mitigation of lump
      waste generation and its dumping into land, specifically reducing all hazards and
      negativities in all sectors during waste disposal. A sustainable bioenergy sector
      with upgraded security for fuels, tackles the challenging climatic change problem
      also. Thus, intensification of organic waste conversion strategies to bioenergy, 
      specially, biogas and biohydrogen production is elaborated and analyzed in the
      present article. Predominantly, persistent drawbacks of the existing organic
      waste conversion methods have been noted, providing consideration to economic,
      environmental and social development.

AB  - This study aims to investigate the efficacy of lipid induction in Scenedesmus
      abundans by adding the effluent from dark fermentation of biohydrogen production.
      Four sets of experiments were conducted: control (sufficient nitrogen), nitrogen 
      depletion, low concentration (0.3x) effluent addition, and high concentration
      (0.5x) effluent addition. The addition of low concentration effluent produced the
      highest biomass and lipid yields of 2.831 g/L and 1.238 g/L, corresponding to a
      lipid abundance of 43.72 wt%. Furthermore, S. abundans had high removal
      efficiencies for volatile fatty acids in the effluent (formic acid 100%, acetic
      acid 100%, propionic acid 98%, lactic acid 84%, and butyric acid 68%), and this
      is the first study demonstrating the ability of S. abundans in using formic acid 
      and lactic acid to produce biomass and lipids. These results show that S.
      abundans have great abilities in simultaneous reducing organic acids in the
      effluent and producing valuable metabolites.

AB  - This study evaluated a novel three-stage process devoted to the cascade
      production of lactate, biohydrogen and methane from tequila vinasse (TV), with
      emphasis on attaining a high and stable biohydrogen production rate (HPR) by
      utilizing lactate as biohydrogen precursor. In the first stage, tailored
      operating conditions applied to a sequencing batch reactor were effective in
      sustaining a lactate concentration of 12.4 g/L, corresponding to 89% of the total
      organic acids produced. In the second stage, the stimulation of lactate-centered 
      dark fermentation which entails the decoupling of biohydrogen production from
      carbohydrates utilization was an effective approach enabling stable biohydrogen
      production, having HPR fluctuations less than 10% with a maximum HPR of 12.3
      L/L-d and a biohydrogen yield of 3.1 L/LTV. Finally, 1.6 L CH4/L-d and 6.5 L
      CH4/LTV were obtained when feeding the biohydrogen fermentation effluent to a
      third methanogenic stage, yielding a global energy recovery of 267.5 kJ/LTV.

AB  - Considering the future energy demand and pollution to the environment,
      biohydrogen, a biofuel, produced from biological sources have garnered increased 
      attention. The present review emphasis the various techniques and methods
      employed to enumerate the microbial community and enhancement of hydrogen
      production by dark fermentation. Notably, molecular techniques such as terminal
      restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP), quantitative real-time PCR
      (q-PCR), fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH), denaturing gradient gel
      electrophoresis (DGGE), ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (RISA), and next
      generation sequencing (NGS) have been extensively discussed on identifying the
      microbial population in hydrogen production. Further, challenges and merits of
      the molecular techniques have been elaborated.

AB  - The main aim of this work was investigating the potential of sulfonated graphene 
      oxide (sGO) for hydrolysis of cellulosic substrates and dark fermentative
      hydrogen production from obtained hydrolysates using E. aerogenes. Sulfonation of
      graphene oxide was performed using chlorosulfonic acid which showed a high acid
      density of 4.63 mmol/g. Influence of the reaction time (1-5 h), temperature
      (90-180 degrees C) and sGO dosage (62.5-500 mg in 25 mL reaction volume) on the
      hydrolysis of pretreated microcrystalline cellulose was experimented. It revealed
      that the yield of glucose and total reducing sugars and selectivity can reach
      454.4 +/- 22.20 mg/g, 682.6 +/- 30.67 mg/g and 95.5%, respectively, at 150
      degrees C for 3 h using 250 mg sGO. The maximum hydrogen efficiency of 150.0 +/- 
      5.65 mL/g was achieved under optimized conditions, which was 2.2-fold higher than
      that from the pretreated MCC substrate as control in the absence of sGO (67.3 +/-
      8.84 mL/g).

AB  - Low hydrogen yield was the bottleneck of dark fermentative hydrogen production.
      To solve this problem, the effects of rice straw-derived biochar on hydrogen
      production was investigated in different fermentation types. Ethanol-type and
      butyrate-type fermentations, two dominant types of dark fermentation, were
      carried out in batch fermentations with different concentrations of biochar. The 
      results revealed that 3 g/L was the best concentration for both types of
      fermentations. Hydrogen production increased by 118.4% and 79.6% in ethanol-type 
      and butyrate-type fermentations, respectively. The maximal hydrogen yields of
      ethanol-type and butyrate-type fermentations were 1.34 and 2.36 mol/mol-glucose, 
      respectively. The addition of biochar buffered the broth pH, lowered the redox
      potential, and released mineral nutrients. The porosity of biochar boosted cell
      immobilization and thus improved the H2 productivity. This study demonstrated the
      enhancement effect of biochar on ethanol- and butyrate-type fermentative hydrogen
      productions, and enhanced the understanding of the functional mechanisms of
      biochar.

TI  - Hyperthermophilic hydrogen production in a simplified reaction medium containing 
      onion wastes as a source of carbon and sulfur.

AB  - In this study, the hyperthermophilic dark fermentation of onion wastes (OW) for
      hydrogen production was investigated. OW were used at different proportions in
      mixed fruit and vegetable wastes (FVW) to evaluate their effect on hydrogen
      production by Thermotoga maritima. Fermentations were performed in a
      pH-controlled batch stirred tank reactor (BSTR) using seawater as a simplified
      reaction medium. Results showed that increasing OW proportions in total fruit and
      vegetable wastes (tFVW) improved H2 production. Therefore, increasing the OW to
      tFVW ratio from 0 to 0.8 increased the cumulative H2 production from 109 to 223.6
      mmol/L. The H2 productivity was also improved from 7.3 to 28.82 mmol/h.L. In
      fact, OW contain carbohydrates, sulfur compounds, and other nutrients, which were
      used as a carbon source and energetic substrate for H2 production by the
      halophilic bacterium T. maritima in seawater without additional chemical
      compounds. Then, a H2 yield of 3.36 mol H2/mol hexose was achieved using 200 mL
      of OW, containing 55 mmol/L of carbohydrates. A concept of H2 production from FVW
      at high proportions of OW in a simplified reaction medium was proposed. It
      allowed a H2 yield of 209 LH2/kg volatile solids which could be an interesting
      future alternative to the current fossil fuel.

AB  - Starch agricultural leftover is a potential substrate for photosynthetic bacteria
      to produce hydrogen. In this work, the effect of initial pH on photo-fermentation
      biohydrogen production process and electron balance were investigated. The
      modified Gompertz model was adopted, and hydrogen yield, sugar consumption and
      metabolite evolution were monitored with initial pH varying from 5 to 9. Results 
      showed that hydrogen was produced mainly through acetic acid and butyric acid
      metabolism pathways when starch taken as carbon source. It was found that the
      maximum hydrogen yield (642 +/- 22 mL) and highest hydrogen production rate
      (77.78 mL/(L.h)) were obtained at initial pH of 7. 37.65% substrates electrons
      diverted towards hydrogen. Lower hydrogen yield, hydrogen production rate and
      lower electrons diversion were obtained at other initial pH levels. Also, the lag
      phase time was 0.04 h when pH was 7, which was significantly lower than other
      levels.

AB  - The main aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the initial pH
      values of the buffer on photo-fermentation biohydrogen production. Hydrogen
      production and the kinetics of it under different initial pH values were
      analyzed. Effects of initial pH values on reducing sugar consumption, hydrogen
      production rate, and byproduct production were evaluated at initial pH values of 
      5-7. The results showed that initial pH values of phosphate buffer had a
      significant effect on biohydrogen production via photo-fermentation. With the
      initial pH value of phosphate buffer at 6.0, the cumulative hydrogen production
      reached its maximum, 569.6 mL. The maximum hydrogen production rate was 23.96
      mL/h at the initial pH value of 6.5. With the initial pH values at 5.0 and 7.5,
      the maximum hydrogen production rates were becoming lower, only 5.59 mL/h and
      5.42 mL/h, respectively. And with the increase in pH values, the peak period of
      hydrogen production was gradually delayed, indicating that the alkaline
      environment had a negative effect on the ability of photosynthetic bacteria. This
      study revealed the influence of phosphate buffer initial pH values on the
      biohydrogen production via photo-fermentation and aimed to provide a scientific
      reference for further improving the theory and technology for biohydrogen
      production from biomass.

AB  - The potential of low-cost bioenergy recovery from peanut shell was limited for
      its complex cellulose structure. In order to enhance the total reducing sugar
      (TRS) yield for bio-H2 production, peanut shell with heat (HT, 50-100 degrees C) 
      or freezing pretreatment (FT, -80 to 0 degrees C) under different duration
      (0.5-12 h) was investigated. For uncovering the enhancement mechanisms,
      morphological feature and crystalline structure were analyzed by scanning
      electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). The optimal
      pretreatment of 50 degrees C for 12 h was obtained with TRS yield increased
      73.6%, while the H2 yield of 1.25 ml/mg-TRS was peaked with pretreatment at -80
      degrees C. The SEM and XRD further demonstrated that mechanisms of HT and FT were
      realized through different ways, which were cracking and collapsing in HT, and
      delamination and peeling in FT, respectively.

AB  - Energy grass is an ideal raw material of biomass energy, and hydrogen energy is
      one of the ideal renewable energy. In order to study the feasibility of different
      energy grasses for hydrogen production from photosynthetic organisms, the
      enzymatic hydrolysis of energy grasses is a very necessary process. Therefore,
      biohydrogen production from photo-fermentation by using energy grasses as
      substrates was investgated by changing enzymolysis time. The hydrogen production 
      results were evaluated by the experimental results of hydrogen yield, hydrogen
      production rate and hydrogen production efficiency. The experimental results
      showed that Medicago sativa L. with enzymolysis time of 60 h had the highest
      hydrogen yield, which was 147.64 mL. The highest hydrogen production rate was
      5.53 mL/(h.g TS), which was obtained from Arundo donax with enzymolysis time of
      36 h, and the highest hydrogen production efficiency was 1.15 mL/(h.g TS), which 
      was obtained from Miscanthus with enzymolysis time of 0 h.

AB  - In this work, two commercialized anion-exchange membranes (AEMs), AMI-7001 and
      AF49R27, were applied in microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) and compared with a 
      novel AEM (PSEBS CM DBC, functionalized with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane) to
      produce biohydrogen. The evaluation regarding the effect of using different AEMs 
      was carried out using simple (acetate) and complex (mixture of acetate, butyrate 
      and propionate to mimic dark fermentation effluent) substrates. The MECs equipped
      with various AEMs were assessed based on their electrochemical efficiencies, H2
      generation capacities and the composition of anodic biofilm communities. pH
      imbalances, ionic losses and cathodic overpotentials were taken into
      consideration together with changes to substantial AEM properties (particularly
      ion-exchange capacity, ionic conductivity, area- and specific resistances) before
      and after AEMs were applied in the process to describe their potential impact on 
      the behavior of MECs. It was concluded that the MECs which employed the PSEBS CM 
      DBC membrane provided the highest H2 yield and lowest internal losses compared to
      the two other separators. Therefore, it has the potential to improve MECs.

AB  - Studying biohydrogen production from alfalfa is of practical significance to
      cleaner production and biomass utilization. The performances of biohydrogen
      production through active/passive saccharification and photo-fermentation were
      compared. The effects of initial pH, substrate concentration, and cellulase
      loading on biohydrogen production from alfalfa by photosynthetic bacteria HAU-M1 
      were presented. It was found that the maximum hydrogen yield of 55.81 mL/g was
      achieved at initial pH of 6.90, substrate concentration of 31.23 g/mL, and
      cellulase loading of 0.13 g/g. Hydrogen yield of active saccharification and
      photo-fermentation was much higher as compare to passive saccharification and
      photo-fermentation. Initial pH value showed a more significant influence on
      photosynthetic bacteria in comparison to cellulase in active saccharification and
      photo-fermentation biohydrogen production. The low yield of propionic acid
      suggested that it was an efficient photosynthetic hydrogen production.
      Photo-fermentation hydrogen production from alfalfa provides a novel path for
      efficient utilization of alfalfa.

AB  - The current review explores the potential application of algal biomass for the
      production of biofuels and bio-based products. The variety of processes and
      pathways through which bio-valorization of algal biomass can be performed are
      described in this review. Various lipid extraction techniques from algal biomass 
      along with transesterification reactions for biodiesel production are briefly
      discussed. Processes such as the pretreatment and saccharification of algal
      biomass, fermentation, gasification, pyrolysis, hydrothermal liquefaction, and
      anaerobic digestion for the production of biohydrogen, bio-oils, biomethane,
      biochar (BC), and various bio-based products are reviewed in detail. The
      biorefinery model and its collaborative approach with various processes are
      highlighted for the production of eco-friendly, sustainable, and cost-effective
      biofuels and value-added products. The authors also discuss opportunities and
      challenges related to bio-valorization of algal biomass and use their own
      perspective regarding the processes involved in production and the feasibility to
      make algal research a reality for the production of biofuels and bio-based
      products in a sustainable manner.

AB  - The present fossil fuel-based energy sector has led to significant industrial
      growth. On the other hand, the dependence on fossil fuels leads to adverse impact
      on the environment through releases of greenhouse gases. In this scenario, one
      possible substitute is biohydrogen, an eco-friendly energy carrier as high-energy
      produces. The substrates rich in organic compounds like organic waste/wastewater 
      are very useful for improved hydrogen generation through the dark fermentation.
      Thus, this review article, initially, the status of biohydrogen production from
      organic waste and various strategies to enhance the process efficiency are
      concisely discussed. Then, the practical confines of biohydrogen processes are
      thoroughly discussed. Also, alternate routes such as multiple process integration
      approach by adopting biorefinery concept to increase overall process efficacy are
      considered to address industrial-level applications. To conclude, future
      perspectives besides with possible ways of transforming dark fermentation
      effluent to biofuels and biochemicals, which leads to circular bioeconomy, are
      discussed.

AB  - A cost-effective and environmentally friendly method for biofuel production was
      developed, by utilizing duckweed as feedstock for biohydrogen production through 
      dark fermentation and simultaneously using the fermentative waste to produce
      microalgal lipids. The results suggested that acid hydrolysis (1% H2SO4) was more
      suitable for the pretreatment of duckweed biomass. Maximum hydrogen production of
      169.30 mL g(-1) dry weight was determined under a temperature of 35 degrees C and
      an initial pH of 7.0. After the dark fermentation, the volatile fatty acids
      (VFAs) including acetate and butyrate, were detected in the waste, with
      concentration determined as 1.04 g L(-1) and 1.52 g L(-1), respectively. During
      the mixotrophic cultivation of Chlorella sacchrarophila FACHB-4 using waste as
      feedstock, the maximum microalgal biomass and the lipid productions were about
      2.8 and 33 times higher with respect to the autotrophic growth. The simultaneous 
      biohydrogen production and waste utilization method provided a green strategy for
      biofuel production.

AB  - Biohydrogen production potential (BHP) depends on several factors like inoculum
      source, substrate, pH, among many others. Batch assays are the most common
      strategy to evaluate such parameters, where the comparison is a challenging task 
      due to the different procedures used. The present method introduces the first
      internationally validated protocol, evaluated by 8 independent laboratories from 
      5 different countries, to assess the biohydrogen potential. As quality criteria, 
      a coefficient of variation of the cumulative hydrogen production (H max) was
      defined to be <15 %. Two options to run BHP batch tests were proposed; a manual
      protocol with periodic measurements of biogas production, needing conventional
      laboratory materials and analytical equipment for biogas characterization; and an
      automatic protocol, which is run in a device developed for online measurements of
      low biogas production. The detailed procedures for both protocol options are
      presented, as well as data validating them. The validation showed acceptable
      repeatability and reproducibility, measured as intra- and inter-laboratory
      coefficient of variation, which can be reduced up to 9 %.

AB  - The energy demand has increased exponentially worldwide owing to the continuously
      growing population and urbanization. The conventional fossil fuels are unable to 
      satiate this requirement causing price inflation and significant environmental
      damage due to unrestrained emission of greenhouse gases. The focus now has
      shifted towards alternative, economical, renewable and green sources of energy
      such as hydrogen to deal with this bottle-neck. Hydrogen is a clean energy-source
      having high energy content (122 kJ/g). Recently, biological methods for the
      hydrogen production have attracted much attention because traditional methods are
      expensive, energy-exhaustive and not eco-friendly. The employment of biological
      methods promises utilization of waste or low-value materials for producing energy
      and building waste-to-energy nexus. Around 94% of the waste is discarded
      precariously in India and waste generation is growing at an alarming rate of 1.3%
      per year. The "waste-to-energy" techniques follow 'Reuse, Reduce, Recycle,
      Recovery and Reclamation' system solving three subjects at once;
      waste-management, energy-demand and environmental concern. Moreover, these
      methods have easy operability, cost-effectiveness and they help to shift from
      linear to circular model of economy for sustainable development. Biological
      processing of waste materials like agricultural discard (lignocellulosic
      biomass), food-waste and industrial discharge can be used for biohydrogen
      production. Dark and photo fermentation are the chief biological processes for
      the transformation of organic substrates to hydrogen. Dark fermentation is the
      acidogenic fermentation of carbohydrate-rich materials without light and oxygen. 
      Clostridia, Enterobacter and Bacillus spp. are appropriate heterotrophic bacteria
      for dark fermentation. Various pretreatment methods like heat treatment, acid or 
      base treatment, ultrasonication, aeration, electroporation, etc., can be applied 
      on inoculums to increase H2 producing bacteria eventually improving the hydrogen 
      yield. However, only around 33% of COD in organic materials is transformed to H2 
      by this method. Photofermentation by the photosynthetic non-sulfur bacteria (PNS)
      converts organic substrate to H2 and CO2 in the presence of nitrogenase enzyme in
      ammonium-limited and anoxygenic conditions. Rhodobacter or Rhodopseudomonas
      strains have been widely examined in this regard. But these methods are only able
      to produce H2 with a poor yield. Combining dark and photofermentation is a
      noteworthy alternative for procuring enhanced hydrogen yields. Two-stage
      sequential method utilizes volatile fatty acids accumulated as byproducts after
      dark fermentation (in the first stage) for photofermentation by suitable bacteria
      (in the second stage). A proper investigation of the dark fermenter effluents is 
      required before using them as a substrate for photo-fermentation. In a
      single-stage dark and photofermentation, co-culture of anaerobic and PNS bacteria
      in a single reactor is carried out for obtaining improved yield. The single stage
      system is comparatively inexpensive and less laborious; moreover, a limited
      requirement for an intermediate dilution stage is necessary. Economic analysis of
      hydrogen production showed that H2 production by the present methods, save
      pyrolysis, is reasonably higher than the conventional approaches of fuel
      production. Probable routes to make H2 production more cost-effective are
      reducing the cost of photobioreactor, installing proper storage system, etc. A
      constructive effort in the area of research and development of biological
      approaches of H2 production technologies is vital. The commercial viability of
      biohydrogen production is imperative for accomplishment of circular economy
      system and sustainable development.

AB  - Biohydrogen is a plausible alternative fuel solution for the contemporary issues 
      regarding global warming and the steadily increasing greenhouse gas emissions,
      because of its high energy content and carbon-free combustion properties.
      Hydrogen does not exist in its natural state and the current hydrogen production 
      technologies (steam methane reforming, water splitting) are energy-intensive,
      accompanied by a huge carbon footprint. Dark fermentative hydrogen production by 
      anaerobic hydrogen-producing bacteria is a green, sustainable and emission-free
      pathway for hydrogen production. Microalgal biomass is considered as the third
      generation biofuel feedstock and is receiving academic and industrial research
      attention for its carbon sequestration abilities. This review discusses in detail
      about the pretreatment methods that could be adapted for microalgal biomass for
      effective biohydrogen production. Microalgal cell wall structure and the
      associated polymeric carbohydrates that offer certain recalcitrance are
      critically analyzed and future research perspectives are presented.

AB  - Biohydrogen production via dark fermentation is currently the most developed
      method considering its practical readiness for scale-up. However, technological
      issues to be resolved are still identifiable and should be of concern,
      particularly in terms of internal mass transfer. If sufficient liquid-to-gas H2
      mass transfer rates are not ensured, serious problems associated with the
      recovery of biohydrogen and consequent inhibition of the process can occur.
      Therefore, the continuous and effective removal of H2 gas is required, which can 
      be performed using gas separation membranes. In this review, we aim to analyze
      the literature experiences and knowledge regarding mass transfer enhancement
      approaches and show how membranes may contribute to this task by simultaneously
      processing the internal (headspace) gas, consisting mainly of H2 and CO2.
      Promising strategies related to biogas recirculation and integrated schemes using
      membranes will be presented and discussed to detect potential future research
      directions for improving biohydrogen technology.

AB  - Anabaena variabilis is a diazotrophic filamentous cyanobacterium that
      differentiates to heterocysts and produces hydrogen as a byproduct. Study on
      metabolic interactions of the two differentiated cells provides a better
      understanding of its metabolism especially for improving hydrogen production. To 
      this end, a genome-scale metabolic model for Anabaena variabilis ATCC 29413,
      iAM957, was reconstructed and evaluated in this research. Then, the model and
      transcriptomic data of the vegetative and heterocyst cells were applied to
      construct a regulated two-cell metabolic model. The regulated model improved
      prediction for biomass in high radiation levels. The regulated model predicts
      that heterocysts provide an oxygen-free environment and then, this model was used
      to find strategies for improving hydrogen production in heterocysts. The
      predictions indicate that the removal of uptake hydrogenase improves hydrogen
      production which is consistent with previous empirical research. Furthermore, the
      regulated model proposed activation of some reactions to provide redox cofactors 
      which are required for improving hydrogen production up to 60% by bidirectional
      hydrogenase.

AB  - The cleanest form of energy, i.e., biohydrogen, and advanced biofuel, i.e.,
      biobutanol, were produced from the organic fraction of municipal solid waste
      (OFMSW). Ethanol as a byproduct of this process was used for the pretreatment of 
      this substrate, and this pretreatment was improved by other process byproducts,
      i.e., acetic acid and butyric acid. The pretreatment was conducted with 85%
      ethanol and 0-1% (w/w) acetic/butyric acid at 120 and 160 degrees C for 30 min.
      The pretreatment catalyzed by 1% (w/w) acetic acid at 120 degrees C resulted in a
      hydrolysate with 49.8 g/L total fermentable sugars, which was fermented to the
      highest overall yield of acetone, butanol, and ethanol (ABE) and hydrogen.
      Through this process, 114.1 g butanol, 43.8 g acetone, 15.1 g ethanol, 97.5 L
      hydrogen were obtained from each kg of OFMSW, producing 270 g ABE and 151 L H2
      from each kg of substrate, corresponding to 6000 kJ energy production.

AB  - The operation of bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) relies on the ability of
      microbes to export electrons outside of their cells. However, microorganisms are 
      not evolutionary conceived to power BESs as most of the redox processes occur
      within. In this study, a low cost strategy equivalent to the one used to improve 
      hydrogen production is employed to divert electrons from the metabolism to an
      electrode. Varying the ratio of nitrogen to carbon concentration (0, 0.20 and
      0.54) determines what fraction of the electron flux is directed towards
      biosynthesis, biohydrogen generation and extracellular electron transfer. The
      ratio of 0.54 produced a higher specific growth rate while the ratio of 0.20
      resulted in combined higher maximum specific hydrogen production and
      exoelectrogenic activity, translating into a maximum power density of 2.39 +/-
      0.13 mW m(-2) in a novel hybrid hydrogen-photosynthetic microbial fuel cell. The 
      current work sets a framework for the optimisation of R. palustris for bioenergy 
      recovery.

AB  - This study proposes the supplementation of digestate, fresh organic fraction of
      municipal solid waste (OFMSW) and a nutrient solution during the anaerobic
      biostimulation of marine sediments contaminated by polycyclic aromatic
      hydrocarbons (PAHs). The experimental activity was conducted with four PAHs (i.e.
      phenanthrene, anthracene, fluoranthene and pyrene) under controlled mesophilic
      conditions (37 +/- 1 degrees C) in 100 mL serum bottles maintained at 130 rpm.
      After 120 days of incubation, the highest total PAH degradation of 53 and 55% was
      observed in the experiments with digestate + nutrients and OFMSW + nutrients,
      respectively. Phenanthrene was the most degraded PAH and the highest removal of
      69% was achieved with OFMSW + nutrients. The anaerobic PAH degradation proceeded 
      through the accumulation of volatile fatty acids and the production of hydrogen
      and methane as biogas constituents. The highest cumulative biohydrogen production
      of 80 mL H2.g VS(-1) was obtained when OFMSW was used as the sole amendment,
      whereas the highest biomethane yield of 140 mL CH4.g VS(-1) was obtained with
      OFMSW + nutrients. The evolution of PAH removal during anaerobic digestion
      revealed a higher impact of the methanogenic phase rather than acidogenic phase
      on PAH degradation.

AB  - Hydrogen gas represents a promising alternative energy source to dwindling fossil
      fuel reserves, as it carries the highest energy per unit mass and its combustion 
      results in the release of water vapour as only byproduct. The facultatively
      anaerobic thermophile Parageobacillus thermoglucosidasius is able to produce
      hydrogen via the water-gas shift reaction catalyzed by a carbon monoxide
      dehydrogenase-hydrogenase enzyme complex. Here we have evaluated the effects of
      several operating parameters on hydrogen production, including different growth
      temperatures, pre-culture ages and inoculum sizes, as well as different pHs and
      concentrations of nickel and iron in the fermentation medium. All of the tested
      parameters were observed to have a substantive effect on both hydrogen yield and 
      (specific) production rates. A final experiment incorporating the best scenario
      for each tested parameter showed a marked increase in the H2 production rate
      compared to each individual parameter. The optimised parameters serve as a strong
      basis for improved hydrogen production with a view of commercialisation of this
      process.

AB  - This work aimed to compare the environmental impact and energy performance of
      rice husk utilization for biohydrogen production via different pathways using
      parameters and processes applicable in Southeast Asian countries. Six scenarios
      were developed by combining each selected biohydrogen production process -
      electrolysis, gasification and dark fermentation, with different energy
      production technology. The emission values and energy demand varies depending on 
      the scenarios studied, highlighting the effect of different efficiencies of each 
      biohydrogen production technology. The dark fermentation route has the least
      environmental impact and the highest energy conversion efficiency. Rice husk used
      in a co-generation plant to supply process energy creates a purely green
      technology. Biomass energy ratio provides a basis for the performance of each
      pathway in terms of the conversion efficiency, emissions and energy demand. The
      sensitivity analysis is used to identify key parameters and processes to improve 
      the dark fermentation technology.

      pretreated Alternanthera philoxeroides by mutant Enterobacter aerogenes ZJU1.

AB  - Alternanthera philoxeroides, a notorious invasive aquatic weed, is a typical
      lignocellulosic feedstock for fermentative biohydrogen production. To improve the
      dark fermentation performance, steam-heated acid pretreatment and enzymolysis
      were employed to release reducing sugars from A. philoxeroides, and Enterobacter 
      aerogenes ZJU1 mutagenized by (60)Co-gamma irradiation was used as the inoculum. 
      Dilute acid accompanied by steam heating significantly disrupted the fiber
      structures of A. philoxeroides. Scanning electron microscopic images revealed
      that many pores and fissures were generated in the surface of A. philoxeroides
      after pretreatment. X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
      analyses showed that the pretreatment facilitated the transformation of cellulose
      I to cellulose II in A. philoxeroides biomass, resulting in the increase of
      amorphous regions and the decrease of crystallinity. Under the optimum
      pretreatment condition (1.0 v/v% H2SO4, 135 degrees C for 15 min), the reducing
      sugar yield reached 0.354 g/g A. philoxeroides, which was further increased to
      0.575 g/g A. philoxeroides after enzymolysis. The biohydrogen yield increased by 
      59.9% from 38.9 mL/g volatile solids (VS) of raw A. philoxeroides to 62.2 mL/gVS 
      of the pretreated one. As compared to the wild strain, E. aerogenes ZJU1
      contributed to an increase of 31.8% in the biohydrogen yield from pretreated A.
      philoxeroides. Further optimization of bacteria suspensions significantly
      increased the maximum biohydrogen production rate from 1.42 to 4.64 mL/gVS/h,
      advanced the biohydrogen production peak, and resulted in an increase of 42.8% in
      biohydrogen yield to 89.8 mL/gVS.

AB  - Low H2 yield from biomass impedes the industrial application of biohydrogen
      production. To improve H2 yield, the effect of Ginkgo biloba leaf (GL) on H2
      production was investigated in this study. In batch fermentation with sugarcane
      molasses (SM), the addition of GL improved H2 yield by 28.03%. SM medium was
      optimized with response surface methodology (RSM) to determine the best
      concentrations of GL, SM, and an inexpensive nitrogen source-corn steep liquor
      (CSL). A maximum yield of 1.58 mol-H2/mol-hexose from SM was obtained when GL,
      CSL and SM hexose were 2.31 g/L, 2.28 g/L and 10 g/L, respectively. As observed
      with metabolic flux analysis, GL enhanced H2 conversion from SM via altering the 
      metabolic flux distribution of E. harbinense from ethanol pathway towards acetate
      pathway. This study demonstrated the promotion effect of GL on H2 production from
      SM, raising a novel method for enhanced biohydrogen production in large scales.

TI  - Elimination of the flavodiiron electron sink facilitates long-term H2
      photoproduction in green algae.
PG  - 280
LID - 10.1186/s13068-019-1618-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The development of renewable and sustainable biofuels to cover the
      future energy demand is one of the most challenging issues of our time.
      Biohydrogen, produced by photosynthetic microorganisms, has the potential to
      become a green biofuel and energy carrier for the future sustainable world, since
      it provides energy without CO2 emission. The recent development of two
      alternative protocols to induce hydrogen photoproduction in green algae enables
      the function of the O2-sensitive [FeFe]-hydrogenases, located at the acceptor
      side of photosystem I, to produce H2 for several days. These protocols prevent
      carbon fixation and redirect electrons toward H2 production. In the present work,
      we employed these protocols to a knockout Chlamydomonas reinhardtii mutant
      lacking flavodiiron proteins (FDPs), thus removing another possible electron
      competitor with H2 production. RESULTS: The deletion of the FDP electron sink
      resulted in the enhancement of H2 photoproduction relative to wild-type C.
      reinhardtii. Additionally, the lack of FDPs leads to a more effective obstruction
      of carbon fixation even under elongated light pulses. CONCLUSIONS: We
      demonstrated that the rather simple adjustment of cultivation conditions together
      with genetic manipulation of alternative electron pathways of photosynthesis
      results in efficient re-routing of electrons toward H2 photoproduction.
      Furthermore, the introduction of a short recovery phase by regular switching from
      H2 photoproduction to biomass accumulation phase allows to maintain cell fitness 
      and use photosynthetic cells as long-term H2-producing biocatalysts.

PG  - 134005
LID - 10.1088/1361-6528/ab5f78 [doi]
AB  - Combining abiotic photosensitisers such as quantum dots (QDs) with
      non-photosynthetic bacteria presents an intriguing concept into the design of
      artificial photosynthetic organisms and solar-driven fuel production. Shewanella 
      oneidensis MR-1 (MR-1) is a versatile bacterium concerning respiration,
      metabolism and biocatalysis, and is a promising organism for artificial
      photosynthesis as the bacterium's synthetic and catalytic ability provides a
      potential system for bacterial biohydrogen production. MR-1's hydrogenases are
      present in the periplasmatic space. It follows that for photoenergised electrons 
      to reach these enzymes, QDs will need to be able to enter the periplasm, or
      electrons need to enter the periplasm via the Mtr pathway that is responsible for
      MR-1's extracellular electron transfer ability. As a step towards this goal,
      various QDs were tested for their photo-reducing potential, nanotoxicology and
      further for their interaction with MR-1. CdTe/CdS/TGA, CdTe/CdS/Cysteamine, a
      commercial, negatively charged CdTe and CuInS2/ZnS/PMAL QDs were examined. The
      photoreduction potential of the QDs was confirmed by measuring their ability to
      photoreduce methyl viologen with different sacrificial electron donors. The
      commercial CdTe and CuInS2/ZnS/PMAL QDs showed no toxicity towards MR-1 as
      evaluated by a colony-forming units method and a fluorescence viability assay.
      Only the commercial negatively charged CdTe QDs showed good interaction with
      MR-1. With transmission electron microscopy, QDs were observed both in the
      cytoplasm and periplasm. These results inform on the possibilities and
      bottlenecks when developing bionanotechnological systems for the photosynthetic
      production of biohydrogen by MR-1.

AB  - The aim of this review is to summarize the modern developments and enhancement
      strategies reported for improving the biorefinery route of industrial wastewater 
      to biohydrogen. Recent developments towards biohydrogen production chiefly
      involves culture enrichment, pretreatment of biocatalysts, co culture
      fermentation, metabolic and genetic engineering, ecobiotechnological approaches
      and the coupling process of biohydrogen. In addition, an overview of dark
      fermentation, pathways involved, microbes involved in biohydrogen production,
      industrial wastewater as substrate have been focused. The utilization of organic 
      residuals of dark fermentation for subsequent value added products are
      highlighted. More apparently, the two stage coupling process and its
      possibilities towards biorefinery has been reviewed comprehensively. Moreover,
      comparative energy and economic aspects of biohydrogen production from industrial
      wastewater and its prospects towards pilot scale applications are also
      spotlighted. Though all the enhancement strategies have both benefits and
      disadvantages, coupling process is considered as the most successful biorefinery 
      route for biohydrogen production.

AB  - Hydrogen-producing mixed cultures were subjected to a 48-h downward or upward
      temperature fluctuation from 55 to 35 or 75 degrees C. Hydrogen production was
      monitored during the fluctuations and for three consecutive batch cultivations at
      55 degrees C to evaluate the impact of temperature fluctuations and
      bioaugmentation with synthetic mixed culture of known H2 producers either during 
      or after the fluctuation. Without augmentation, H2 production was significantly
      reduced during the downward temperature fluctuation and no H2 was produced during
      the upward fluctuation. H2 production improved significantly during temperature
      fluctuation when bioaugmentation was applied to cultures exposed to downward or
      upward temperatures. However, when bioaugmentation was applied after the
      fluctuation, i.e., when the cultures were returned to 55 degrees C, the H2 yields
      obtained were between 1.6 and 5% higher than when bioaugmentation was applied
      during the fluctuation. Thus, the results indicate the usefulness of
      bioaugmentation in process recovery, especially if bioaugmentation time is
      optimised.

AB  - Because of their biofuel producing capabilities, algae (including microalgae and 
      cyanobacteria) are effective and sustainable tools to attain energy security with
      a growing world population and for reduction of our current reliance on fossil
      fuels. Algal metabolic and genetic engineering could provide substantial
      advancements in producing novel and promising strains for the production of
      alternative biofuels. In this review, we have highlighted biotechnological
      strategies for microalgae and cyanobacteria that target the improvement of: (1)
      biosynthesis of biofuel precursors (fatty acid, TAGs, and lipids etc.), (2)
      carbon-capture ability to accumulate more lipids, and (3) engineering
      hydrogenases for augmented production of biohydrogen. Other strategies for
      improving quality and quantity of algal biofuels are also explored.

AB  - Depletion of fossil fuel sources and their emissions have triggered a vigorous
      research in finding alternative and renewable energy sources. In this regard,
      algae are being exploited as a third generation feedstock for the production of
      biofuels such as bioethanol, biodiesel, biogas, and biohydrogen. However, algal
      based biofuel does not reach successful peak due to the higher cost issues in
      cultivation, harvesting and extraction steps. Therefore, this review presents an 
      extensive detail of deriving biofuels from algal biomass starting from various
      algae cultivation systems like raceway pond and photobioreactors and its
      bottlenecks. Evolution of biofuel feedstocks from edible oils to algae have been 
      addressed in the initial section of the manuscript to provide insights on the
      different generation of biofuel. Different configuration of photobioreactor
      systems used to reduce contamination risk and improve biomass productivity were
      extensively discussed. Photobioreactor performance greatly relies on the
      conditions under which it is operated. Hence, the importance of such conditions
      alike temperature, light intensity, inoculum size, CO2, nutrient concentration,
      and mixing in bioreactor performance have been described. As the lipid is the
      main component in biodiesel production, several pretreatment methods such as
      physical, chemical and biological for disrupting cell membrane to extract lipid
      were comprehensively reviewed and presented. This review article had put forth
      the recent advancement in the pretreatment methods like hydrothermal processing
      of algal biomasses using acid or alkali. Eventually, challenges and future
      dimensions in algal cultivation and pretreatment process were discussed in detail
      for making an economically viable algal biofuel.

TI  - An innovative multistage anaerobic hythane reactor (MAHR): Metabolic flux,
      thermodynamics and microbial functions.

AB  - Biohythane production from wastewater via anaerobic fermentation currently relies
      on two-stage physically separated biohydrogen and biomethane reactors, which
      requires closed monitoring, the implementation of a control system, and
      cost-intensive, complex operation. Herein, an innovative multistage anaerobic
      hythane reactor (MAHR) was reported via integrating two-stage fermentation into
      one reactor. MAHR was constructed using an internal down-flow packed bed reactor 
      and an external up-flow sludge blanket to enhance microbial enrichment and
      thermodynamic feasibility of the associated bioreactions. The performance of MAHR
      was investigated for 160d based on biogas production, metabolic flux and
      microbial structure in comparison to a typical anaerobic high-rate reactor
      (up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB)). A biohythane production with an
      optimized hydrogen volume ratio (10-20%) and a high methane content (75-80%) was 
      achieved in the hythane zone (MH) and methane zone (MM) in MAHR, respectively. In
      addition, MAHR showed a stronger capability to accommodate a high organic loading
      rate (120g COD/L/d), and it enhanced the conversion of organics leading to a
      methane production rate 66% higher than UASB. Thermodynamic analysis suggested
      that hydrogen extraction in MH significantly decreased the hydrogen partial
      pressure (<0.1% vol) which favored acetogenesis in MM. Metabolic flux and
      microbial function analysis further supported the superior performance of MAHR
      over UASB, which was primarily attributed to enhanced acetogenesis and
      acetoclastic methanogenesis.

AB  - The performance and microbial communities of a continuous dark fermentation
      reactor exposed to perturbations induced by substrate change and acidic pH shock 
      were investigated. A mesophilic well-mixed reactor separately fed with two types 
      of tequila vinasses (TVs) and lactose was operated at a fixed pH of 5.5, except
      during short-term pH (3.8) stress, for ~61days at decreasing hydraulic retention 
      times (HRTs) from 24 to 4h. During the first ~23days of operation with TV, a
      decrease in HRT down to 4h resulted in the highest reported biohydrogen
      productivity from TV of 12.4 NL/L-d. It was shown that abrupt change in TV type
      (even with temporal feeding of lactose) and transient over-acidification impaired
      the normal operation of the reactor. However, it rapidly recovered from such
      disturbances, sustaining similar high-rate productivity to that previously
      encountered. Recovery was attributed to resistant and resilient microbial
      community features, as supported by molecular characterisation.

AB  - The current research focuses on anaerobic respiration of arsenic and other toxic 
      metals by purple nonsulfur bacteria (PNSB). Among the optimization assays
      performed were carbon utilization, cross metal resistance, and metal respiration,
      along with a comparison of each assay in photoheterotrophic and
      chemoheterotrophic growth. The bacteria were identified by the classification of 
      16S ribosomal RNA gene sequences. Rhodobacter sp. PI3 proved to be more versatile
      in carbon source utilization (acetate, lactate, citrate, and oxalate), whereas
      Rhodopseudomonas palustris PI5 proved to be more versatile in metal resistance
      (arsenate, arsenite, cobalt, lead, selenium, and nickel). Both the strains were
      found to be positive for photofermentative hydrogen production along with arsenic
      respiration. This study reveals that anaerobic conditions are more appropriate
      for better efficiency of PNSB. Our study demonstrates that R. palustris PI5 and
      Rhodobacter sp. PI3 can be promising candidates for the biohydrogen production
      along with metal detoxification using heavy metal-polluted effluents as a
      substrate.

AB  - Several waste sources have been studied as substrate sources for the production
      of biogas rich in hydrogen and for the isolation of bacteria capable of
      fermenting several substrates for the same purpose. Nonetheless, to simplify the 
      process and minimize production costs, it is important to seek alternatives both 
      for the use of microbial consortia using crude waste and for the use of
      substrates also in their crude form, without the need for purification. The aim
      of this study was to use only waste as inoculum and substrate for the biological 
      production of hydrogen. Thus, samples from anaerobic ponds of a poultry
      slaughterhouse were used as inoculum. Sucrose, pure glycerol (in initial tests)
      and crude glycerol (inserted in blends with pure glycerol) were used as
      substrates. H2 production experiments were conducted in batches, using a reactor 
      kept in an anaerobic environment for 11 days, at 35 degrees C, under orbital
      agitation at 150 rpm. To analyse the composition of the biogas and the presence
      of soluble metabolic products (SMPs), samples of the headspace gases generated
      and of the reaction medium were collected. The results using sucrose as substrate
      indicated that the inoculum under study has potential for bio-H2 production, as
      it produced CH4-free biogas containing 50-60% H2. The inoculum was also shown to 
      be adaptable to the use of glycerine as a substrate, producing biogas with
      similar characteristics to those obtained from sucrose degradation; however, it
      required a longer acclimatization period, and thus more in-depth study is
      required.

TI  - Engineered Thermoanaerobacterium aotearoense with nfnAB knockout for improved
      hydrogen production from lignocellulose hydrolysates.
PG  - 214

AB  - BACKGROUND: As a renewable and clean energy carrier, the production of
      biohydrogen from low-value feedstock such as lignocellulose has increasingly
      garnered interest. The NADH-dependent reduced ferredoxin:NADP(+) oxidoreductase
      (NfnAB) complex catalyzes electron transfer between reduced ferredoxin and
      NAD(P)(+), which is critical for production of NAD(P)H-dependent products such as
      hydrogen and ethanol. In this study, the effects on end-product formation of
      deletion of nfnAB from Thermoanaerobacterium aotearoense SCUT27 were
      investigated. RESULTS: Compared with the parental strain, the NADH/NAD(+) ratio
      in the nfnAB mutant was increased. The concentration of hydrogen and ethanol
      produced increased by (41.1 +/- 2.37)% (p < 0.01) and (13.24 +/- 1.12)% (p <
      0.01), respectively, while the lactic acid concentration decreased by (11.88 +/- 
      0.96)% (p < 0.01) when the nfnAB mutant used glucose as sole carbon source. No
      obvious inhibition effect was observed for either SCUT27 or SCUT27/nfnAB when six
      types of lignocellulose hydrolysate pretreated with dilute acid were used for
      hydrogen production. Notably, the SCUT27/nfnAB mutant produced 190.63-209.31
      mmol/L hydrogen, with a yield of 1.66-1.77 mol/mol and productivity of
      12.71-13.95 mmol/L h from nonsterilized rice straw and corn cob hydrolysates
      pretreated with dilute acid. CONCLUSIONS: The T. aotearoense SCUT27/nfnAB mutant 
      showed higher hydrogen yield and productivity compared with those of the parental
      strain. Hence, we demonstrate that deletion of nfnAB from T. aotearoense SCUT27
      is an effective approach to improve hydrogen production by redirecting the
      electron flux, and SCUT27/nfnAB is a promising candidate strain for efficient
      biohydrogen production from lignocellulosic hydrolysates.

AB  - Mixed culture sludge has been widely used as a microbial consortium for
      biohydrogen production. Simple thermal treatment of sludge is usually required in
      order to eliminate any H2-consuming bacteria that would reduce H2 production. In 
      this study, thermal treatment of sludge was carried out at various temperatures. 
      Electron flow model was then applied in order to assess community structure in
      the sludge upon thermal treatment for biohydrogen production. Results show that
      the dominant electron sink was acetate (150-217 e- meq/mol glucose). The electron
      equivalent (e- eq) balances were within 0.8-18% for all experiments. Treatment at
      100 degrees C attained the highest H2 yield of 3.44mol H2/mol glucose from the
      stoichiometric reaction. As the treatment temperature increased from 80 to 100
      degrees C, the computed acetyl-CoA and reduced form of ferredoxin (Fdred)
      concentrations increased from 13.01 to 17.34 e- eq (1.63-2.17mol) and 1.34 to
      4.18 e- eq (0.67-2.09mol), respectively. The NADH2 balance error varied from 3 to
      10% and the term e-(Fd<-->NADH2) (m) in the NADH2 balance was NADH2 consumption
      (m=-1). The H2 production was mainly via the Fd:hydrogenase system and this is
      supported with a good NADH2 balance. Using the modified Gompertz model, the
      highest maximum H2 production potential was 1194mL whereas the maximum rate of H2
      production was 357mL/h recorded at 100 degrees C of treatment.

AB  - The study aimed to evaluate biopolymer production using two bacterial strains,
      Acinetobacter junii BP25 and Aeromonas hydrophila ATCC 7966, and their
      co-culture. Batch experiments were evaluated using acetate and butyrate as carbon
      sources in feast and famine strategy. Feast phase was studied using carbon,
      nitrates and phosphate in the ratio of 100:8:1 and famine phase was limited with 
      the phosphate and nitrates. Co-culture resulted in highest specific growth rate
      (0.30h(-1)) in the feast phase and the famine phase accounted the maximum
      polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) accumulation (2.46g PHB/L), followed by Acinetobacter
      junii BP25 (0.25h(-1) and 1.82g PHB/L) and Aeromonas hydrophila ATCC 7966
      (0.17h(-1) and 1.12g PHB/L). Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and 
      nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) structural analysis confirmed as
      PHB. PHB production using the co-culture could be integrated with biohydrogen
      process using volatile fatty acids (VFA) as a carbon source in the biorefinery
      framework.

AB  - This study focused on continuous-flow hydrogen production by Thermotoga
      neapolitana at a hydraulic retention time (HRT) decreasing from 24 to 5h. At each
      HRT reduction, the hydrogen yield (HY) immediately dropped, but recovered during 
      prolonged cultivation at constant HRT. The final HY in each operating period
      decreased from 3.4 (+/-0.1) to 2.0 (+/-0.0) mol H2/mol glucose when reducing the 
      HRT from 24 to 7h. Simultaneously, the hydrogen production rate (HPR) and the
      liquid phase hydrogen concentration (H2aq) increased from 82 (+/-1) to 192 (+/-4)
      mL/L/h and from 9.1 (+/-0.3) to 15.6 (+/-0.7) mL/L, respectively. Additionally,
      the effluent glucose concentration increased from 2.1 (+/-0.1) to above 10mM.
      Recirculating H2-rich biogas prevented the supersaturation of H2aq reaching a
      value of 9.3 (+/-0.7) mL/L, resulting in complete glucose consumption and the
      highest HPR of 277mL/L/h at an HRT of 5h.

AB  - The green microalgae Parachlorella kessleri RA-002 isolated in Armenia can
      produce biohydrogen (H2) during oxygenic photosynthesis. Addition of
      protonophores, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) and
      2,4-dinitrophenol (DNF) enhances H2 yield in P. kessleri. The maximal H2 yield of
      ~2.20 and 2.08mmolL(-1) was obtained in the presence of 15muM CCCP and 50muM DNF,
      respectively. During dark conditions H2 production by P. kessleri was not
      observed even in the presence of protonophores, indicating that H2 formation in
      these algae was mediated by light conditions. The enhancing effect of
      protonophores can be coupled with dissipation of proton motive force across
      thylakoid membrane in P. kessleri, facilitating the availability of protons and
      electrons to [Fe-Fe]-hydrogenase, which led to formation of H2. At the same time 
      H2 production was not observed in the presence of diuron
      (3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea), a specific inhibitor of PS II.
      Moreover, diuron inhibits H2 yield in P. kessleri in the presence of
      protonophores. The inhibitory effect of diuron coupled with suppression of
      electron transfer from PS II. The results showed that in these algae operates PS 
      II-dependent pathway of H2 generation. This study is important for understanding 
      of the mechanisms of H2 production by green microalgae P. kessleri and developing
      of its biotechnology.

AB  - This study reports the fabrication of a new cathode electrode assembly using
      polyaniline (PANI) and graphene on a stainless steel mesh (SSM) as an alternative
      for the conventional expensive cathode of microbial electrolysis cells (MECs).
      With respect to the previous efforts to propose an efficient and cost-effective
      alternative for platinum (Pt) catalysts and cathode electrodes, the present study
      investigates the assessment of different catalysts to elucidate the potential of 
      the modified SSM cathode electrode for larger-scale MECs. In the case of feeding 
      dairy wastewater to the MEC, the maximum hydrogen production rate and COD removal
      were obtained by SSM/PANI/graphene cathode and had the values 0.805 m(3) H2 m(-3)
      anolyte day(-1) and 82%, respectively, at the applied potential of 1 V. These
      values were only 20% and 7% lower than those of the MEC with Pt on the carbon
      cloth cathode, respectively. The coulombic efficiencies of SSM/Pt and
      SSM/PANI/graphene were seen to be 64.48% and 56.67%, respectively. It was also
      concluded that the fabrication cost of the modified cathode was 50% lower than
      the conventional cathodes with Pt on the carbon cloth. Finally, the evaluation of
      the modified cathode performance was achieved based on Fourier transform infrared
      spectroscopy, linear sweep voltammetry, scanning electron microscopy, and atomic 
      force microscopy.

AB  - Antibiotic fermentation residue produced from pharmaceutical plants has been
      listed as a "Hazardous Waste", however it contains various substrates which can
      be used for biofuel production. In this study, the possibility of biohydrogen
      production from antibiotic fermentation residue was evaluated, the process
      efficiency and microbial community dynamics with five different inoculum
      pretreatments (alkaline, gamma-radiation, heat-shock, aeration and acid) were
      assessed. Results showed that alkaline pretreatment was most efficient for
      hydrogen fermentation, and the hydrogen yield, volatile solids (VS) removal and
      maximal hydrogen production rate reached 17.8mL/g-VSadded, 17.8% and 3.79mL/h,
      respectively. Different inoculum pretreatments led to a obvious variation in the 
      fermentation pathway and microbial community structure. The highest content of
      hydrogen-producing bacteria, especially Clostridium, essentially contributed to
      the highest hydrogen fermentation efficiency for the system with alkaline
      pretreatment. This investigation suggested that antibiotic fermentation residue
      is a potential feedstock for hydrogen production through dark fermentation.

TI  - Recent Progresses in Application of Membrane Bioreactors in Production of
      Biohydrogen.
LID - E100 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/membranes9080100 [doi]
AB  - Biohydrogen is a clean and viable energy carrier generated through various green 
      and renewable energy sources such as biomass. This review focused on the
      application of membrane bioreactors (MBRs), emphasizing the combination of these 
      devices with biological processes, for bio-derived hydrogen production. Direct
      biophotolysis, indirect biophotolysis, photo-fermentation, dark fermentation, and
      conventional techniques are discussed as the common methods of biohydrogen
      production. The anaerobic process membrane bioreactors (AnMBRs) technology is
      presented and discussed as a preferable choice for producing biohydrogen due to
      its low cost and the ability of overcoming problems posed by carbon emissions.
      General features of AnMBRs and operational parameters are comprehensively
      overviewed. Although MBRs are being used as a well-established and mature
      technology with many full-scale plants around the world, membrane fouling still
      remains a serious obstacle and a future challenge. Therefore, this review
      highlights the main benefits and drawbacks of MBRs application, also discussing
      the comparison between organic and inorganic membranes utilization to determine
      which may constitute the best solution for providing pure hydrogen. Nevertheless,
      research is still needed to overcome remaining barriers to practical applications
      such as low yields and production rates, and to identify biohydrogen as one of
      the most appealing renewable energies in the future.

AB  - Hydrogenases are metalloproteins capable of catalyzing the interconversion
      between molecular hydrogen and protons and electrons. The iron-sulfur clusters
      within the enzyme enable rapid relay of electrons which are either consumed or
      generated at the active site. Their unparalleled catalytic efficiency has
      attracted attention, especially for potential use in H2 production and/or fuel
      cell technologies. However, there are limitations to using hydrogenases,
      especially due to their high O2 sensitivity. The subclass, called [FeFe]
      hydrogenases, are particularly more vulnerable to O2 but proficient in H2
      production. In this review, we provide an overview of mechanistic and protein
      engineering studies focused on understanding and enhancing O2 tolerance of the
      enzyme. The emphasis is on ongoing studies that attempt to overcome O2
      sensitivity of the enzyme while it catalyzes H2 production in an aerobic
      environment. We also discuss pioneering attempts to utilize the enzyme in
      biological H2 production and other industrial processes, as well as our own
      perspective on future applications.

AB  - In this study a two-steps bioprocess approach aimed at biohydrogen production via
      dark-fermentation, and polyhydroxyalkanoates-PHA production by mixed microbial
      cultures, was proposed to valorise two dairy-waste streams coming from cheese
      whey deproteinization (i.e. Ricotta cheese production and ultrafiltration).
      During the first step, the increase of OLR was tested, resulting in higher daily 
      H2 volume (3.47 and 5.07 NL H2 d(-1) for second cheese whey-SCW and concentrated 
      cheese whey permeate-CCWP) and organic acids production (14.6 and 12.6gL(-1)d(-1)
      for SCW and CCWP) for both the substrates, keeping good conversion of sugars into
      H2 (1.37 and 1.93mol H2 mol(-1) sugars for SCW and CCWP). During the second step,
      the organic acids were used for PHA production reaching high conversion yields
      for both the fermented streams (as average 0.74+/-0.14mg CODPHA mg(-1) CODOA-in),
      with a maximum polymer content of 62+/-4.5 and 55.1+/-1.3% (g PHA g(-1) VSS) for 
      fermented SCW and fermented CCWP respectively. For the results reported, this
      study could be taken into consideration for larger scale application.

TI  - Whey and molasses as inexpensive raw materials for parallel production of
      biohydrogen and polyesters via a two-stage bioprocess: New routes towards a
      circular bioeconomy.

AB  - Consecutive dark-fermentation and photo-fermentation stages were investigated for
      a profitable circular bio-economy. H2 photo-production versus
      poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (P3HB) accumulation is a modern biotechnological approach
      to use agro-food industrial byproducts as no-cost rich-nutrient medium in
      eco-sustainable biological processes. Whey and molasses are very important
      byproducts rich in nutrients that lactic acid bacteria can convert, by
      dark-fermentation, in dark fermented effluents of whey (DFEW) and molasses
      (DFEM). These effluents are proper media for culturing purple non-sulfur
      bacteria, which are profitable producers of P3HB and H2. The results of the
      present study show that Lactobacillus sp. and Rhodopseudomonas sp. S16-VOGS3 are 
      two representative genera for mitigation of environmental impact. The highest
      productivity of P3HB (4.445mg/(L.h)) was achieved culturing Rhodopseudomonas sp. 
      S16-VOGS3, when feeding the bacterium with 20% of DFEM; the highest H2 production
      rate of 4.46mL/(L.h) was achieved when feeding the bacterium with 30% of DFEM.

AB  - This study explored the mechanisms of the enhanced hydrogen production from
      macroalgae by Fe(2+) supplementation. Highest hydrogen yield of 19.47mL/g VSadded
      was achieved at Fe(2+) supplementation of 400mg/L, which was 6.25 times of the
      control test. In depth analysis of substrate degradation, microbial distribution 
      and metabolites formation was conducted. The results showed that
      Fe(2+)-supplemented group was dominated by Clostridium butyricum (67.2%) and
      Ruminococcus gnavus (24.2%), which stimulated hydrogen generation and volatile
      organic acids accumulation. In contrast, Fe(2+)-deficient group had a microbial
      community dominated by Exiguobacterium sp. (29.0%), Acinetobacter lwoffii (24.5%)
      and Clostridium stricto 13 (23.4%), which induced higher efficiency of both
      biomass hydrolysis and mineralization. Microbes from a single system were
      mutually cooperative, while microbes from Fe(2+)-deficient and those from
      Fe(2+)-supplemented systems were mutually exclusive. This study suggested that
      Fe(2+) is critical in macroalgae fermentation system to affect the microbial
      community structure and subsequently switch the metabolic pathways.

AB  - Batch dark fermentation tests were performed on sheep cheese whey without
      inoculum addition at different operating pHs, relating the type and production
      yields of the observed gaseous and liquid by-products to the evolution of
      fermentation. Cheese whey fermentation evolved over time in two steps, involving 
      an initial conversion of carbohydrates to lactic acid, followed by the
      degradation of this to soluble and gaseous products including short-chain fatty
      acids (mainly acetic, butyric and propionic acids) and hydrogen. The operating pH
      affected the production kinetics and yields, as well as the fermentation
      pathways. By varying the duration of the fermentation process, different cheese
      whey exploitation strategies may be applied and oriented to the main production
      of lactic acid, hydrogen or other organic acids.

AB  - Hydrogen gas (H2) is the cleanest energy carrier with 142kJ/g energy content and 
      without toxic byproducts release during combustion. There is interest to H2
      production by biological process from sustainable resources including municipal
      and industrial wastewater and also solid waste. Here, we describe the biohydrogen
      production that involves first survey the effect of alkalinity on biohydrogen
      production based on stoichiometric reaction, followed by the electron equivalent 
      balances determination and examination of prediction capability of Gamperts model
      for biohydrogen production. *The method uses a dark fermentation biological
      process for H2 production from wastewater.*As the influent alkalinity increased, 
      the hydrogen production increased and then promptly descended.*The predicted gas 
      volume, based on Gamperts model confirmed good agreement with experimental value.

AB  - This study evaluates a two-stage process by dark fermentation and microalgal
      cultivation for hydrogen and lipid production from different agricultural biomass
      residues, such as corn cob, corn stalk, rice straw and wheat straw. Results
      indicate that corn stalk was the best fermentation feedstock for hydrogen
      production and the highest accumulative hydrogen volume of 762.3mLL(-1) was
      obtained in batch mode. Dark fermentative effluent from corn stalk was rich in
      acetate and butyrate, and was favorable to lipid production. The maximum algal
      biomass and total lipid content reached 1461.1mgL(-1) and 35.2%, respectively.
      Meanwhile, the energy conversion efficiency in two-stage cultivation
      significantly increased from 5.78% to 16.96%. The system was stable and effective
      in long-term operation, and the average hydrogen production rate of
      811.1mLL(-1)d(-1) and lipid concentration of 588.5mgL(-1) were achieved. This
      study provides a promising process for enhancing energy production from
      agricultural wastes.

AB  - Rapid development of the industrial and domestic sectors has led to the rise of
      several energy and environmental issues. In accordance with sustainable
      development and waste minimization issues, biohydrogen production along with
      biomethane production via two-stage fermentation process using microorganisms
      from renewable sources has received considerable attention. In the present study,
      biohythane production with simultaneous wastewater treatment was studied in a
      two-stage (Biohydrogen and Biomethane) fermentation process under anaerobic
      conditions. Optimization of high organic content (COD) distillery spent wash
      effluent (DSPW) with dilution using sewage wastewater was carried out. Addition
      of leachate as a nutrient source was also studied for effective biohythane
      production. The experimental results showed that the maximum biohythane
      production at optimized concentration (substrate concentration of 60 g/L with 30%
      of leachate as a nutrient source) was 67 mmol/L bio-H2 and with bio-CH4
      production of 42 mmol/L. Graphical Abstract.

AB  - Biohydrogen from microalgae has attracted extensive attention owing to its
      promising features of abundance, renewable and self sustainability. Unlike other 
      well-established biofuels like biodiesel and bioethanol, biohydrogen from
      microalgae is still in the preliminary stage of development. Criticisms in
      microalgal biohydrogen centered on its practicality and sustainability. Various
      laboratory- and pilot-scale microalgal systems have been developed, and some
      research initiatives have exhibited potential for commercial application. This
      work provides a review of the state of the art of biohydrogen from microalgae.
      Discussions include metabolic pathways of light-driven transformation and dark
      fermentation, reactor schemes and system designs encompassing reactor
      configurations and light manipulation. Challenges, knowledge gaps and the future 
      directions in metabolic limitations, economic and energy assessments, and
      molecular engineering are also delineated. Current scientific and engineering
      challenges of microalgal biohydrogen need to be addressed for technology leapfrog
      or breakthrough.

AB  - Hydrogen is seen as a key element of the future energy mix because it does not
      generate greenhouse gas emissions at the point of use. Understanding the
      technologies that can generate low carbon hydrogen is essential in planning the
      development of future gas networks and energy generation via fuel cells. One
      promising approach is hydrogen production by gasification of waste, referred to
      as biohydrogen. This paper summarises work undertaken to design a commercial
      Waste-to-Hydrogen (WtH2) plant, which includes an assessment of future markets
      for hydrogen, the identification of an appropriate scale for the plants, and
      development of specifications for process design and output streams. An
      experimental programme was undertaken to demonstrate bioH2 production from refuse
      derived fuel (RDF) at pilot scale and provided experimental data to underpin
      commercial designs. On this basis, a reference design for small commercial plants
      was developed for bioH2 production for heating and transport utilisation. A
      preliminary carbon assessment shows that carbon savings for biohydrogen in a
      commercial scale are more than four times greater than alternative technologies.

AB  - Strictly anaerobic, acetogenic (acetate-forming) bacteria are characterized by a 
      reductive pathway in which two mol of CO2 are reduced to one mol of acetyl
      coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) and then further to acetate, ethanol, or butyrate.
      Therefore, they have come into focus for an alternative, CO2-based bioeconomy.
      Other one-carbon (C1) substrates, such as formic acid or methanol, are promising 
      feedstocks for an alternative bioeconomy using acetogens as biocatalysts that
      have been somewhat overlooked. In addition, acetogens, such as Acetobacterium
      woodii and Thermoanaerobacter kivui, have a unique enzyme system capable of
      reducing CO2 to formate with H2 as reductant that is superior over any chemical
      catalyst for CO2-based hydrogen storage. Therefore, acetogens are also promising 
      candidates in the hydrogen economy as potential catalysts for hydrogen storage or
      production.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Wheat straw, the most abundant lignocellulosic biomass in China, is
      rich in cellulose that can be hydrolyzed and then converted into biofuels, such
      as bioethanol and biohydrogen. However, the accessibility of cellulose and the
      enzyme activity are greatly reduced in the presence of lignin. This significantly
      increases the enzyme cost in the saccharification, which hampers industrial
      production of lignocellulosic biofuels. In this study, a laccase treatment system
      mediated by 1-hydroxybenzotriazole was employed to modify and degrade lignin to
      enhance subsequent enzymatic saccharification of wheat straw. A kinetic model
      considering enzyme adsorption on lignin was proposed to estimate the
      saccharification performance. RESULTS: Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
      (FTIR) analyses showed that the peak intensity of lignin structure
      characteristics significantly changed after laccase-mediated system (LMS)
      treatment. 2D-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses indicated that the
      aromatic ether bonds were cleaved and that guaiacyl (G) was oxidized after LMS
      treatment. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses suggested that the crystallinity of
      lignocellulose increased due to the partial degradation of lignin. As a result,
      the nonproductive adsorption of the enzyme on lignin was reduced by 28%, while
      the reducing sugar yield increased by 26%. A semi-empirical kinetic model was
      used to estimate the reducing sugar yield, the initial hydrolysis rate (K M ) and
      deactivation rate coefficient (alpha) of LMS-pretreated wheat straw were 0.157
      (h(-1)) and 0.214 (h(-1)), respectively. The model showed high accuracy
      (predicting error < 10%) for describing the behavior of laccase-treated wheat
      straw hydrolysis when the solid loading is < 5%. CONCLUSIONS: The adsorption
      ability of the enzyme to lignin was reduced after LMS pretreatment.
      Physicochemical analyses showed that the chemical groups of lignin and
      lignocellulose were changed, with the crystallinity of the lignocellulose
      increasing after LMS treatment. A semi-empirical kinetic model was proposed to
      estimate the reducing sugar yield, which showed high accuracy for predicting the 
      hydrolysis performance of laccase-treated wheat straw.

AB  - This study is a proof of concept for the synergetic biohydrogen production in
      alga-bacteria co-cultures. Algal hydrogen photoproduction was obtained in
      sugar-containing media only when the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was
      co-cultured with Pseudomonas putida (40.8ml H2.L(-1)), Escherichia coli (35.1ml
      H2.L(-1)) and Rhizobium etli (16.1ml H2.L(-1)). Hydrogen photo-production in
      these co-cultures was not only linked to the induction of hypoxia, but to the
      ability of the bacteria to produce acetic acid from sugars. Synergetic hydrogen
      production was achieved by integrating the photobiological and fermentative
      production in Chlamydomonas and Escherichia coli co-cultures supplemented with
      glucose, which resulted in 60% more H2 production than the sum of the respective 
      monocultures. This cooperation relied on the ability of the alga to consume the
      excreted bacterial acetic acid, which benefited both bacterial and algal hydrogen
      production. This knowledge may open new possibilities for the biohydrogen
      production from industrial wastes.

TI  - The hydraulic retention time influences the abundance of Enterobacter,
      Clostridium and Lactobacillus during the hydrogen production from food waste.
PG  - 138-147

AB  - The influence of hydraulic retention time (HRT) on the microbial communities was 
      evaluated in an anaerobic sequencing batch reactor (AnSBR) using organic waste
      from a restaurant as the substrate. The relationship among Lactobacillus,
      Clostridium and Bacillus as key micro-organisms on hydrogen production from
      organic solid waste was studied. The effect of the HRT (8-48 h) on the hydrogen
      production and the microbial community was evaluated. Quantitative PCR was
      applied to determine the abundance of bacteria (in particular, Enterobacter,
      Clostridium and Lactobacillus genera). An AnSBR fermentative reactor was operated
      for 111 cycles, with carbohydrate and organic matter removal efficiencies of 80
      +/- 15.42% and 22.1 +/- 4.49% respectively. The highest percentage of hydrogen in
      the biogas (23.2 +/- 11.1 %), and the specific production rate (0.42 +/- 0.16
      mmol H2 gVSadded (-1) d(-1) ) were obtained at an HRT of 48 h. The decrease in
      the HRT generated an increase in the hydrogen production rate but decreasing the 
      content of the hydrogen in the gas. HRT significantly influence the abundance of 
      Enterobacter, Clostridium and Lactobacillus during the hydrogen production from
      food waste leading the hydrogen production as well as the metabolic pathways. The
      microbial analysis revealed a direct relationship between the HRT and the
      presence of fermentative bacteria (Enterobacter, Clostridium and Lactobacillus
      genera). Clostridium sp. predominated at an HRT of 48 h, while Enterobacter and
      Lactobacillus predominated at HRTs between 8 and 24 h. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF
      THE STUDY: Significance and Impact of the Study: It was demonstrated that
      hydrogen production using food waste was influenced by the hydraulic retention
      time (HRT), and closely related to changes in microbial communities together with
      differences in metabolic patterns (e.g. volatile fatty acids, lactate, etc.). The
      decrease in the HRT led to the dominance of lactic acid bacteria within the
      microbial community whereas the increase in HRT favoured the emergence of
      Clostridium bacteria and the increase in acetic and butyric acids. Statistical
      data analysis revealed a direct relationship existing between the HRT and the
      microbial community composition in fermentative bacteria. This study provides new
      insight into the relationship between the bioprocess operation and the microbial 
      community to understand better and control the biohydrogen production.

AB  - Integration of dark- and photo-fermentation is a promising strategy to enhance
      saline wastewater treatment efficiency and biohydrogen production. In this study,
      dark- and photo-fermentative bacterial consortium was respectively enriched and
      their communities were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction-denaturing
      gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). Both consortia were mainly composed of
      hydrogen-producing strains. After the first-stage dark-fermentation, the
      following conditions were applied prior to the second-stage fermentation:
      fermentative broth pH regulation (the pH group), glucose addition (the glucose
      group), glucose addition and pH regulation (the glucose+pH group), photosynthetic
      bacteria addition (the photo group), and photosynthetic bacteria addition and pH 
      regulation (the photo+pH group), respectively. Dark fermentative broth with no
      pretreatment was used as control (the control group). Then the second stage
      began. The results showed that pH restriction had more influence than substrate
      or products restriction on dark-fermentative hydrogen production. Addition of
      photo-fermentative bacteria after dark-fermentation increased the hydrogen yield 
      (134%) and substrate utilization (67%). These findings indicated syntrophic
      interactions between dark- and photo-fermentative bacteria during the hydrogen
      production process.

AB  - An integration of bio-H2 with fungal biodiesel production process was
      investigated. Highest cumulative H2 production of 3.3+/-0.20LL(-1) was observed
      during media optimization using mixture design. Using optimized media
      composition, continuous H2 production at 0.2h(-1) dilution rate, showed highest
      H2 production rate, H2 yield and biomass yield of 1020+/-23mLL(-1)h(-1),
      2.8+/-0.1molsmol(-1) reducing sugar and 1.2+/-0.06gL(-1), respectively. Using the
      spent media generated from the dark fermentation, oleaginous yeast cultivation
      was done. Highest biomass and total lipid yield of 6.4+/-0.20gL(-1) and
      0.46+/-0.04gg(-1) was observed at initial 15%v/v inoculums strength, pH of 5,
      1.5Lmin(-1) aeration rate and 25 degrees C temperature of cultivation,
      respectively. Energy recovery improved by 90.3% in integrated process when
      compared with single stage hydrogen production.

TI  - Cheese whey to biohydrogen and useful organic acids: A non-pathogenic microbial
      treatment by L. acidophilus.
PG  - 8320

AB  - The burgeoning organic waste and continuously increasing energy demands have
      resulted in significant environmental pollution concerns. To address this issue, 
      the potential of different bacteria to produce biogas/biohydrogen from organic
      waste can be utilized as a source of renewable energy, however these pathogenic
      bacteria are not safe to use without strict contact isolation. In this study the 
      role of safe food grade lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus spp.) was
      investigated for production of biogas from cheese waste with starting hexose
      concentration 32 g/L. The bacterium Lactobacillus acidophilus was identified as
      one of the major biogas producers at optimum pH of 6.5. Further the optimum
      inoculum conditions were found to be 12.5% at inoculum age of 18 h. During the
      investigation the maximum biogas production was observed to be 1665 mL after 72
      hours of incubation at pH 6.5. The biogas production was accompanied with
      production of other valuable metabolites in the form of organic acids including
      pyruvate, propionate, acetate, lactate, formate and butyrate. Thus this research 
      is paving way for nonpathogenic production of biohydrogen from food waste.

TI  - Monitoring Biohydrogen Production and Metabolic Heat in Biofilms by Fiber Bragg
      Grating Sensors.
PG  - 7842-7849
LID - 10.1021/acs.analchem.9b01559 [doi]
AB  - A fiber Bragg grating (FBG) was created to accurately and simultaneously monitor 
      the biohydrogen and metabolic heat production in biofilms containing
      Rhodopseudomonas palustris CQK-01 photosynthetic bacteria (PSB). The proposed
      hydrogen sensor was made from an FBG unit separated into two regions by a wet
      etching process; a thin region with a diameter of 15 mum was employed to monitor 
      the temperature. A smaller region of the etched FBG with a diameter of 8.0 mum
      was coated with a 50 nm-thick Pd film by sputtering to determine the responses to
      the temperature and hydrogen concentration. To monitor the biohydrogen production
      and metabolic heat within the biofilms, three FBGs were evenly distributed in a
      polydimethylsiloxane channel (biofilm carrier) with vertical distances of 80 mum.
      In addition, the thickness, surface morphology, active biomass, and porosity of
      the biofilms were investigated. The FBG sensor can rapidly and accurately
      determine the difference in Bragg wavelength shifts caused by changes in the
      hydrogen concentration and temperature. The measured biohydrogen concentration is
      highly correlated with the real biohydrogen production with a correlation of
      0.9765. The biohydrogen production capacity of PSB in the surface layer is much
      higher than that internally because of sharp decreases in the active biomass and 
      porosity from the surface to within the biofilm. The highest biohydrogen
      concentration is obtained at 1.218 x 10(4) ppm for a biofilm thickness of 165
      mum, and the temperature difference from metabolic heat production is
      approximately 1.1 degrees C in the biofilm culture.

AB  - A lab scale bioreactor with the submerged polyester mesh of pore size 100mum, was
      used for biohydrogen production under mesophilic condition (35 degrees C). The
      reactor was continuously fed with glucose (15g/L) for 90days with a hydraulic
      retention time (HRT), ranging from 12 to 1.5h. Peak hydrogen yield (HY) was
      achieved at 3h HRT as 3.22+/-0.22mol H2/mol glucose added and the hydrogen
      production rate was achieved at 2h HRT as 54.07+/-3.69 L H2/L-d, respectively.
      When HRT was reduced to 1.5h, the hydrogen yield decreased to 1.04+/-0.44mol
      H2/mol glucose added. Washout of the hydrogen producing population and metabolic 
      flux shift to non-hydrogen producing at 1.5h HRT might have attributed to the
      lower performance of the bioreactor.

AB  - In this study, the application of liquid and dewatered digestate was compared for
      the inoculation of the anaerobic digestion (AD) process. In addition to the
      specific methanogenic activity and biohydrogen potential tests, biochemical
      methane potential assay was also conducted using four different types of
      municipal and industrial waste streams (primary sludge, thickened waste activated
      sludge, source separated organics, and cattle manure). The specific methanogenic 
      activity of the digestate cake (5.0+/-0.5mL-CH4/g-VSS.d) was higher than that of 
      the liquid digestate (3.4+/-0.2mL-CH4/g-VSS.d) for the food to microorganism
      ratio of 0.5. The BMP results also revealed that regardless of the type of the
      substrate used, the application of the digestate cake as inoculum achieved
      statistically significantly higher methane production rate compared to the
      utilization of liquid digestate, most likely due to the lower concentration of
      dissolved contents (i.e., ammonia, soluble organic matter, heavy metals, etc.) in
      the diluted digestate cake. Despite the increased process rate, no statistically 
      significant effect of the type of the inoculum was observed on the ultimate
      methane yield. The biohydrogen potential test revealed the similar performance of
      the digestate- and digestate cake-inoculated digesters in terms of biohydrogen
      and volatile fatty acids production. The findings of this study suggest that the 
      digestate cake can be used as an effective alternative to the liquid digestate
      for the inoculation of full-scale anaerobic digesters, reducing the
      transportation volume by up to 90%.

AB  - This work aimed to study biohydrogen (H2) and polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA)
      production from original hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM)-containing wastewater. 
      NH4(+)-N from HPAM hydrolysis was removed efficiently through short-cut
      nitrification and anoxic ammonia oxidation (anammox). Carbon/Nitrogen (C/N)
      ratios of effluent reached 51-97, and TOC decreased only 2%-4%, providing
      potential for subsequent H2 and PHA production. The maximum yields of H2
      (0.833mL.mg(-1)substrate) and Volatile Fatty Acid (VFA) (465mg.L(-1)) occurred at
      influent C/N ratio of 51. Substrate removal increased linearly with the
      activities of dehydrogenase and hydrogenase (R(2)>/=0.990), and H2 yield rose
      exponentially with enzyme activities (R(2)>/=0.989). The maximum PHA yield (54.2%
      VSS) occurred at the 42nd hour and influent C/N ratio of 97. PHA yield was
      positively correlated with substrate uptake. The change of H2-producing,
      PHA-accumulating and HPAM-degradating bacteria indicated that those functional
      microorganisms had synergistic effects on H2 production and substrate uptake, as 
      well as PHA accumulation and substrate uptake.

AB  - This study investigated the biohydrogen production from brewery effluents using
      free and immobilized co-culture of mutated Rhodobacter M 19 and Enterobacter
      aerogenes obtained from random mutagenesis with ultra violet (UV) and ethidium
      bromide (EtBr) treatment. The best mutant for biohydrogen production was screened
      based on the sugar utilization efficiency. Maximum hydrogen production of 87% was
      achieved with immobilized EtBr mutated co-culture. The mutant immobilized strains
      showed around 30% enhanced hydrogen production than wild strains at pH 6.9.
      Gompertz and Richard's model were used to fit the augmenting biohydrogen
      production and Logistics equation determines the fitness of biomass growth data. 
      The maximal biomass concentration of co-cultures strains was 3.145g/L with
      carrying capacity coefficient 0.137h(-1). Gompertz model showed the best fit with
      minimal error in predicting the biohydrogen potential.

AB  - This study investigated the production of biogas, volatile fatty acids (VFAs),
      and other soluble organic from lignocellulosic biomass by two microbial
      communities (i.e. rumen fluid and anaerobic sludge). Four types of abundant
      lignocellulosic biomass (i.e. wheat straw, oaten hay, lurence hay and corn
      silage) found in Australia were used. The results show that rumen microbes
      produced four-time higher VFAs level than that of anaerobic sludge reactors,
      indicating the possible application of rumen microorganism for VFAs generation
      from lignocellulosic biomass. VFA production in the rumen fluid reactors was
      probably due to the presence of specific hydrolytic and acidogenic bacteria (e.g.
      Fibrobacter and Prevotella). VFA production corroborated from the observation of 
      pH drop in the rumen fluid reactors indicated hydrolytic and acidogenic
      inhibition, suggesting the continuous extraction of VFAs from the reactor.
      Anaerobic sludge reactors on the other hand, produced more biogas than that of
      rumen fluid reactors. This observation was consistent with the abundance of
      methanogens in anaerobic sludge inoculum (3.98% of total microbes) compared to
      rumen fluid (0.11%). VFA production from lignocellulosic biomass is the building 
      block chemical for bioplastic, biohydrogen and biofuel. The results from this
      study provide important foundation for the development of engineered systems to
      generate VFAs from lignocellulosic biomass.

AB  - An innovative application of the anaerobic structured-bed reactor (AnSTBR) in
      thermophilic dark fermentation of sugarcane vinasse targeting biohydrogen (bioH2)
      production was assessed. A detailed metabolite monitoring program identified the 
      major substrates and primary metabolic pathways within the system. Increasing the
      applied organic loading rate positively affected bioH2 production, reaching
      2074NmL-H2L(-1)d(-1) and indicating an optimal load of approximately
      70kg-CODm(-3)d(-1). Controlling the fermentation pH (5.0-5.5) was the primary
      strategy to maintain bioH2-producing conditions, offsetting negative impacts
      associated with the compositional variability of vinasse. Metabolic correlations 
      pointed out lactate as the primary substrate for bioH2 production, indicating its
      accumulation as evidence of impaired reactors. The versatility of the acidogenic 
      system was confirmed by identifying three major metabolic pathways according to
      the pH, i.e., lactate-producing (pH <5.0), bioH2-/butyrate-producing (pH=5.0-5.5)
      and bioH2-producing/sulfate-reducing (pH >6.0) systems, which enables managing
      the operation of the reactors for diversified purposes in practical aspects.

TI  - Understanding the NaCl-dependent behavior of hydrogen production of a marine
      bacterium, Vibrio tritonius.
PG  - e6769
LID - 10.7717/peerj.6769 [doi]
AB  - Biohydrogen is one of the most suitable clean energy sources for sustaining a
      fossil fuel independent society. The use of both land and ocean bioresources as
      feedstocks show great potential in maximizing biohydrogen production, but sodium 
      ion is one of the main obstacles in efficient bacterial biohydrogen production.
      Vibrio tritonius strain AM2 can perform efficient hydrogen production with a
      molar yield of 1.7 mol H2/mol mannitol, which corresponds to 85% theoretical
      molar yield of H2 production, under saline conditions. With a view to maximizing 
      the hydrogen production using marine biomass, it is important to accumulate
      knowledge on the effects of salts on the hydrogen production kinetics. Here, we
      show the kinetics in batch hydrogen production of V. tritonius strain AM2 to
      investigate the response to various NaCl concentrations. The modified
      Han-Levenspiel model reveals that salt inhibition in hydrogen production using V.
      tritonius starts precisely at the point where 10.2 g/L of NaCl is added, and is
      critically inhibited at 46 g/L. NaCl concentration greatly affects the substrate 
      consumption which in turn affects both growth and hydrogen production. The
      NaCl-dependent behavior of fermentative hydrogen production of V. tritonius
      compared to that of Escherichia coli JCM 1649 reveals the marine-adapted
      fermentative hydrogen production system in V. tritonius. V. tritonius AM2 is
      capable of producing hydrogen from seaweed carbohydrate under a wide range of
      NaCl concentrations (5 to 46 g/L). The optimal salt concentration producing the
      highest levels of hydrogen, optimal substrate consumption and highest molar
      hydrogen yield is at 10 g/L NaCl (1.0% (w/v)).

AB  - The insights of nanotechnology for cellulosic biohydrogen production through dark
      fermentation are reviewed. Lignocellulosic biomass to sugar generation is a
      complex process and covers the most expensive part of cellulose to sugar
      production technology. In this context, the impacts of nanomaterial on
      lignocellulosic biomass to biohydrogen production process have been reviewed. In 
      addition, the feasibility of nanomaterials for implementation in each step of the
      cellulosic biohydrogen production is discussed for economic viability of the
      process. Numerous aspects such as possible replacement of chemical pretreatment
      method using nanostructured materials, use of immobilized enzyme for a fast rate 
      of reaction and its reusability along with long viability of microbial cells and 
      hydrogenase enzyme for improving the productivity are the highlights of this
      review. It is found that various types of nanostructured materials e.g. metallic 
      nanoparticles (Fe degrees , Ni, Cu, Au, Pd, Au), metal oxide nanoparticles
      (Fe2O3, F3O4, NiCo2O4, CuO, NiO, CoO, ZnO), nanocomposites (Si@CoFe2O4,
      Fe3O4/alginate) and graphene-based nanomaterials can influence different
      parameters of the process and therefore may perhaps be utilized for cellulosic
      biohydrogen production. The emphasis has been given on the cost issue and
      synthesis sustainability of nanomaterials for making the biohydrogen technology
      cost effective. Finally, recent advancements and feasibility of nanomaterials as 
      the potential solution for improved cellulose conversion to the biohydrogen
      production process have been discussed, and this is likely to assist in
      developing an efficient, economical and sustainable biohydrogen production
      technology.

AB  - The co-fermentation of fallen leaves and sewage sludge was performed for the
      production of hydrogen at different mixing ratios. The experimental results
      indicated that the optimal mixing ratio of sludge to leaves was 20:80 (volatile
      solids (VS) basis), and the co-fermentation process showed a synergistic effect
      on biohydrogen production at this mixing ratio. The biohydorgen yield reached
      37.8mL/g-VSadded at the mixing ratio of 20:80, which was higher compared to the
      mono-fermentation of sludge (10.3mL/g-VSadded) or the leaves (30.5mL/g-VSadded). 
      The VS removal was also highest (15.7%) at the mixing ratio of 20:80, which was
      higher compared to sludge mono-fermentation (6.2%) or leaves mono-fermentation
      (12.8%). Meanwhile, the co-fermentation process enhanced the biohydrogen
      production rate and led to a more efficient fermentation pathway. Microbial
      community analysis showed that the co-fermentation system enriched much more
      Clostridium, Bacillus and Rummeliibacillus genera, which was responsible for the 
      synergistic effect on biohydrogen production.

AB  - This study evaluated the effects of different inoculum to substrate ratios (ISRs)
      (5, 10, 15%) on hydrolysis and acidogenesis of food waste in a conventional
      leachate bed reactor (LBR-C) and a novel fractionalized LBR (LBR-F). At ISR of
      10%, LBR-C experienced clogging and thus the solid removal and VFA production
      reduced significantly. Without any clogging events at high ISR of 10%, LBR-F
      achieved significantly higher (p<0.05) VS removal of 91%, hydrolysis yield of
      837g cumulative sCOD/kg volatile solids (VS), and VFA yield of 669g COD/kg VS.
      Hydrogen yield was as high as 20m(3)/ton food waste in LBR-F. Energy balance
      indicated that the LBR-F can be energy-positive for food waste treatment with net
      energy benefit of approximately 8kWh/ton food waste treated. Considering the high
      VFA yield, the LBR-F can also be a promising food waste fermentation system for
      the biorefinery platform.

AB  - During two-stage (Acidogenesis-Methanogenesis) process, solid organics and
      gaseous by-products are usually left unused. To increase resource recovery
      efficiency, a three stage process
      (Hydrolysis/Acidogenesis-Methanogenesis-Composting) was designed. Initially,
      co-digestion of food waste (FW) and vegetable waste (VW) was carried out in Leach
      Bed Reactor (LBR) for hydrolysis and acidogenesis, followed by airlift reactor
      (ALR) for methanogenesis for 21days using two different feed stocks [2:3
      FW:VW~FVW; FW alone]. Off gas from LBR was diverted to ALR to enhance methane
      recovery. Results depicted that volatile fatty acids (VFA) and biohydrogen
      production was more for FW fed system, while methane production was higher in FVW
      fed system. Three different functional zones in three separate chambers
      significantly accelerated organic removal rate while gas diversion increased
      overall methane recovery. In third stage, residual solid organic matter from LBR 
      was subjected to aerobic composting and compost with N (%): 2.90 & 2.76; C/N
      ratio: 18.2 & 20.8 for FVW and FW was recovered. The three-stage process has
      advantages of zero waste generation and overall process stability, accounting for
      resource efficient circular loop.

AB  - This study reports engineering of a hypertransformable variant of C. pasteurianum
      for bioconversion of glycerol into hydrogen (H2). A functional glycerol-triggered
      hydrogen pathway was engineered based on two approaches: (1) increasing product
      yield by overexpression of immediate enzyme catalyzing H2 production, (2)
      increasing substrate uptake by overexpression of enzymes involved in glycerol
      utilization. The first strategy aimed at overexpression of hydA gene encoding
      hydrogenase, and the second one, through combination of overexpression of dhaD1
      and dhaK genes encoding glycerol dehydrogenase and dihydroxyacetone kinase. These
      genetic manipulations resulted in two recombinant strains (hydA(++)/dhaD1K(++))
      capable of producing 97% H2 (v/v), with yields of 1.1mol H2/mol glycerol in hydA 
      overexpressed strain, and 0.93mol H2/mol glycerol in dhaD1K overexpressed strain,
      which was 1.5 fold higher than wild type. Among two strains, dhaD1K(++) consumed 
      more glycerol than hydA(++) which proves that overexpression of glycerol enzymes 
      has enhanced glycerol intake rate.

AB  - Conversion of organic matter to biohydrogen possesses promising application
      potential. In this study, low-cost ferrihydrite nanorods were used to enhance
      hydrogen production by Clostridium pasteurianum. The maximum cumulative hydrogen 
      production and the hydrogen yield were 1.03mmol and 3.55mol H2/mol glucose,
      respectively, which were 68.9% and 15.6% higher than those of the batch groups
      without ferrihydrite addition. Moreover, in comparison with magnetite and
      hematite nanoparticles, ferrihydrite presented the best stimulation for hydrogen 
      evolution. The enhancement mechanisms were explored based on metabolic
      distribution, gene expression, enzymatic activity, and metabolite determination, 
      such as Fe(II) concentration and pH value. The potential stimulation mechanisms
      are summarized as follows: ferrihydrite improves glucose conversion efficiency
      and promotes cell growth; ferrihydrite elevates the transcripts and activity of
      hydrogenase; and ferrihydrite reduction via its buffer function could ease
      acidification. This study demonstrates that ferrihydrite addition is an effective
      and green strategy to enhance fermentative hydrogen production.

AB  - Continuous hydrogen (H2) production from individual (Stonezyme, IH) and binary
      (Celluclast-Viscozyme, BH) enzymatic hydrolysates of agave bagasse was evaluated 
      in continuous stirred-tank reactors (CSTR) and trickling bed reactors (TBR). The 
      volumetric H2 production rates (VHPR) in CSTR were 13 and 2.25L H2/L-d with BH
      and IH, respectively. Meanwhile, VHPR of 5.76 and 2.0L H2/L-d were obtained in
      the TBR configuration using BH and IH, respectively. Differences on VHPR between 
      reactors could be explained by substrate availability, which is intrinsic to the 
      growth mode of each reactor configuration; while differences of VHPR between
      hydrolysates were possibly related to the composition of enzymatic hydrolysates. 
      Furthermore, homoacetogenesis was strongly influenced by H2 and substrate
      transfer conditions. Considering VHPR, H2 yields, and costs of hydrolysis,
      hydrogen production from binary hydrolysates of agave bagasse was identified as
      the most promising alternative evaluated with scale-up potential for the
      production of energy biofuels.

AB  - The aim of this work was to study the metabolic and microbial community dynamics 
      during dark co-fermentation of 80% tequila vinasse and 20% nixtamalization
      wastewater (w/w). Batch co-fermentations were performed in a 3-L well-mixed
      reactor at 35 degrees C and pH 5.5. In correspondence to Illumina MiSeq
      sequencing and reactor monitoring, changes in metabolites and microbial
      communities were characterized by three main stages: (i) a first stage during
      which lactate and acetate producers dominated and consumed the major part of
      fermentable carbohydrates, (ii) a second stage in which lactate and acetate were 
      consumed by emerging hydrogen-producing bacteria (HPB) in correlation with bioH2 
      (100NmL/L-h or 1200NmL/Lreactor) and butyrate production, and (iii) a third stage
      during which non-HPB outcompeted HPB after bioH2 production ceased. Altogether,
      the results of this study suggest that cooperative interactions between lactate
      producers and lactate- and acetate-consuming HPB could be attributed to lactate- 
      and acetate-based cross-feeding interactions.

AB  - The distribution of internal resistance in most microbial electrolysis cells
      (MECs) remains unclear, which hinders the optimization and scaling up of the
      technology. In this study, a method for quantifying the effects of design and
      operation decisions on internal resistance was applied for the first time to
      MECs. In typical single chamber MECs with carbon cloth electrodes, the internal
      resistance was distributed as follows: 210Omegacm(2) for anode, 77Omegacm(2) for 
      cathode, and 11Omegacm(2)M for solution. While varying the spacing of the
      electrodes (<1cm) had little effect on MEC performance, inducing fluid motion
      between the electrodes decreased the internal resistance of all MEC components:
      150Omegacm(2) for anode, 47Omegacm(2) for cathode, and 5.3Omegacm(2)M for
      solution. Adjusting the anode to cathode surface area ratio, to balance the
      internal resistance distribution, resulted in a significant improvement in
      performance (47A/m(2) current density, 3.7L-H2/L-liquid volume/day). These
      results suggest that the quantification of the internal resistance distribution
      enables the efficient design and operation of MECs. The parameters obtained in
      this study were also capable of predicting the performance of MECs from some
      previous studies, demonstrating the effectiveness of this method.

AB  - In this work, effect of Fe(0) nanoparticles (Fe(0) NPs) on macroalgae
      fermentation was explored. Hydrogen production was significantly enhanced by 6.5 
      times comparing with control test, achieving 20.25mL H2/g VSadded with addition
      of 200mg/L Fe(0) NPs. In-depth analysis of substrate conversion showed that both 
      hydrogen generation and acids accumulation were promoted with Fe(0) NPs
      supplementation. Microbial analysis demonstrated that both hydrogen-producing
      strains belonging to genus Clostridium and Terrisporobacter sp. favorable for
      acids formation were enriched with Fe(0) NPs supplementation, while species
      Acinetobacter lwoffii beneficial to organics mineralization was eliminated.
      Complex substrate compositions resulted in more prevalent cooperative
      relationships among species in the system. This study suggested that Fe(0) NPs
      plays a crucial role in macroalgae fermentation by affecting the microbial
      distribution, subsequently influencing the products distribution and energy
      conversion.

AB  - Hydrogen (H2) metabolism has attracted considerable interest because the
      activities of H2-producing and consuming microbes shape the global H2 cycle and
      may have vital relationships with the global cycling of other elements. There are
      many pathways of microbial H2 emission and consumption which may affect the
      structure and function of microbial communities. A wide range of microbial groups
      employ H2 as an electron donor to catalyze the reduction of pollutants such as
      organohalides, azo compounds, and trace metals. Syntrophy coupled mutualistic
      interaction between H2-producing and H2-consuming microorganisms can transfer H2 
      and be accompanied by the removal of toxic compounds. Moreover, hydrogenases have
      been gradually recognized to have a key role in the progress of pollutant
      degradation. This paper reviews recent advances in elucidating role of H2
      metabolism involved in syntrophy and hydrogenases in environmental
      bioremediation. Further investigations should focus on the application of
      bioenergy in bioremediation to make microbiological H2 metabolism a promising
      remediation strategy.

AB  - In this work, the effects of granular activated carbon (GAC) supplementation on
      hydrogen fermentation were investigated in Clostridium butyricum. Maximum
      hydrogen production rate and ultimate hydrogen volume increased up to 1.7 and 1.9
      fold, respectively, with 1g/L GAC supplementation. Indicators of stable hydrogen 
      production, such as acetate and butyrate formation increased with increasing GAC 
      concentration. To identify the factors for hydrogen production enhancement,
      transcriptome analysis was conducted. Functional genes related to hydrogen
      production increased by GAC supplementation (1.75 fold for pfor and 1.48 fold for
      oxct). On the other hand, functional genes related to hydrogen consumption
      decreased (1.78 fold for ldh, 0.67 fold for adh, 1.64 fold for hbd, 2.4 fold for 
      crt, and 0.71 fold for buk). Considered together, these results suggested that
      GAC supplementation increased biohydrogen production by changing the metabolic
      flux associated with hydrogen production and consumption pathways.

AB  - This review analyses the relevant studies which focused on hydrogen synthesis by 
      dark fermentation of galactose from macroalgal biomass by discussing the
      inoculum-related pretreatments, batch fermentation and inhibition, continuous
      fermentation systems, bioreactor designs for continuous operation and ionic
      liquid-assisted catalysis. The potential for process development is also
      revisited and the challenges towards suppressing glucose dominance over a
      galactose-based hydrogen production system are presented. The key challenges in
      the pretreatment process aiming to achieve a maximum recovery of upgradable
      (fermentable) sugars from the hydrolysates and promoting the concomitant
      detoxification of the hydrolysates have also been highlighted. The research
      avenues for bioprocess intensification connected to enhance selective sugar
      recovery and effective detoxification constitute the critical steps to develop
      future red macroalgae-derived galactose-based robust biohydrogen production
      system.

AB  - For bio-H2 fermentation, the progress and H2 yield were significantly affected by
      culture pH. Our previous research found peanut shell powder (PSP, as
      supplementary substrate) having a buffer effect on the fermentative time
      prolongation and H2 yield enhancement. The acid buffer action (ABA), cation
      exchange capacity (CEC), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray powder
      diffraction (XRD) were employed to explore the mechanism and structure changes of
      PSP. The superior ABA (57.44+/-0.65mmol/pH-kg) and CEC (112+/-2.0cmol/kg) of PSP,
      which provided high specific surface area and amorphous content, prolonged the
      fermentative time. The acidification of volatile fatty acids on PSP was effective
      to release reducing sugar and enhance hydrogen yield through breaking
      hemicellulose and amorphous components of cellulose, and enlarging specific
      surface area. The results indicated that buffer effect and acidification on PSP
      made positive effects on prolonging fermentation time and enhancing hydrogen
      yield.

TI  - Biohydrogen production of obligate anaerobic archaeon Thermococcus onnurineus NA1
      under oxic conditions via overexpression of frhAGB-encoding hydrogenase genes.
PG  - 24
LID - 10.1186/s13068-019-1365-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The production of biohydrogen (H2) as a promising future fuel in
      anaerobic hyperthermophiles has attracted great attention because H2 formation is
      more thermodynamically feasible at elevated temperatures and fewer undesired side
      products are produced. However, these microbes require anoxic culture conditions 
      for growth and H2 production, thereby necessitating costly and time-consuming
      physical or chemical methods to remove molecular oxygen (O2). Therefore, the
      development of an O2-tolerant strain would be useful for industrial applications.
      RESULTS: In this study, we found that the overexpression of frhAGB-encoding
      hydrogenase genes in Thermococcus onnurineus NA1, an obligate anaerobic archaeon 
      and robust H2 producer, enhanced O2 tolerance. When the recombinant FO strain was
      exposed to levels of O2 up to 20% in the headspace of a sealed bottle, it showed 
      significant growth. Whole transcriptome analysis of the FO strain revealed that
      several genes involved in the stress response such as chaperonin beta subunit,
      universal stress protein, peroxiredoxin, and alkyl hydroperoxide reductase
      subunit C, were significantly up-regulated. The O2 tolerance of the FO strain
      enabled it to grow on formate and produce H2 under oxic conditions, where prior
      O2-removing steps were omitted, such as the addition of reducing agent Na2S,
      autoclaving, and inert gas purging. CONCLUSIONS: Via the overexpression of frhAGB
      genes, the obligate anaerobic archaeon T. onnurineus NA1 gained the ability to
      overcome the inhibitory effect of O2. This O2-tolerant property of the strain may
      provide another advantage to this hyperthermophilic archaeon as a platform for
      biofuel H2 production.

TI  - Removal of hydrogen sulfide from a biogas mimic by using impregnated activated
      carbon adsorbent.
PG  - e0211713
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0211713 [doi]
AB  - Adsorption technology has led to the development of promising techniques to
      purify biogas, i.e., biomethane or biohydrogen. Such techniques mainly depend on 
      the adsorbent ability and operating parameters. This research focused on
      adsorption technology for upgrading biogas technique by developing a novel
      adsorbent. The commercial coconut shell activated carbon (CAC) and two types of
      gases (H2S/N2 and H2S/N2/CO2) were used. CAC was modified by copper sulfate
      (CuSO4), zinc acetate (ZnAc2), potassium hydroxide (KOH), potassium iodide (KI), 
      and sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) on their surface to increase the selectivity of H2S
      removal. Commercial H2S adsorbents were soaked in 7 wt.% of impregnated solution 
      for 30 min before drying at 120 degrees C for 24 h. The synthesized adsorbent's
      physical and chemical properties, including surface morphology, porosity, and
      structures, were characterized by SEM-EDX, FTIR, XRD, TGA, and BET analyses. For 
      real applications, the modified adsorbents were used in a real-time 0.85 L
      single-column adsorber unit. The operating parameters for the H2S adsorption in
      the adsorber unit varied in L/D ratio (0.5-2.5) and feed flow rate (1.5-5.5
      L/min) where, also equivalent with a gas hourly space velocity, GHSV (212.4-780.0
      hour-1) used. The performances of H2S adsorption were then compared with those of
      the best adsorbent that can be used for further investigation. Characterization
      results revealed that the impregnated solution homogeneously covered the
      adsorbent surface, morphology, and properties (i.e., crystallinity and surface
      area). BET analysis further shows that the modified adsorbents surface area
      decreased by up to 96%. Hence, ZnAc2-CAC clarify as the best adsorption capacity 
      ranging within 1.3-1.7 mg H2S/g, whereby the studied extended to
      adsorption-desorption cycle.

AB  - This work aims to investigate whether and how TCC affects hydrogen production
      using both experimental and model approaches. Experimental results showed that
      the exposure of TCC not only enhanced the hydrogen production yield but also
      promoted the hydrogen yield potential and hydrogen production rate. The maximum
      hydrogen production yield and hydrogen production rate increased from 10.1+/-0.2 
      to 14.2+/-0.2mL/g VSS and 0.09 to 0.13mL/g VSS.h, respectively, when TCC level
      increased from 0 to 1403+/-150mg/kg TSS. Mechanism exploration showed that the
      presence of TCC significantly promoted the release of substances and observably
      facilitated the acidification process but seriously inhibited the methonogenesis 
      and homoacetogenesis processes. Further investigations with enzyme analysis
      revealed that TCC importantly increased the activities of acetate kinase and
      [FeFe] hydrogenase but seriously inhibited the activities of carbon monoxide
      dehydrogenase and Coenzyme F420.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study investigated the effect of organic loading rate (OLR) and 
      NaCl concentration on biohydrogen production by preheated anaerobic sludge in a
      lab scale anaerobic sequencing batch reactor (ASBR) fed with glucose during long 
      time operation. METHODS: During ASBR operation, the OLR was increased in steps
      from 0.5 to 5 g glucose/L.d and NaCl addition started at an OLR of 5 g
      glucose/L.d, to obtain NaCl concentrations in the reactor in the range of 0.5-30 
      g/L. RESULTS: With an increasing OLR from 0.5 to 5 g glucose/L.d, the biohydrogen
      yield increased and reached 0.8 +/- 0.4 mol H2/mol glucose at an OLR of 5 g
      glucose/L.d. A NaCl concentration of 0.5 g/L resulted in a higher yield of
      biohydrogen (1.1 +/- 0.2 mol H2/mol glucose). Concentrations above 0.5 g/L NaCl
      led to decreasing biohydrogen yield and the lowest yield (0.3 +/- 0.1 mol H2/mol 
      glucose) was obtained at 30 g/L of NaCl. The mass balance errors for C, H, and O 
      in all constructed stoichiometric reactions were below 5%. CONCLUSIONS: The
      modified Monod model indicated that r (H2)max and Ccrit values were 23.3 mL H2/g 
      VSS/h and 119.9 g/L, respectively. Additionally, ASBR operation at high
      concentrations of NaCl shifted the metabolic pathway from acidogenic toward
      solventogenic.

AB  - Co-fermentation of garden waste (GW) and food waste (FW) was assessed in a
      two-stage process coupling hyperthermophilic dark-fermentation and mesophilic
      anaerobic digestion (AD). In the first stage, biohydrogen production from
      individual substrates was tested at different volatile solids (VS)
      concentrations, using a pure culture of Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus as
      inoculum. FW concentrations (in VS) above 2.9gL(-1) caused a lag phase of 5days
      on biohydrogen production. No lag phase was observed for GW concentrations up to 
      25.6gL(-1). In the co-fermentation experiments, the highest hydrogen yield
      (46+/-1Lkg(-1)) was achieved for GW:FW 90:10% (w/w). In the second stage, a
      biomethane yield of 682+/-14Lkg(-1) was obtained using the end-products of GW:FW 
      90:10% co-fermentation. The energy generation predictable from co-fermentation
      and AD of GW:FW 90:10% is 0.5MJkg(-1) and 24.4MJkg(-1), respectively, which
      represents an interesting alternative for valorisation of wastes produced locally
      in communities.

AB  - Thermophiles are promising options to use as electrocatalysts for
      bioelectrochemical applications including microbial electrolysis. They possess
      several interesting characteristics such as ability to catalyze a broad range of 
      substrates at better rates and over a broad range of operating conditions, and
      better electrocatalysis/electrogenic activity over mesophiles. However, a very
      limited number of investigations have been carried out to explore the microbial
      reactions/pathways and the molecular mechanisms that contribute to better
      electrocatalysis/electrolysis in thermophiles. Here, we review the electroactive 
      characteristics of thermophiles, their electron transfer mechanisms, and
      molecular insights behind the choice of thermophiles for
      bioelectrochemical/electrolytic processes.

AB  - Microalgae are considered as promising cell factories for the production of
      various types of biofuels, including bioethanol, biodiesel, and biohydrogen by
      using carbon dioxide and sunlight. In spite of unique advantages of these
      microorganisms, the commercialization of microalgal biofuels has been hindered by
      poor economic features. Metabolic engineering is among the most promising
      strategies put forth to overcome this challenge. In this chapter, metabolic
      pathways involved in lipid and hydrogen production by microalgae are reviewed and
      discussed. Moreover, metabolic and genetic engineering approaches investigated
      for improving the rate of lipid (as a feedstock for biodiesel production) and
      biohydrogen synthesis are presented. Finally, genetic engineering tools and
      approaches employed for engineering microalgal metabolic pathways are elaborated.
      A thorough step-by-step protocol for reconstructing the metabolic pathway of
      various microorganisms including microalgae is also presented.

AB  - This research work has succeeded in recovering energy from glucose by generating 
      H2 with the aid of a Clostridium beijerinckii strain and obtaining electrical
      energy from compounds present in the H2 fermentation effluent in a microbial fuel
      cell (MFC) seeded with native port drainage sediment. In the fermentation step,
      49.5% of the initial glucose concentration (56mmol/L) was used to produce
      104mmol/L H2; 5, 33, 3, and 1mmol/L acetate, butyrate, lactate, and ethanol also 
      emerged, respectively. MFC tests by feeding the anodic compartment with acetate, 
      butyrate, lactate (individually or as a mixture), or the H2 fermentation effluent
      provided power density values ranging between 0.6 and 1.2W/m(2). Acetate
      furnished the highest power density with a nanowire-rich biofilm despite the
      lowest anode bacterial concentration (10(12) 16S gene copies/g of sediment).
      Non-conventional exoelectrogenic microbial communities were observed in the
      acetate-fed MFC; e.g., Pseudomonadaceae (Pseudomonas) and Clostridia
      (Acidaminobacter, Fusibacter).

AB  - Factorial fermentation experiments on food waste (FW) inoculated with activated
      sludge (AS) were conducted to investigate the effects of pH and the
      inoculum-to-substrate ratio (ISR [g VSAS/g TOCFW]) on biohydrogen production. The
      two parameters affected the H2 yield, the fermentation rate and the biochemical
      pathways. The minimum and maximum yields were 41L H2/kg TOCFW (pH=7.5, ISR=1.74) 
      and 156-160L H2/kg TOCFW (pH=5.5, ISR=0.58 and 1.74). The range of carbohydrates 
      conversion into H2 was 0.37-1.45mol H2/mol hexose, corresponding to 9.4-36.2% of 
      the theoretical threshold. A second-order predictive model for H2 production
      identified an optimum region at low pHs and high ISRs, with a theoretical maximum
      of 168 L H2/kg TOCFW at pH=5.5 and ISR=1.74. The Spearman's correlation method
      revealed several relationships between the variables, suggesting the potentially 
      governing metabolic pathways, which turned out to involve both hydrogenogenic
      pathways and competing reactions.

AB  - To achieve the co-production of H2 and CH4, co-digestion of food waste (FW) and
      paper waste (PW) was performed on the recirculated two-phase anaerobic digestion 
      (R-TPAD). The PW content in the feedstock increased from 0% to 20%, 40% and 50%
      (in total solids) with FW as the rest. The results showed that bioH2 and bioCH4
      were simultaneously and stably produced in the long-term operation. With the
      increasing PW content, the removal efficiency of volatile solids decreased
      slightly from 84.9% to 78.4%; the bioH2 yields increased from 50 to 79
      NL-H2/kg-VSfed while the bioCH4 yields decreased from 426 to 329 NL-CH4/kg-VSfed.
      With the fixed amount of FW, adding PW could significantly increase the total
      bioenergy yields. The relative abundance showed that the key H2-producing
      bacteria, Caproiciproducens and Thermoanaerobacterium, increased after PW
      addition. The microbial distribution suggests that the H2-producers were
      recirculated to the first stage after proliferating in the second stage.

AB  - The aim of this work was to compare the biohydrogen production potential of
      undetoxified and detoxified acid hydrolysates from A. tequilana bagasse.
      Detoxification was carried out with activated carbon at different concentrations 
      and pH values. Results indicated that pH was not a significant variable, while
      the lowest evaluated concentration of activated carbon (1% p/v) significantly
      promoted the highest removal of acetic acid (89%) with minimal losses of
      fermentable sugars. Regarding dark fermentation experiments, central composite
      designs were used to optimize COD and pH variables for both substrates,
      undetoxified and detoxified hydrolysates (activated carbon 1% p/v and pH 0.6). At
      optimal conditions, the detoxified hydrolysate produced 33% more biohydrogen than
      the undetoxified one. Hydrogen molar yields were 1.71 and 1.23mol H2/molsugar,
      respectively. This improvement was correlated to changes in metabolic byproducts,
      since the detoxified hydrolysate produced only acetic and butyric acids, while
      lactic acid was detected in the undetoxified hydrolysate.

AB  - Microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) for hydrogen production exhibit great
      advantages over many other biohydrogen production techniques in terms of
      versatility of substrate and hydrogen yield. However, hydrogen and acetate
      scavenging by methanogens puts forward a great challenge to the application of
      single chamber MECs when using mixed culture. In this study, we investigated the 
      feasibility of using acetylene, a low-cost fuel and chemical building block, to
      selectively inhibit methanogenesis in single chamber MECs. Results demonstrate
      that the periodical injection of low concentration acetylene (1% and 5%) can
      successfully inhibit methanogenesis in MECs using both acetate and glucose as
      substrates. Current generation by exoelectrogens and the syntrophy between
      fermentative bacteria and exoelectrogens, however, were not negatively affected. 
      Compared with the classic methanogen inhibitor, 2-Bromoethanesulfonate (BES), the
      low concentration acetylene demonstrates superior effectiveness in MECs. These
      results demonstrate the great potential of using acetylene as a cost-effective
      inhibitor against methanogenesis in MECs.

      Concentrations of Salt (Na(+)) and Nitrogen.
PG  - 283-291

AB  - Fermentation of food waste in the presence of different concentrations of salt
      (Na(+)) and ammonia was conducted to investigate the interrelation of Na(+) and
      ammonia content in biohydrogen production. Analysis of the experimental results
      showed that peak hydrogen production differed according to the ammonia and Na(+) 
      concentration. The peak hydrogen production levels achieved were (97.60, 91.94,
      and 49.31) ml/g COD at (291.41, 768.75, and 1,037.89) mg-N/L of ammonia and (600,
      1,000, and 4,000) mg-Na(+)/L of salt concentration, respectively. At peak
      hydrogen production, the ammonia concentration increased along with increasing
      salt concentration in the medium. This means that for peak hydrogen production,
      the C/N ratio decreased with increasing salt content in the medium. The
      butyrate/acetate (B/A) ratio was higher in proportion to the bio-hydrogen
      production (r-square: 0.71, p-value: 0.0006). Different concentrations of Na(+)
      and ammonia in the medium also produced diverse microbial communities. Klebsiella
      sp., Enterobacter sp., and Clostridium sp. were predominant with high
      bio-hydrogen production, while Lactococcus sp. was found with low bio-hydrogen
      production.

TI  - Comparative genomic analysis of Parageobacillus thermoglucosidasius strains with 
      distinct hydrogenogenic capacities.
PG  - 880
LID - 10.1186/s12864-018-5302-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The facultatively anaerobic thermophile Parageobacillus
      thermoglucosidasius produces hydrogen gas (H2) by coupling CO oxidation to proton
      reduction in the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction via a carbon monoxide
      dehydrogenase-hydrogenase enzyme complex. Although little is known about the
      hydrogenogenic capacities of different strains of this species, these organisms
      offer a potentially viable process for the synthesis of this alternative energy
      source. RESULTS: The WGS-catalyzed H2 production capacities of four distinct P.
      thermoglucosidasius strains were determined by cultivation and gas analysis.
      Three strains (DSM 2542(T), DSM 2543 and DSM 6285) were hydrogenogenic, while the
      fourth strain (DSM 21625) was not. Furthermore, in one strain (DSM 6285) H2
      production commenced earlier in the cultivation than the other hydrogenogenic
      strains. Comparative genomic analysis of the four strains identified extensive
      differences in the protein complement encoded on the genomes, some of which are
      postulated to contribute to the different hydrogenogenic capacities of the
      strains. Furthermore, polymorphisms and deletions in the CODH-NiFe hydrogenase
      loci may also contribute towards this variable phenotype. CONCLUSIONS:
      Disparities in the hydrogenogenic capacities of different P. thermoglucosidasius 
      strains were identified, which may be correlated to variability in their global
      proteomes and genetic differences in their CODH-NiFe hydrogenase loci. The data
      from this study may contribute towards an improved understanding of WGS-catalysed
      hydrogenogenesis by P. thermoglucosidasius.

TI  - Towards Biohydrogen Separation Using Poly(Ionic Liquid)/Ionic Liquid Composite
      Membranes.
LID - E124 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/membranes8040124 [doi]
AB  - Considering the high potential of hydrogen (H(2)) as a clean energy carrier, the 
      implementation of high performance and cost-effective biohydrogen (bioH(2))
      purification techniques is of vital importance, particularly in fuel cell
      applications. As membrane technology is a potentially energy-saving solution to
      obtain high-quality biohydrogen, the most promising poly(ionic liquid)
      (PIL)(-)ionic liquid (IL) composite membranes that had previously been studied by
      our group for CO(2)/N(2) separation, containing pyrrolidinium-based PILs with
      fluorinated or cyano-functionalized anions, were chosen as the starting point to 
      explore the potential of PIL(-)IL membranes for CO(2)/H(2) separation. The CO(2) 
      and H(2) permeation properties at the typical conditions of biohydrogen
      production (T = 308 K and 100 kPa of feed pressure) were measured and discussed. 
      PIL(-)IL composites prepared with the [C(CN)(3)](-) anion showed higher
      CO(2)/H(2) selectivity than those containing the [NTf(2)](-) anion. All the
      membranes revealed CO(2)/H(2) separation performances above the upper bound for
      this specific separation, highlighting the composite incorporating 60 wt% of
      [C(2)mim][C(CN)(3)] IL.

AB  - Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) are a group of diverse anaerobic microorganisms
      omnipresent in natural habitats and engineered environments that use sulfur
      compounds as the electron acceptor for energy metabolism. Dissimilatory sulfate
      reduction (DSR)-based techniques mediated by SRB have been utilized in many
      sulfate-containing wastewater treatment systems worldwide, particularly for acid 
      mine drainage, groundwater, sewage and industrial wastewater remediation.
      However, DSR processes are often operated suboptimally and disturbances are
      common in practical application. To improve the efficiency and robustness of
      SRB-based processes, it is necessary to study SRB metabolism and operational
      conditions. In this review, the mechanisms of DSR processes are reviewed and
      discussed focusing on intracellular and extracellular electron transfer with
      different electron donors (hydrogen, organics, methane and electrodes). Based on 
      the understanding of the metabolism of SRB, responses of SRB to environmental
      stress (pH-, temperature-, and salinity-related stress) are summarized at the
      species and community levels. Application in these stressed conditions is
      discussed and future research is proposed. The feasibility of recovering energy
      and resources such as biohydrogen, hydrocarbons, polyhydroxyalkanoates, magnetite
      and metal sulfides through the use of SRB were investigated but some
      long-standing questions remain unanswered. Linking the existing scientific
      understanding and observations to practical application is the challenge as
      always for promotion of SRB-based techniques.

AB  - In this study, a lactate-type fermentation entailing the consumption of lactate
      and acetate (lactate-acetate pathway) is proposed to deal with lactic acid
      bacteria (LAB) inhibition during the production of biohydrogen (bioH2) from
      tequila vinasse. The effects of total solids content, substrate concentration,
      nutrient formulation and inoculum addition on bioH2 production performance were
      investigated. Batch experiments were performed in a 3-L completely mixed reactor 
      at 35 degrees C and pH 6.5-5.8. The lactate-acetate pathway mediated consistent
      bioH2 production which was influenced by inoculum addition followed by substrate 
      concentration, nutrient formulation and solids content. Maximum bioH2 production 
      rate (225NmL/L-h) and yield (124NmL/g VSadded) were achieved by removing
      suspended solids and enhancing nutrient content, respectively. Illumina
      sequencing-based analysis revealed a dominance of Clostridium in the inoculum,
      which together with LAB and acetic acid bacteria shaped a keystone cluster for
      avoiding LAB inhibition while ensuring consistent bioH2 production performance.

AB  - This study focused on the effect of feed glucose and acetic acid on biohydrogen
      production by Thermotoga neapolitana under continuous-flow conditions. Increasing
      the feed glucose concentration from 11.1 to 41.6mM decreased the hydrogen yield
      from 3.6 (+/-0.1) to 1.4 (+/-0.1)molH2/mol glucose. The hydrogen production rate 
      concomitantly increased until 27.8mM of feed glucose but remained unaffected when
      feed glucose was further raised to 41.6mM. Increasing the acetic acid
      concentration from 0 to 240mM hampered dark fermentation in batch bioassays,
      diminishing the cumulative hydrogen production by 45% and the hydrogen production
      rate by 57%, but induced no negative effect during continuous operation. Indeed, 
      throughout the continuous flow operation the process performance improved
      considerably, as indicated by the 47% increase of hydrogen yield up to 3.1
      (+/-0.1)molH2/mol glucose on day 110 at 27.8mM feed glucose.

LID - 10.21307/pjm-2018-033 [doi]
AB  - Lower temperature biohydrogen production has always been attractive, due to the
      lower energy requirements. However, the slow metabolic rate of psychrotolerant
      biohydrogen-producing bacteria is a common problem that affects their biohydrogen
      yield. This study reports on the improved substrate synthesis and biohydrogen
      productivity by the psychrotolerant Klebsiella sp. strain ABZ11, isolated from
      Antarctic seawater sample. The isolate was screened for biohydrogen production at
      30 degrees C, under facultative anaerobic condition. The isolate is able to
      ferment glucose, fructose and sucrose with biohydrogen production rate and yield 
      of 0.8 mol/l/h and 3.8 mol/g, respectively at 10 g/l glucose concentration. It
      also showed 74% carbohydrate uptake and 95% oxygen uptake ability, and a wide
      growth temperature range with optimum at 37 degrees C. Klebsiella sp. ABZ11 has a
      short biohydrogen production lag phase, fast substrate uptake and is able to
      tolerate the presence of oxygen in the culture medium. Thus, the isolate has a
      potential to be used for lower temperature biohydrogen production process.

AB  - This study investigated the interrelations between hydrogen synthesis and
      Photosystem I electron transport rate in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The
      fluorescence of both photosystems (PS I and PS II) was monitored using a Dual
      Pulse Amplitude Modulated (PAM) Fluorometer. Hydrogen synthesis was induced by
      eliminating sulphur from the growth media (TAP-S). Multiple physiological
      parameters [rETR, Y (I), Y (II), NPQ, alpha, Fv/Fm and YI:YII] were recorded
      using the Dual PAM and correlated to hydrogen produced. There was a 66% increase 
      in Photosystem I rETRmax during hydrogen production. A significant direct
      correlation existed between PS 1 rETRmax and hydrogen evolution values over the
      ten-day period (r=0.895, p<0.01) indicating that PS I can be considered as a
      driver of H2 production. Significant correlations between rETRmax of PS I and H2 
      evolution suggest a novel physiological indicator to monitor H2 production during
      the three critical phases identified in this study.

PG  - 176
LID - 10.1007/s11274-018-2558-9 [doi]
AB  - Hydrogen is a promising energy source that is believed to replace the
      conventional energy sources e.g. fossil fuels over years. Hydrogen production
      methods can be divided into conventional production methods which depend mainly
      on fossil fuels and alternative production methods including electrolysis of
      water, biophotolysis and fermentation hydrogen production from organic waste
      materials. Compared to the conventional methods, the alternative hydrogen
      production methods are less energy intensive and negative-value substrates i.e.
      waste materials can be used to produce hydrogen. Among the alternative methods,
      fermentation process including dark and photo-fermentation has gained more
      attention because these processes are simple, waste materials can be utilized,
      and high hydrogen yields can be achieved. The fermentation process is affected by
      several parameters such as type of inoculum, pH, temperature, substrate type and 
      concentration, hydraulic retention time, etc. In order to achieve optimum
      hydrogen yields and maximum substrate degradation, the operating conditions of
      the fermentation process must be optimized. In this review, two routes for
      biohydrogen production as dark and photo-fermentation are discussed.
      Dark/photo-fermentation technology is a new approach that can be used to increase
      the hydrogen yield and improve the energy recovery from organic wastes.

TI  - Pretreatment of Lignocellulosic Materials as Substrates for Fermentation
      Processes.
LID - E2937 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules23112937 [doi]
AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass is an abundant and renewable resource that potentially
      contains large amounts of energy. It is an interesting alternative for fossil
      fuels, allowing the production of biofuels and other organic compounds. In this
      paper, a review devoted to the processing of lignocellulosic materials as
      substrates for fermentation processes is presented. The review focuses on
      physical, chemical, physicochemical, enzymatic, and microbiologic methods of
      biomass pretreatment. In addition to the evaluation of the mentioned methods, the
      aim of the paper is to understand the possibilities of the biomass pretreatment
      and their influence on the efficiency of biofuels and organic compounds
      production. The effects of different pretreatment methods on the lignocellulosic 
      biomass structure are described along with a discussion of the benefits and
      drawbacks of each method, including the potential generation of inhibitory
      compounds for enzymatic hydrolysis, the effect on cellulose digestibility, the
      generation of compounds that are toxic for the environment, and energy and
      economic demand. The results of the investigations imply that only the stepwise
      pretreatment procedure may ensure effective fermentation of the lignocellulosic
      biomass. Pretreatment step is still a challenge for obtaining cost-effective and 
      competitive technology for large-scale conversion of lignocellulosic biomass into
      fermentable sugars with low inhibitory concentration.

TI  - Introduction of Glyoxylate Bypass Increases Hydrogen Gas Yield from Acetate and
      l-Glutamate in Rhodobacter sphaeroides.
LID - e01873-18 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/AEM.01873-18 [doi]
AB  - Rhodobacter sphaeroides produces hydrogen gas (H2) from organic compounds via
      nitrogenase under anaerobic-light conditions in the presence of poor nitrogen
      sources, such as l-glutamate. R. sphaeroides utilizes the ethylmalonyl-coenzyme A
      (EMC) pathway for acetate assimilation, but its H2 yield from acetate in the
      presence of l-glutamate has been reported to be low. In this study, the deletion 
      of ccr encoding crotonyl-coenzyme A (crotonyl-CoA) carboxylase/reductase, a key
      enzyme for the EMC pathway in R. sphaeroides, revealed that the EMC pathway is
      essential for H2 production from acetate and l-glutamate but not for growth and
      acetate consumption in the presence of l-glutamate. We introduced a plasmid
      expressing aceBA from Rhodobacter capsulatus encoding two key enzymes for the
      glyoxylate bypass into R. sphaeroides, which resulted in a 64% increase in H2
      production. However, compared with the wild-type strain expressing heterologous
      aceBA genes, the strain with aceBA introduced in the genetic background of an EMC
      pathway-disrupted mutant showed a lower H2 yield. These results indicate that a
      combination of the endogenous EMC pathway and a heterologously expressed
      glyoxylate bypass is beneficial for H2 production. In addition, introduction of
      the glyoxylate bypass into a polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) biosynthesis-disrupted
      mutant resulted in a delay in growth along with H2 production, although its H2
      yield was comparable to that of the wild-type strain expressing heterologous
      aceBA genes. These results suggest that PHB production is important for fitness
      to the culture during H2 production from acetate and l-glutamate when both
      acetate-assimilating pathways are present.IMPORTANCE As an alternative to fossil 
      fuel, H2 is a promising renewable energy source. Although photofermentative H2
      production from acetate is key to developing an efficient process of biohydrogen 
      production from biomass-derived sugars, H2 yields from acetate and l-glutamate by
      R. sphaeroides have been reported to be low. In this study, we observed that in
      addition to the endogenous EMC pathway, heterologous expression of the glyoxylate
      bypass in R. sphaeroides markedly increased H2 yields from acetate and
      l-glutamate. Therefore, this study provides a novel strategy for improving H2
      yields from acetate in the presence of l-glutamate and contributes to a clear
      understanding of acetate metabolism in R. sphaeroides during photofermentative H2
      production.

TI  - Intermediate-temperature electrolysis of energy grass Miscanthus sinensis for
      sustainable hydrogen production.
PG  - 16186
LID - 10.1038/s41598-018-34544-y [doi]
AB  - Biohydrogen produced from the electrolysis of biomass is promising because the
      onset voltages are less than 1.0 V and comparable to those of water and
      alcohol-water electrolysis. The present study focuses on Miscanthus sinensis as a
      model grass because of its abundance and ease of cultivation in Japan. The
      electrochemical performance and hydrogen formation properties of electrolysis
      cells using grass as a biohydrogen source were evaluated at intermediate
      temperature to achieve electrolysis. The components, such as holocellulose,
      cellulose, lignin, and extractives, were separated from Miscanthus sinensis to
      understand the reactions of Miscanthus sinensis in the electrolysis cell. The
      relatively high resistivity and low current-voltage performance of an
      electrolysis cell using lignin were responsible for degradation of the
      electrolysis properties compared to those with pure cellulose or holocellulose as
      biohydrogen resources. Biohydrogen was formed according to Faraday's law and
      evolved continuously at 0.1 A cm(-2) for 3,000 seconds.

TI  - Effect of pH and temperature on microbial community structure and carboxylic acid
      yield during the acidogenic digestion of duckweed.
PG  - 275
LID - 10.1186/s13068-018-1278-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Duckweeds (Lemnaceae) are efficient aquatic plants for wastewater
      treatment due to their high nutrient-uptake capabilities and resilience to severe
      environmental conditions. Combined with their rapid growth rates, high starch,
      and low lignin contents, duckweeds have also gained popularity as a biofuel
      feedstock for thermochemical conversion and alcohol fermentation. However,
      studies on the acidogenic anaerobic digestion of duckweed into carboxylic acids, 
      another group of chemicals which are precursors of higher-value chemicals and
      biofuels, are lacking. In this study, a series of laboratory batch experiments
      were performed to determine the favorable operating conditions (i.e., temperature
      and pH) to maximize carboxylic acid production from wastewater-derived duckweed
      during acidogenic digestion. Batch reactors with 25 g/l solid loading were
      operated anaerobically for 21 days under mesophilic (35 degrees C) or
      thermophilic (55 degrees C) conditions at an acidic (5.3) or basic (9.2) pH. At
      the conclusion of the experiment, the dominant microbial communities under
      various operating conditions were assessed using high-throughput sequencing.
      RESULTS: The highest duckweed-carboxylic acid conversion of 388 +/- 28 mg acetic 
      acid equivalent per gram volatile solids was observed under mesophilic and basic 
      conditions, with an average production rate of 0.59 g/l/day. This result is
      comparable to those reported for acidogenic digestion of other organics such as
      food waste. The superior performance observed under these conditions was
      attributed to both chemical treatment and microbial bioconversion. Hydrogen
      recovery was only observed under acidic thermophilic conditions, as 23.5 +/- 0.5 
      ml/g of duckweed volatile solids added. More than temperature, pH controlled the 
      overall structure of the microbial communities. For instance, differentially
      abundant enrichments of Veillonellaceae acidaminococcus were observed in acidic
      samples, whereas enrichments of Clostridiaceae alkaliphilus were found in the
      basic samples. Acidic mesophilic conditions were found to enrich acetoclastic
      methanogenic populations over processing times longer than 10 days. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Operating conditions have a significant effect on the yield and composition of
      the end products resulting from acidogenic digestion of duckweed.
      Wastewater-derived duckweed is a technically feasible alternative feedstock for
      the production of advanced biofuel precursors; however, techno-economic analysis 
      is needed to determine integrated full-scale system feasibility and economic
      viability.

AB  - A CO2-neutral energy production alternative compared to conventional fossil fuel 
      utilization is biohydrogen (H2) production. Three basic mechanisms for microbial 
      H2 production exist: photosynthetic H2 production, photo-fermentative H2
      production, and dark fermentative H2 production (DFHP). Despite surmounting
      reports in literature on the characterization and optimization of DFHP systems,
      H2 production has not yet reached an industrial scale. Here, DFHP characteristics
      of pure culture of microorganisms from more than one century were reviewed and
      analysed. Analysing pure culture DFHP has the advantage that the physiology and
      the biotechnological potential of a specific organism can be exploited with the
      aim to optimize and establish a straightforward H2 production bioprocess.
      Essential to this effort is the analysis of reported values across
      phylogenetically distinct groups of microorganisms. Therefore, an extensive
      review and subsequent in-depth meta-data analysis of DFHP from pure cultures was 
      performed with the goals of providing: a comprehensive overview to their
      physiology, reviewing closed batch, batch, and continuous culture DFHP from an
      energy production perspective, and to integrate physiology and biotechnology
      through comprehensive meta-data analyses, statistics, and modelling. We revealed 
      that a comparison of H2 productivity and H2 yield (Y(H2/S)) could unambiguously
      be performed on a carbon molar level. Clear dependencies between Y(H2/S) and the 
      metabolic pathways of specific phylogenetic DFHP groups were found. With respect 
      to specific H2 productivity and Y(H2/S) the superior phylogenetic group for DFHP 
      was Thermococcaceae. Moreover, a distinct correlation between high Y(H2/S) and
      high H2 productivity was identified. The best substrate for H2 production was
      found to be formate. Statistical analysis and modelling provided the input
      parameter sets that could be used to optimize of H2 production of Clostridiaceae 
      and Enterobacteriaceae. With respect to the overall goal to improve H2 production
      beyond reported values, we suggest to utilize Thermococcaceae, and to integrate
      these organisms into a H2 production set-up encompassing a cell retention system 
      that would allow the accumulation of a high biomass density. Then both, high H2
      production and Y(H2/S) might be achieved at the same time. Such an integrated
      system could finally render DFHP a biotechnologically useful process.

TI  - Pseudogene product YqiG is important for pflB expression and biohydrogen
      production in Escherichia coli BW25113.
PG  - 435

AB  - Pseudogenes in the Escherichia coli genome are assumed to be non-functional. In
      this study, Keio collection BW25113yqiG and YqiG-producing strain
      (BW25113/pCA24N-YqiG) were used to evaluate the importance of pseudogene yqiG in 
      hydrogen metabolism. Our results show pseudogene protein YqiG was identified as
      an essential protein in the production of biohydrogen from glucose. The mutant
      yqiG decreased biohydrogen production from 37 micromol mg(-1) protein to 6
      micromol mg(-1) protein compared to the wild-type strain, and glucose consumption
      was reduced by 80%. Through transcriptional analysis, we found that the yqiG
      mutation represses pflB transcription tenfold; pflB encodes pyruvate-formate
      lyase, one of the key enzymes in the anaerobic metabolism of E. coli. Moreover,
      production of YqiG stimulated glycolysis and increased biohydrogen productivity
      1.5-fold compared to that of the wild-type strain. Thus, YqiG is important for
      the central glycolysis reaction and is able to influence hydrogen metabolism
      activity in E. coli.

AB  - Theoretical hydrogen (H2) yield by dark fermentative route is 12 mol/mol of
      glucose. Biological H2 production yields of 3.8 mol/mol of glucose by microbes
      have been reported. Transient gene inactivation in combination with adaptive

TI  - Efforts toward optimization of aerobic biohydrogen reveal details of secondary
      regulation of biological nitrogen fixation by nitrogenous compounds in
      Azotobacter vinelandii.
PG  - 10315-10325
LID - 10.1007/s00253-018-9363-0 [doi]
AB  - Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) through the enzyme nitrogenase is performed by
      a unique class of organisms known as diazotrophs. One interesting facet of BNF is
      that it produces molecular hydrogen (H2) as a requisite by-product. In the
      absence of N2 substrate, or under conditions that limit access of N2 to the
      enzyme through modifications of amino acids near the active site, nitrogenase
      activity can be redirected toward a role as a dedicated hydrogenase. In
      free-living diazotrophs, nitrogenases are tightly regulated to minimize BNF to
      meet only the growth requirements of the cell, and are often accompanied by
      uptake hydrogenases that oxidize the H2 by-product to recover the electrons from 
      this product. The wild-type strain of Azotobacter vinelandii performs all of the 
      tasks described above to minimize losses of H2 while also growing as an obligate 
      aerobe. Individual alterations to A. vinelandii have been demonstrated that
      disrupt key aspects of the N2 reduction cycle, thereby diverting resources and
      energy toward the production of H2. In this work, we have combined three
      approaches to override the primary regulation of BNF and redirect metabolism to
      drive biological H2 production by nitrogenase in A. vinelandii. The resulting
      H2-producing strain was further utilized as a surrogate to study secondary,
      post-transcriptional regulation of BNF by several key nitrogen-containing
      metabolites. The improvement in yields of H2 that were achieved through various
      combinations of these three approaches was compared and is presented along with
      the insights into inhibition of BNF by several nitrogen compounds that are common
      in various waste streams. The findings indicate that both ammonium and nitrite
      hinder BNF through this secondary inhibition, but urea and nitrate do not. These 
      results provide essential details to inform future biosynthetic approaches to
      yield nitrogen products that do not inadvertently inhibit BNF.

AB  - Graphene oxide (GO) treated thermostable crude cellulase has been obtained via
      fungal co-cultivation of strain Cladosporium cladosporioides NS2 and Emericella
      variecolor NS3 using mix substrate of orange peel and rice straw under solid
      state fermentation (SSF). Enzyme activity of 60IU/gds FP, 300IU/gds EG and
      400IU/gds BGL are recorded in the presence of 1.0% GO in 96h. This crude enzyme
      showed 50 degrees C as optimum incubation temperature, thermally stable at 55
      degrees C for 600min and stability in the pH range 4.5-8.0. Further, 70.04g/L of 
      sugar hydrolyzate is obtained from enzymatic conversion of 3.0% alkali
      pre-treated baggase using GO treated crude cellulase. Finally, 2870ml/L
      cumulative biohydrogen production having bacterial biomass approximately 2.2g/L
      and the complimentary initial pH 7.0 is recorded from sugar hydrolyzate via dark 
      fermentation using co-culture of Clostridium pasteurianum (MTCC116) and a newly
      isolated Bacillus subtilis PF_1.

AB  - This review article focuses on an assessment of the innovative Gas Separation
      Membrane Bioreactor (GS-MBR), which is an emerging technology because of its
      potential for in-situ biohydrogen production and separation. The GS-MBR, as a
      special membrane bioreactor, enriches CO2 directly from the headspace of the
      anaerobic H2 fermentation process. CO2 can be fed as a substrate to auxiliary
      photo-bioreactors to grow microalgae as a promising raw material for
      biocatalyzed, dark fermentative H2-evolution. Overall, these features make the
      GS-MBR worthy of study. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the GS-MBR has not
      been studied in detail to date; hence, a comprehensive review of this topic will 
      be useful to the scientific community.

AB  - The objective of the study was to evaluate the potential application of defatted 
      algal biomass (DAB) residue as a resource for biobased product synthesis in the
      biorefinery framework. Acid-catalyzed pretreatment of DAB residue resulted in
      higher reducing sugars (RS) solubilization (0.26gRS/gDAB) than corresponding base
      method (0.19gRS/gDAB). Subsequently, resulting RS were acidogenically fermented
      for the production of Bio-H2 and short chain carboxylic acids (SCA)/volatile
      fatty acids (VFA) at varying redox conditions (pH: 6, 7 and 10). Biosystem with
      pH-6 resulted in higher SCA (0.54gSCA/gRS) and Bio-H2 production (0.83 l)
      followed by pH-10 (0.43gSCA/gRS, 0.71 l) and pH-7 (0.27gSCA/gRS, 0.48 l). Higher 
      SCA production in pH-6 system resulted in maximum acidification (23%). Algal
      biomass majorly derived from CO2 and its residues after lipids extraction
      accounted as major feedstock for acidogenic product synthesis. Evaluation of
      these studies using DAB residues offers sustainability to algal refineries on its
      entirety use.

AB  - Cashew apple bagasse (CAB) has been studied as feedstock for the biohydrogen
      production using Clostridium roseum and the dark fermentation process.
      Pretreatment with alkaline hydrogen peroxide (CAB-AHP) on raw material and the
      acid and enzymatic hydrolysis have been taken into account to evaluate the H2
      yields. Results show that the acid hydrolysate obtained from CAB produced higher 
      H2 molar yield (HMY) (15 mmolH2/Lhydrolysate) than the acid hydrolysate from
      CAB-AHP (4.99 mmolH2/Lhydrolysate), These HMY were noticeably higher than values 
      obtained from the enzymatic hydrolysate of CAB-AHP (1.05 mmolH2/Lhydrolysa) and
      the enzymatic hydrolysate of CAB (0.59 mmolH2/Lhydrolysa). The maximum
      biohydrogen productivity (12.57 mLH2/L.h) was achieved using the acid hydrolysate
      from CAB, with a H2 content of about 72% vol, that could be satisfactory in view 
      of an energetic applications of the biogas. Results suggest that CAB could be
      considered for the hydrogen production process, providing an appropriate
      destination for this lignocellulosic biomass, and consequently, reducing the
      environmental impact it can exert.

AB  - Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are the only polyesters that are completely
      synthesized biologically and possess features equivalent to petroleum-based
      plastics besides being biodegradable. PHA based materials may certainly prove
      helpful in addressing the concerns caused due to the indiscriminate use of
      synthetic plastics. However, the cost of producing these polymers on a large
      scale is still uneconomical. Various approaches have been developed to tackle
      this issue through usage of agro-industrial wastes, co-production of high market 
      value products, polymer extraction using green solvents, etc. The advent of
      recombineering and CRISPR technologies has broadened the scope of constructing a 
      microbe capable of synthesizing multiple products with economic feasibility.
      Quite a few high-market value chemicals are possible to synthesize along with the
      favorable accumulation of PHA. The present article attempts to review all PHA
      polymer co-production processes with other chemicals reported till date and
      discusses the opportunities for their large-scale operation in future.

      thermostable biocatalyst.
PG  - 237

AB  - BACKGROUND: Replacing fossil fuels as energy carrier requires alternatives that
      combine sustainable production, high volumetric energy density, easy and fast
      refueling for mobile applications, and preferably low risk of hazard. Molecular
      hydrogen (H2) has been considered as promising alternative; however, practical
      application is struggling because of the low volumetric energy density and the
      explosion hazard when stored in large amounts. One way to overcome these
      limitations is the transient conversion of H2 into other chemicals with increased
      volumetric energy density and lower risk hazard, for example so-called liquid
      organic hydrogen carriers such as formic acid/formate that is obtained by
      hydrogenation of CO2. Many homogenous and heterogenous chemical catalysts have
      been described in the past years, however, often requiring high pressures and
      temperatures. Recently, the first biocatalyst for this reaction has been
      described opening the route to a biotechnological alternative for this
      conversion. RESULTS: The hydrogen-dependent CO2 reductase (HDCR) is a highly
      active biocatalyst for storing H2 in the form of formic acid/formate by
      reversibly catalyzing the hydrogenation of CO2. We report the identification,
      isolation, and characterization of the first thermostable HDCR operating at
      temperatures up to 70 degrees C. The enzyme was isolated from the thermophilic
      acetogenic bacterium Thermoanaerobacter kivui and displays exceptionally high
      activities in both reaction directions, substantially exceeding known chemical
      catalysts. CO2 hydrogenation is catalyzed at mild conditions with a turnover
      frequency of 9,556,000 h(-1) (specific activity of 900 micromol formate min(-1)
      mg(-1)) and the reverse reaction, H2 + CO2 release from formate, is catalyzed
      with a turnover frequency of 9,892,000 h(-1) (930 micromol H2 min(-1) mg(-1)).
      The HDCR of T. kivui consists of a [FeFe] hydrogenase subunit putatively coupled 
      to a tungsten-dependent CO2 reductase/formate dehydrogenase subunit by an array
      of iron-sulfur clusters. CONCLUSIONS: The discovery of the first thermostable
      HDCR provides a promising biological alternative for a chemically challenging
      reaction and might serve as model for the better understanding of catalysts able 
      to efficiently reduce CO2. The catalytic activity for reversible CO2
      hydrogenation of this enzyme is the highest activity known for bio- and chemical 
      catalysts and requiring only ambient temperatures and pressures. The
      thermostability provides more flexibility regarding the process parameters for a 
      biotechnological application.

AB  - Biohydrogen as one of the most appealing energy vector for the future represents 
      attractive avenue in alternative energy research. Recently, variety of
      biohydrogen production pathways has been suggested to improve the key features of
      the process. Nevertheless, researches are still needed to overcome remaining
      barriers to practical applications such as low yields and production rates.
      Considering practicality aspects, this review emphasized on anaerobic membrane
      bioreactors (AnMBRs) for biological hydrogen production. Recent advances and
      emerging issues associated with biohydrogen generation in AnMBR technology are
      critically discussed. Several techniques are highlighted that are aimed at
      overcoming these barriers. Moreover, environmental and economical potentials
      along with future research perspectives are addressed to drive biohydrogen
      technology towards practicality and economical-feasibility.

AB  - Simultaneous sludge fermentation and nitrite removal is an effective approach to 
      enhance nutrient removal from low carbon-wastewater. It was found in this work
      that the presence of nitrite largely promoted hydrogen production from acidic
      fermentation of waste activated sludge (WAS). The results showed that with an
      increase of nitrite from 0 to 250mg/L, the maximal hydrogen yield increased from 
      8.5 to 15.0mL/g VSS at pH 5.5 fermentation and 8.1-13.0mL/g VSS at pH 6
      fermentation. However, the maximal hydrogen yield from WAS fermentation at pH 8
      remained almost constant (2.9-3.7mL/g VSS) when nitrite was in the range of
      0-250mg/L. Further analyses revealed that free nitrous acid (FNA) rather than
      nitrite was the major contributor to the promotion of hydrogen yield. The
      mechanism investigations showed that FNA not only accelerated the disruption of
      sludge cells but also promoted the biodegradability of organics released, thereby
      provided more biodegradable substrates for subsequent hydrogen production.
      Although FNA inhibited activities of all microbes involved in the anaerobic
      fermentation, its inhibitions to hydrogen consumers were much severer than those 
      to hydrolytic microorganisms and hydrogen producers. Further investigations with 
      microbial community showed that FNA increased the abundances of hydrogen
      producers (e.g., Citrobacter sp.) and denitrifiers (e.g., Dechloromonas sp.), but
      reduced the abundances of hydrogen consumers (e.g., Clostridium_aceticum). This
      work demonstrated for the first time that FNA in WAS fermentation systems
      enhanced hydrogen production. The findings obtained expand the application field 
      of FNA and may provide supports for sustainable operation of wastewater treatment
      plants.

AB  - Suitable pretreatment can effectively enhance the fermentative hydrogen
      production from algae biomass. In this study, combined microwave-acid
      pretreatment was applied to disintegrate the biomass of macroalgae L. japonica,
      and dark fermentation in batch mode was conducted for hydrogen production. The
      results showed that combining microwave pretreatment at 140 degrees C and 2450MHz
      with 1% H2SO4 for 15min could effectively disrupt macroalgal cells and release
      the organic matters, and soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) concentration
      increased by 1.92-fold and achieved 5.12g/L. During the fermentation process,
      both polysaccharides and proteins were consumed. Hydrogen production process was 
      dominated by acetate-type fermentation, and the dominance of genus Clostridium
      contributed to more efficient hydrogen production. After the pretreatment,
      hydrogen yield increased from 15mL/g TSadded to 28mL/g TSadded, and energy
      conversion efficiency increased from 9.5% to 23.8%. Combined microwave-acid
      pretreatment is potential in enhancing hydrogen production from the biomass of L.
      japonica.

TI  - Bio-Based Compounds from Grape Seeds: A Biorefinery Approach.
LID - E1888 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules23081888 [doi]
AB  - Food and agricultural waste represents a growing problem with negative effects on
      the economy, environment, and human health. Winemaking produces byproducts with
      high added value, which can be used for new productions in several application
      fields. From the perspective of biorefinery and circular economy, grape seeds
      could be exploited by extracting bioactive compounds with high added value before
      using biomass for energy purposes. The markets concerned are, in addition to the 
      food, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals sectors, which use bioactive compounds, the 
      sector of biopolymeric materials and of energy for the production of biohydrogen 
      and biomethane. Generally, bioactive components should be investigated through an
      integrated and multidisciplinary study approach based on emerging analytical
      techniques; in this context, attention is addressed towards green and sustainable
      procedures; an update of extraction techniques, innovative technologies, and
      chemometrics are described. Nowadays, processes so far tested on a pilot scale
      for grape waste are developed to enhance the extraction yields. Here, a picture
      of the Italian experience applied to the byproducts of the wine industry is
      given.

AB  - In this study, a specific fraction of food waste, i.e. depackaging waste, was
      studied as substrate for hydrogen production by dark fermentation. During storage
      and transport of this liquid mixture, inhibitory compounds like acids or alcohol 
      might be produced by endogenous flora. A factorial fractional design based on the
      composition of the substrate was used to determine the best condition to convert 
      this substrate into hydrogen. First results indicated that the consortium used
      might convert high quantity of lactate into hydrogen. A batch culture confirmed
      that lactate was used as the main carbon source and a global yield of
      0.4molH2.mollactate(-1) was obtained. This study demonstrated the ability of the 
      consortium tested to convert different carbon sources (carbohydrates or lactate) 
      with good efficiency. These data represented an important parameter in the
      prospect of using an industrial substrate whose composition is liable to vary
      according to the conditions of storage and transport.

AB  - A pretreatment process using alkali/urea solution at low temperature was proposed
      for enhanced cellulosic biohydrogen production. Different alkaline solutions with
      both presence and absence of urea were studied. It can be found NaOH/Urea
      pretreatment exhibited excellent pretreatment performance at temperature from -8 
      degrees C to -20 degrees C. Microscopic structure observation combined FTIR
      analysis further demonstrated that NaOH/Urea pretreatment at low temperature
      could effectively disrupt the structure of rice straw and made more cellulose and
      hemicellulose available. The pretreated materials were then subjected for
      biohydrogen production by Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum M18. The
      maximum hydrogen production and energy conversion efficiency of 22.08mmol/L and
      9.76% were obtained from NaOH/Urea pretreated rice straw at low temperature. The 
      results were 161.92% and 56.91% higher than the counterpart without pretreatment,
      respectively. This study provides a new direction to pretreat lignocellulose
      efficiently for enhanced biohydrogen production at cold climate region.

TI  - CO-dependent hydrogen production by the facultative anaerobe Parageobacillus
      thermoglucosidasius.
PG  - 108
LID - 10.1186/s12934-018-0954-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The overreliance on dwindling fossil fuel reserves and the negative
      climatic effects of using such fuels are driving the development of new clean
      energy sources. One such alternative source is hydrogen (H2), which can be
      generated from renewable sources. Parageobacillus thermoglucosidasius is a
      facultative anaerobic thermophilic bacterium which is frequently isolated from
      high temperature environments including hot springs and compost. RESULTS:
      Comparative genomics performed in the present study showed that P.
      thermoglucosidasius encodes two evolutionary distinct H2-uptake
      [Ni-Fe]-hydrogenases and one H2-evolving hydrogenases. In addition, genes
      encoding an anaerobic CO dehydrogenase (CODH) are co-localized with genes
      encoding a putative H2-evolving hydrogenase. The co-localized of CODH and uptake 
      hydrogenase form an enzyme complex that might potentially be involved in
      catalyzing the water-gas shift reaction (CO + H2O --> CO2 + H2) in P.
      thermoglucosidasius. Cultivation of P. thermoglucosidasius DSM 2542(T) with an
      initial gas atmosphere of 50% CO and 50% air showed it to be capable of growth at
      elevated CO concentrations (50%). Furthermore, GC analyses showed that it was
      capable of producing hydrogen at an equimolar conversion with a final yield of
      1.08 H2/CO. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the potential of the facultative
      anaerobic P. thermoglucosidasius DSM 2542(T) for developing new strategies for
      the biohydrogen production.

AB  - This paper investigated the improving mechanisms and microbial community dynamics
      of using zero-valent iron nanoparticles (Fe(0) NPs) in hydrogen fermentation of
      grass. Results showed that Fe(0) NPs supplement improved microbial activity and
      changed dominant microbial communities from Enterobacter sp. to Clostridium sp., 
      which induced a more efficient metabolic pathway towards higher hydrogen
      production. Meanwhile, it is also proposed that Fe(0) NPs could accelerate
      electron transfer between ferredoxin and hydrogenase, and promote the activity of
      key enzymes by the released Fe(2+). The maximal hydrogen yield and hydrogen
      production rate were 64.7mL/g-dry grass and 12.1mL/h, respectively at Fe(0) NPs
      dosage of 400mg/L, which were 73.1% and 128.3% higher compared with the control
      group. Fe(0) NPs also shorten the lag time and facilitated the hydrolysis and
      utilization of grass. This study demonstrated that Fe(0) NPs could effectively
      improve hydrogen production and accelerate the fermentation process of grass.

AB  - The aim of the present work was to use a thermophilic consortium for H2
      production using lignocellulosic biomass in a single pot. The thermophilic
      consortium, growing at 60 degrees C utilized both glucose and xylose, making it
      an ideal source of microbes capable of utilizing and fermenting both hexose and
      pentose sugars. The optimization of pH, temperature, and substrate concentration 
      increased the H2 production from 1.07mmolH2/g of prairie cordgrass (PCG) to
      2.2mmolH2/g PCG by using the thermophilic consortium. A sequential cultivation of
      a thermostable lignocellulolytic enzyme producing strain Geobacillus sp. strain
      WSUCF1 (aerobic) with the thermophilic consortium (anaerobic) further increased
      H2 production with PCG 3-fold (3.74mmolH2/gPCG). A single pot sequential
      culturing of aerobic and anaerobic microbes can be sustainable and advantageous
      for industrial scale production of biofuels.

AB  - Biogenic nanoparticles are promising materials for their green synthesis method
      and good performance in stimulation on reduction of environmental contaminants.
      In this study, Pd(0) nanoparticles (bio-Pd) were generated by Klebsiella oxytoca 
      GS-4-08 in fermentative condition and in-situ improved the azo dye reduction. The
      bio-Pd was mainly located on cell membrane with a size range of 5-20nm by TEM and
      XRD data analyses. Anthraquinone-2-disulfonate (AQS) greatly increased the
      reduction rate of Pd(II) with a reduction efficiency as high as 96.54+/-0.23% in 
      24h. The quinone respiration theory, glucose metabolism and the biohydrogen
      pathway were used to explain the enhancement mechanism of the in-situ generated
      bio-Pd on azo dye reduction. These results indicate that the in-situ generated
      bio-Pd by K. oxytoca strain is efficient for azo dye reduction without complex
      preparation processes, which is of great significance for the removal and
      subsequent safe disposal of hazardous environmental compounds.

TI  - Biohydrogen Production as Clean Fuel from physically Pretreated Mixed Culture.
PG  - 80
LID - 10.4103/2277-9175.233030 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Due to depletion of fossil fuel reserves, global warming, and the
      need for energy efficiency, the new energy resource is required. For this
      purpose, hydrogen can be considered as clean and efficient energy carrier. In
      this study, biohydrogen production from physical pretreated mixed culture was
      investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, the optimal conditions for
      physical pretreatment of mixed culture were investigated for the enrichment of
      hydrogen-producing bacteria (HPB). Three individual pretreatment processes,
      including thermal, ultraviolet (UV) radiation, and ultrasonication (US) were
      conducted in batch tests. The batch tests were carried out via 500 mL glass
      flasks with working volume 400 mL. Glucose was used as sole substrate, and other 
      essential nutrient and trace elements were added. To agitation of substrate with 
      HPB inoculum, the magnet stirrer was used at 60 rpm. RESULTS: The results showed 
      the production of H2 gas could be increased by appropriate pretreatment methods
      including thermal pretreatment at 100 degrees C. At 100 degrees C as a
      pretreatment, the volume of H2 gas was 112.25 mL and followed by US (97.46 mL),
      UV (89.11 mL), 80 degrees C (72.72 mL), 90 degrees C (53.95 mL), and 70 degrees C
      (26.01 mL). In the pretreatment methods, the solution pH and effluent soluble
      chemical oxygen demand was 6.3-6.7 and 5100-8300 mg/L, respectively. CONCLUSIONS:
      The Gompertz model depicts that all R(2) values were more than 0.93, indicating
      that the fitted curves were best fitted with the experimental points.

TI  - Comparison of Acetate-butyrate and Acetate-ethanol Metabolic Pathway in
      Biohydrogen Production.
PG  - 101-107
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hydrogen gas is the cleanest energy carrier and could be produced by 
      biological process. Dark fermentation is one of the biohydrogen production
      methods that carried out just on organic wastes conversion. METHODS: In this
      study, the batch tests were conducted to compare the biohydrogen production and
      glucose fermentation via acetate-butyrate and acetate-ethanol metabolic pathway
      induced by NaOH and KOH (10 M) pretreatment. In batch test, the glucose
      concentration in the feed was varied from 3.75 to 15 g/L under mesophilic
      conditions (37 degrees C +/- 1 degrees C). In order to sludge pretreatment, NaOH 
      and KOH (as an alkaline agent) was used. RESULTS: Batch tests showed that maximum
      biohydrogen production under NaOH (2.7 +/- 0.5 L) and KOH (2.2 +/- 0.7 L)
      pretreatment was achieved at 15 g/L of influent glucose. In the batch test, with 
      increasing influent glucose concentration, the lower yields of hydrogen were
      observed. The biohydrogen reactions had good electron closure (5.2%-13.5%) for
      various glucose concentrations and pretreatments. For NaOH and KOH pretreatment, 
      the biohydrogen yield decreased from 2.49 to 1.63 and from 2.22 to 1.2 mol H2/mol
      glucose, respectively, when glucose concentration increased from 3.75 to 15 g/L. 
      CONCLUSIONS: By applying alkaline sludge pretreatment by NaOH and KOH, the
      glucose fermentation was followed with acetate-butyrate and acetate-ethanol
      metabolic pathway, respectively. The lower biohydrogen yields were observed under
      acetate-ethanol metabolic pathway and related to metabolically unfavorable for
      biohydrogen production.

AB  - Ruminating animals, especially cattle lack the carbohydrate active enzyme
      encoding genes which are required for the degradation of the glycosidic linkages 
      of plant cell wall carbohydrates (such as cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin and
      pectin). Thus, ruminating animals are completely dependent on the microorganisms 
      (anaerobic bacteria and fungi, methanogenic archaea and protozoa) residing in
      their rumen (hindgut). In this study, we have retrieved and analyzed the complete
      genome wide annotations of the Neocallimastigomycota division fungi such as
      Anaeromyces robustus, Neocallismatix californiae, Orpinomyces sp, Piromyces
      finnis, Piromyces sp E2. We have retrieved the InterPro, CAZy, KOG, KEGG, SM
      Clusters and MEROPS genome level data of these anaerobic fungi from JGI-MycoCosm 
      database. Results obtained in our study reveals that, the genomes of anaerobic
      fungi completely lack genes encoding for lignin degrading auxiliary activity
      enzymes. Contrastingly, these fungi outnumbered other fungi by having highest
      number of CAZyme encoding genes. The genes encoding for dockerins and
      carbohydrate binding modules exaggerated other CAZymes which are involved in the 
      structure and functioning of cellulosomes. Presence of cellulosomes and higher
      number of carbohydrate transport and metabolism genes also endorses the plant
      cell wall carbohydrate degrading abilities of these fungi. We also reported the
      tentative total cellulolytic, hemicellulolytic and pectinolytic abilities. And we
      have explicitly reported the genes, enzymes and the mechanisms involved in
      structure and functioning of the cellulosomes and hydrogenosomes. Our present
      work reveals the genomic machinery underlying the extrinsic plant cell wall
      degrading abilities of the anaerobic fungi. Results obtained in our study can be 
      significantly applied in improving the gut health of cattle and especially in the
      fields of biofuel, biorefining and bioremediation-based industries.

      with edible fungal pretreated rice straw.
PG  - 22924-22930
LID - 10.1039/c8ra03361g [doi]
AB  - An edible fungal pretreatment of rice straw was proposed for enhanced hydrogen
      production while reducing the chemical cost for traditional biological hydrogen
      production from lignocellulose. In this research, rice straw was pretreated by
      edible fungus Gymnopus contrarius J2 at room temperature under static conditions 
      for 15 d at first. The highest hydrogen yield of 5.71 mmol g(-1)-pretreated rice 
      straw was obtained, 74% higher than the counterpart without pretreatment.
      Chemical composition analysis demonstrated that lignin removal was up to 22.4%
      with a little cellulose and hemicellulose loss of 13.3% and 17.1%, respectively, 
      which is in favor of hydrogen production. Additionally, microscopic structure
      observation combined with FT-IR and XRD analysis illustrated the structural
      disruption of pretreated rice straw, and the crystalline index of rice straw can 
      be decreased by 46.2% after pretreatment, which might account for the hydrogen
      production enhancement. The results also indicated that the hydrogen yield from
      pretreated rice straw was not affected without the addition of yeast extract and 
      vitamins to the culture medium, which is substantial evidence that edible fungal 
      pretreated rice straw could provide prerequisite nutrients for hydrogen-producing
      bacteria. Overall, edible fungal pretreatment has great potential under the mild 
      conditions for high hydrogen yields and thus leads to a new direction to realize 
      a highly efficient and economically competitive biological hydrogen production
      process from lignocellulosic biomass.

      adding a typical nutrient solution for hydrogen production was investigated.
      Nutrients include N-NH4, Mg, Fe, Co, Mn, I, Ni, and Zn. The best hydrogen
      production potential was obtained at a COD of 50 g L(-1) without nutrient
      addition. This condition produced 528 mL H2 L(-1). At a COD >/= 35 g L(-1), tests
      with only WW had a hydrogen potential 1.6 to 1.9 times higher than did tests
      where nutrients were added. The use of added nutrients reduced the hydrogen
      production by producing additional reduced acids, such as propionate and
      valerate. In a second stage, biomethane potential was evaluated using the
      effluent of a selected condition from hydrogen production tests. The methane
      production reached values of 207 +/- 2.2 mL CH4 g(-1) COD at 10 g COD L(-1). The 
      COD affected the specific methane production. The results of this study
      demonstrated the potential of winery effluents as a substrate for sequential
      hydrogen and methane production to increase the energy recovery from this
      effluent, with a maximum energetic yield and productivity of 7.15 kJ gCOD(-1) and
      11.51 kJ d(-1).

AB  - Wastewater biological treatment with microalgae can be an effective technology,
      removing nutrients and other contaminants while reducing chemical oxygen demand. 
      This can be particularly interesting for the meat producing industry which
      produces large volumes of wastewater from the slaughtering of animals and
      cleaning of their facilities. The main purpose of this research was the treatment
      of poultry wastewater using Scenedesmus obliquus in an economical and
      environmentally sustainable way. Two wastewaters were collected from a Portuguese
      poultry slaughterhouse (poultry raw - PR and poultry flocculated - PF) and the
      bioremediation was evaluated. The performance of microalga biomass growth and
      biochemical composition were assessed for two illumination sources (fluorescent
      vs LEDs). S. obliquus achieved positive results when grown in highly contaminated
      agro-industrial wastewater from the poultry industry, independently of the light 
      source. The wastewater bioremediation revealed results higher than 97% for both
      ammonium and phosphate removal efficiency, for a cultivation time of 13 days. The
      saponifiable matter obtained from the biomass of the microalga cultures was, on
      average, 11% and 27% (m/malga) with PR and PF wastewater, respectively. In
      opposition, higher sugar content was obtained from microalgae biomass grown in PR
      wastewater (average 34% m/malga) in comparison to PF wastewater (average 23%
      m/malga), independently of the illumination source. Therefore, biomass obtained
      with PR wastewater will be more appropriate as a raw material for
      bioethanol/biohydrogen production (higher sugar content) while biomass produced
      in PF wastewater will have a similar potential as feedstock for both biodiesel
      and bioethanol/biohydrogen production (similar lipid and sugar content).

AB  - Redox mediators (RM) are natural or artificial compounds used by microorganisms
      as electron acceptors and electron donors during electron transfer. Evidence
      collected in the last years indicates that the application of RM in
      bioelectrochemical systems (BES) enhanced the electron transfer from
      microorganisms to anodes and from cathodes to microorganisms. This review
      summarizes the results of using soluble or immobilized RM in BES to produce
      electricity and for the treatment of contaminants from wastewater effluents. In
      addition, future research focused on biohydrogen production, recovery or removal 
      metals, and the use of humic substances (HS) extracted from natural environment
      is proposed.

AB  - Most photosynthetic organisms store and convert solar energy in an aerobic
      process and produce biomass for various uses. Utilization of biomass for the
      production of renewable energy carriers employs anaerobic conditions. This review
      focuses on microalgal biomass and its use for biological hydrogen and methane
      production. Microalgae offer several advantages compared to terrestrial plants.
      Strategies to maintain anaerobic environment for biohydrogen production are
      summarized. Efficient biogas production via anaerobic digestion is significantly 
      affected by the biomass composition, pretreatment strategies and the parameters
      of the digestion process. Coupled biohydrogen and biogas production increases the
      efficiency and sustainability of renewable energy production.

PG  - 244

AB  - Hydrogen photoproduction from microalgae has been an emerging topic for biofuel
      development. However, low yield for large-scale cultivations seems to be the main
      challenge. Immobilization seems to be an alternative method for sustainable
      hydrogen generation. In this study we examined the bead stability, bead diameter 
      and immobilization method in accordance with photobioreactors (PBR). 2.1 mm
      diameter beads were selected for PBR experiments. CSTR, tubular and panel type
      PBRs give important results to develop suitable immobilization matrixes and
      techniques for mass production in scalable PBR systems. In conclusion, we suggest
      to develop techniques specific for the design and operation characteristic of the
      PBR for a yield efficient hydrogen generation.

TI  - An endogenous microRNA (miRNA1166.1) can regulate photobio-H2 production in
      eukaryotic green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.
PG  - 126
LID - 10.1186/s13068-018-1126-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hydrogen photoproduction from green microalgae is regarded as a
      promising alternative solution for energy problems. However, the simultaneous
      oxygen evolution from microalgae can prevent continuous hydrogen production due
      to the hypersensitivity of hydrogenases to oxygen. Sulfur deprivation can extend 
      the duration of algal hydrogen production, but it is uneconomical to alternately 
      culture algal cells in sulfur-sufficient and sulfur-deprived media. RESULTS: In
      this study, we developed a novel way to simulate sulfur-deprivation treatment
      while constantly maintaining microalgal cells in sulfur-sufficient culture medium
      by overexpressing an endogenous microRNA (miR1166.1). Based on our previous
      RNA-seq analysis in the model green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, three
      endogenous miRNAs responsive to sulfur deprivation (cre-miR1166.1, cre-miR1150.3,
      and cre-miR1158) were selected. Heat-inducible expression vectors containing the 
      selected miRNAs were constructed and transformed into C. reinhardtii. Comparison 
      of H2 production following heat induction in the three transgenic strains and
      untransformed control group identified miR1166.1 as the best candidate for H2
      production regulation. Moreover, enhanced photobio-H2 production was observed
      with repeated induction of miR1166.1 expression. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the
      first to identify a physiological function of endogenous miR1166.1 and to show
      that a natural miRNA can regulate hydrogen photoproduction in the unicellular
      model organism C. reinhardtii.

AB  - This study investigated the kinetic parameters of high-rate continuous
      performance and biofilm layer formation in a H2-producing dynamic membrane
      bioreactor, composed of a continuously stirred tank reactor along with an
      external module containing polyester mesh with a pore size of 100microm. A
      maximum H2 production rate of 48.9L/L-day and hydrogen yield of 2.8mol/mol
      glucoseadded were attained at a hydraulic retention time of 3h. The maximum
      specific growth rate and Monod constant were estimated as 14.92d(-1) and
      1.02gCOD/L, respectively. During the entire operation without backwashing, the
      transmembrane pressure remained below 1.7kPa, while tightly bound extracellular
      polymeric substances increased as the dynamic membrane was developed. Fluorescent
      in situ hybridization and quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays revealed 
      that Clostridium butyricum was dominant in all samples; however, the biofilm had 
      a higher proportion of Prevotella spp. than the fermentation liquor.

TI  - In-vivo turnover frequency of the cyanobacterial NiFe-hydrogenase during
      photohydrogen production outperforms in-vitro systems.
PG  - 6083
LID - 10.1038/s41598-018-24430-y [doi]
AB  - Cyanobacteria provide all components for sunlight driven biohydrogen production. 
      Their bidirectional NiFe-hydrogenase is resistant against low levels of oxygen
      with a preference for hydrogen evolution. However, until now it was unclear if
      its catalytic efficiency can keep pace with the photosynthetic electron transfer 
      rate. We identified NikKLMQO (sll0381-sll0385) as a nickel transporter, which is 
      required for hydrogen production. ICP-MS measurements were used to quantify
      hydrogenase molecules per cell. We found 400 to 2000 hydrogenase molecules per
      cell depending on the conditions. In-vivo turnover frequencies of the enzyme
      ranged from 62 H2/s in the wild type to 120 H2/s in a mutant during photohydrogen
      production. These frequencies are above maximum in-vivo photosynthetic electron
      transfer rates of 47 e(-)/s (equivalent to 24 H2/s). They are also above those of
      existing in-vitro systems working with unlimited electron supply and show that
      in-vivo photohydrogen production is limited by electron delivery to the enzyme.

LID - 10.1007/s12088-017-0703-z [doi]
AB  - Wastewaters are a rich source of nutrients for microorganisms. However, if left
      unattended the biodegradation may lead to severe environmental hazards. The
      wastewaters can thus be utilized for the production of various value added
      products including bioenergy (H2 and CH4). A number of studies have reported
      utilization of various wastewaters for energy production. Depending on the nature
      of the wastewater, different reactor configurations, wastewater and inoculum
      pretreatments, co-substrate utilizations along with other process parameters have
      been studied for efficient product formation. Only a few studies have reported
      sequential utilization of wastewaters for H2 and CH4 production despite its huge 
      potential for complete waste degradation.

AB  - We report a recycling bioresource involving harvesting of Microcystis aeruginosa 
      using the bioflocculant (MBF-32) produced by Enterobacter aerogenes followed by
      the recovery of the harvested M. aeruginosa as the main substrate for the
      sustainable production of MBF-32 and biohydrogen. The experimental results
      indicate that the efficiency of bioflocculation exceeded 90% under optimal
      conditions. The harvested M. aeruginosa was further recycled as the main
      substrate for the supply of necessary elements. The highest yield (3.6+/-0.1g/L) 
      of MBF-32 could be obtained from 20g/L of wet biomass of M. aeruginosa with an
      additional 20g/L of glucose as the extra carbon source. The highest yield of
      biohydrogen was 35mL of H2/g (dw) algal biomass, obtained from 20g/L of wet
      biomass of M. aeruginosa with an additional 10g/L of glycerol. Transcriptome
      analyses indicated that MBF-32 was mainly composed of polysaccharide and
      tyrosine/tryptophan proteins. Furthermore, NADH synthase and polysaccharide
      export-related genes were found to be up-regulated.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Molecular hydrogen (H2) is an attractive future energy carrier to
      replace fossil fuels. Biologically and sustainably produced H2 could contribute
      significantly to the future energy mix. However, biological H2 production methods
      are faced with multiple barriers including substrate cost, low production rates, 
      and low yields. The C1 compound formate is a promising substrate for biological
      H2 production, as it can be produced itself from various sources including
      electrochemical reduction of CO2 or from synthesis gas. Many microbes that can
      produce H2 from formate have been isolated; however, in most cases H2 production 
      rates cannot compete with other H2 production methods. RESULTS: We established a 
      formate-based H2 production method utilizing the acetogenic bacterium
      Acetobacterium woodii. This organism can use formate as sole energy and carbon
      source and possesses a novel enzyme complex, the hydrogen-dependent CO2 reductase
      that catalyzes oxidation of formate to H2 and CO2. Cell suspensions reached
      specific formate-dependent H2 production rates of 71 mmol gprotein(-1) h(-1)
      (30.5 mmol gCDW(-1) h(-1)) and maximum volumetric H2 evolution rates of 79 mmol
      L(-1) h(-1). Using growing cells in a two-step closed batch fermentation,
      specific H2 production rates reached 66 mmol gCDW(-1) h(-1) with a volumetric H2 
      evolution rate of 7.9 mmol L(-1) h(-1). Acetate was the major side product that
      decreased the H2 yield. We demonstrate that inhibition of the energy metabolism
      by addition of a sodium ionophore is suitable to completely abolish acetate
      formation. Under these conditions, yields up to 1 mol H2 per mol formate were
      achieved. The same ionophore can be used in cultures utilizing formate as
      specific switch from a growing phase to a H2 production phase. CONCLUSIONS:
      Acetobacterium woodii reached one of the highest formate-dependent specific H2
      productivity rates at ambient temperatures reported so far for an organism
      without genetic modification and converted the substrate exclusively to H2. This 
      makes this organism a very promising candidate for sustainable H2 production and,
      because of the reversibility of the A. woodii enzyme, also a candidate for
      reversible H2 storage.

AB  - This study assessed the impact of swine manure (SM) dilution ratio on the
      microalgal biomass cultivation and further tested for biohydrogen production
      efficiency from the mixed microalgal biomass. At first, various solid/liquid
      (S/L) ratio of the SM ranged from 2.5 to 10g/L was prepared as a nutrient medium 
      for the algal biomass cultivation without addition of the external nutrient
      sources over a period of 18d. The peak biomass concentration of 2.57+/-0.03g/L
      was obtained under the initial S/L loading rates of 5g/L. Further, the cultivated
      biomass was subjected to two-step (ultrasonication+enzymatic) pretreatment and
      evaluated for biohydrogen production potential. Results showed that the variable 
      amount of hydrogen production was observed with different S/L ratio of the SM.
      The peak hydrogen yield of 116+/-6mL/g TSadded was observed at the 5g/L grown SM 
      mixed algal biomass.

TI  - Anaerobic phototrophic processes of hydrogen production by different strains of
      microalgae Chlamydomonas sp.
LID - 10.1093/femsle/fny073 [doi]
AB  - Hydrogen is an abundant element and a non-polluting fuel that can be biologically
      produced by microalgae. The aim of this research was to investigate biological
      hydrogen production by Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (CC425) and Chlamydomonas
      moewusii (SAG 24.91) by direct biophotolysis in batch cultures. Strains were
      cultivated in TAP growth medium (pH 7.2) in two phases: in the first stage,
      cultures were maintained in an aerobic condition until the middle of the
      exponential phase; in the second stage, the biomass was transferred to closed
      anaerobic photobioreactors under sulfur deprived. Gas chromatography and Gompertz
      model were used to measure the hydrogen production and hydrogen production rate, 
      respectively. We noticed that maximum hydrogen production by biomass of C.
      reinhardtii was 5.95 +/- 0.88 mumol mg-1 and the productivity was 17.02 +/- 3.83 
      mumol L-1 h-1, with hydrogen production five times higher than C. moewusii,
      approximately, though, C. moewusii obtained a higher ethanol yield compared to C.
      reinhardtii. The hydrogen production method, with the cultivation of strains in
      two different phases and sulfur deprivation, was effective for obtaining of
      biohydrogen for Chlamydomonas; however, it depends on the species, strain and
      growth conditions.

AB  - AIM: The aim of this research was to create a work scheme for the isolation of
      the different micro-organisms commonly found in hydrogen-producing reactors and
      to test its effectiveness. METHODS AND RESULTS: Methods were selected to isolate 
      anaerobic spore-forming fermenters, anaerobic fermenters that do not form spores,
      facultative aerobic fermenters and lactic acid bacteria. The methods were tested 
      in two samples taken from a hydrogen-producing reactor fed with cheese whey. 16S 
      rRNA gene sequences from isolates were compared with pyrosequencing analysis from
      the same samples. The isolates represented more than 88% of the abundance
      detected by pyrosequencing. Organisms from the genera Clostridium, Rahnella,
      Megasphaera, Lactobacillus, Propionibacterium, Bifidobacterium, Chryseobacterium 
      and Acetobacter were isolated. Hydrogen-producing capacity was confirmed for the 
      Clostridium, Rahnella and Megasphaera isolates. Coculture experiments indicate
      that Megasphaera prevented the total inhibition of Clostridium by Lactobacillus. 
      CONCLUSION: The work scheme proposed was effective to isolate most of the
      micro-organisms detected by pyrosequencing analysis. Physiological studies
      suggested a key role of Megasphaera. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: We
      showed the high culturability of the microbial communities from
      hydrogen-producing bioreactors. The isolates can be used to perform physiological
      studies to understand the H2 -producing process.

TI  - Water-splitting-based, sustainable and efficient H2 production in green algae as 
      achieved by substrate limitation of the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle.
PG  - 69
LID - 10.1186/s13068-018-1069-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Photobiological H2 production has the potential of becoming a
      carbon-free renewable energy source, because upon the combustion of H2, only
      water is produced. The [Fe-Fe]-type hydrogenases of green algae are highly
      active, although extremely O2-sensitive. Sulphur deprivation is a common way to
      induce H2 production, which, however, relies substantially on organic substrates 
      and imposes a severe stress effect resulting in the degradation of the
      photosynthetic apparatus. RESULTS: We report on the establishment of an
      alternative H2 production method by green algae that is based on a short
      anaerobic induction, keeping the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle inactive by
      substrate limitation and preserving hydrogenase activity by applying a simple
      catalyst to remove the evolved O2. Cultures remain photosynthetically active for 
      several days, with the electrons feeding the hydrogenases mostly derived from
      water. The amount of H2 produced is higher as compared to the sulphur-deprivation
      procedure and the process is photoautotrophic. CONCLUSION: Our protocol
      demonstrates that it is possible to sustainably use algal cells as whole-cell
      catalysts for H2 production, which enables industrial application of algal
      biohydrogen production.

TI  - Biohydrogen production from fermentation of cotton stalk hydrolysate by
      Klebsiella sp. WL1316 newly isolated from wild carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) of the
      Tarim River basin.

AB  - A new hydrogen-producing bacterium was isolated from the intestine of wild carp
      (Cyprinus carpio L.) of the Tarim River Basin. The isolate was identified as
      Klebsiella sp. based on 16S rDNA gene sequencing and examination of physiological
      and biochemical characteristics. The isolated strain, Klebsiella sp. WL1316,
      could effectively produce a high yield of hydrogen by using cotton stalk
      hydrolysate as substrate. The optimum fermentation conditions for hydrogen
      production were determined as follows: an initial sugar concentration of 40 g/L, 
      a fermentation temperature of 37 degrees C and an initial pH value of 8.0. The
      scaled-up fermentation process was conducted in a 5-L fermenter using these
      parameters. Higher productivities with maximum daily hydrogen production of 937.0
      +/- 41.0 mL L(-1) day(-1), cumulative hydrogen production of 2908.5 +/- 47.4 mL
      L(-1), viable cell count of (20.2 +/- 0.6) x 10(8) CFU mL(-1) and hydrogen yield 
      of 1.44 +/- 0.08 mol mol(-1)sugarconsumed were obtained. The cumulative hydrogen 
      production was predicted by the modified Gompertz equation with R (2) of 0.997,
      and values of R m and P were 44.8 mL L(-1) h(-1) and 3057.6 mL L(-1),
      respectively. These results indicated that the strain Klebsiella sp. WL1316
      resulted in a high hydrogen production rate (HPR) and good hydrogen production
      potential. Moreover, this strain exhibited higher values of maximum hydrogen
      yield and HPR than the reported pure cultures.

TI  - Engineering cellulolytic bacterium Clostridium thermocellum to co-ferment
      cellulose- and hemicellulose-derived sugars simultaneously.
PG  - 1755-1763
LID - 10.1002/bit.26590 [doi]
AB  - Cellulose and hemicellulose are the most abundant components in plant biomass. A 
      preferred Consolidated Bioprocessing (CBP) system is one which can directly
      convert both cellulose and hemicellulose into target products without adding the 
      costly hydrolytic enzyme cocktail. In this work, the thermophilic, cellulolytic, 
      and anaerobic bacterium, Clostridium thermocellum DSM 1313, was engineered to
      grow on xylose in addition to cellulose. Both xylA (encoding for xylose
      isomerase) and xylB (encoding for xylulokinase) genes from the thermophilic
      anaerobic bacterium Thermoanaerobacter ethanolicus were introduced to enable
      xylose utilization while still retaining its inherent ability to grow on 6-carbon
      substrates. Targeted integration of xylAB into C. thermocellum genome realized
      simultaneous fermentation of xylose with glucose, with cellobiose (glucose
      dimer), and with cellulose, respectively, without carbon catabolite repression.
      We also showed that the respective H2 and ethanol production were twice as much
      when both xylose and cellulose were consumed simultaneously than when consuming
      cellulose alone. Moreover, the engineered xylose consumer can also utilize
      xylo-oligomers (with degree of polymerization of 2-7) in the presence of xylose. 
      Isotopic tracer studies also revealed that the engineered xylose catabolism
      contributed to the production of ethanol from xylan which is a model
      hemicellulose in mixed sugar fermentation, demonstrating immense potential of
      this enhanced CBP strain in co-utilizing both cellulose and hemicellulose for the
      production of fuels and chemicals.

AB  - Extensive effort is being made to explore renewable energy in replacing fossil
      fuels. Biohydrogen is a promising future fuel because of its clean and high
      energy content. A challenging issue in establishing hydrogen economy is
      sustainability. Biohydrogen has the potential for renewable biofuel, and could
      replace current hydrogen production through fossil fuel thermo-chemical
      processes. A promising source of biohydrogen is conversion from algal biomass,
      which is abundant, clean and renewable. Unlike other well-developed biofuels such
      as bioethanol and biodiesel, production of hydrogen from algal biomass is still
      in the early stage of development. There are a variety of technologies for algal 
      hydrogen production, and some laboratory- and pilot-scale systems have
      demonstrated a good potential for full-scale implementation. This work presents
      an elucidation on development in biohydrogen encompassing biological pathways,
      bioreactor designs and operation and techno-economic evaluation. Challenges and
      prospects of biohydrogen production are also outlined.

AB  - The ability of microalgae to grow in nutrient-rich environments and to accumulate
      nutrients from wastewaters (WW) makes them attractive for the sustainable and
      low-cost treatment of WW. The valuable biomass produced can be further used for
      the generation of bioenergy, animal feed, fertilizers, and biopolymers, among
      others. In this study, Scenedesmus obliquus was able to remove nutrients from
      different wastewaters (poultry, swine and cattle breeding, brewery and dairy
      industries, and urban) with removal ranges of 95-100% for nitrogen, 63-99% for
      phosphorus and 48-70% for chemical oxygen demand. The biomass productivity using 
      wastewaters was higher (except for poultry) than in synthetic medium (Bristol),
      the highest value being obtained in brewery wastewater (1025mg/(L.day) of
      freeze-dried biomass). The produced biomass contained 31-53% of proteins, 12-36% 
      of sugars and 8-23% of lipids, regardless of the type of wastewater. The
      potential of the produced Scenedesmus obliquus biomass for the generation of
      BioH2 through batch dark fermentation processes with Enterobacter aerogenes was
      evaluated. The obtained yields ranged, in mL H2/g Volatile Solids (VS), from 50.1
      for biomass from anaerobically digested cattle WW to 390 for swine WW, whereas
      the yield with biomass cultivated in Bristol medium was 57.6mL H2/gVS.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sustainable biofuels, which are widely considered as an attractive
      alternative to fossil fuels, can be generated by utilizing various biomass from
      the environment. Marine biomass, such as red algal biomass, is regarded as one
      potential renewable substrate source for biofuels conversion due to its abundance
      of fermentable sugars (e.g., galactose). Previous studies focused on the
      enhancement of biofuels production from different Clostridium species; however,
      there has been limited investigation into their metabolic pathways, especially on
      the conversion of biofuels from galactose, via whole genomic comparison and
      evolutionary analysis. RESULTS: Two galactose-utilizing Clostridial strains were 
      examined and identified as Clostridium acetobutylicum strain WA and C.
      beijerinckii strain WB. Via the genomic sequencing of both strains, the
      comparison of the whole genome together with the relevant protein prediction of
      33 other Clostridium species was established to reveal a clear genome profile
      based upon various genomic features. Among them, five representative strains,
      including C. beijerinckii NCIMB14988, C. diolis DSM 15410, C. pasteurianum BC1,
      strain WA and WB, were further discussed to demonstrate the main differences
      among their respective metabolic pathways, especially in their carbohydrate
      metabolism. The metabolic pathways involved in the generation of biofuels and
      other potential products (e.g., riboflavin) were also reconstructed based on the 
      utilization of marine biomass. Finally, a batch fermentation process was
      performed to verify the fermentative products from strains WA and WB using 60 g/L
      of galactose, which is the main hydrolysate from algal biomass. It was observed
      that strain WA and WB could produce up to 16.98 and 12.47 g/L of biobutanol,
      together with 21,560 and 10,140 mL/L biohydrogen, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      determination of the production of various biofuels by both strains WA and WB and
      their genomic comparisons with other typical Clostridium species on the analysis 
      of various metabolic pathways was presented. Through the identification of their 
      metabolic pathways, which are involved in the conversion of galactose into
      various potential products, such as biobutanol, the obtained results extend the
      current insight into the potential capability of utilizing marine red algal
      biomass and provide a systematic investigation into the relationship between this
      genus and the generation of sustainable bioenergy.

AB  - The enhancement of two-stage anaerobic digestion of polysaccharide-enriched food 
      waste by the addition of cysteine-an oxygen scavenger, electron mediator, and
      nitrogen source-to the acidification stage was reported. It was found that in the
      acidification stage the accumulation of volatile fatty acids (VFA), which mainly 
      consisted of acetate, butyrate, and propionate, was increased by 49.3% at a
      cysteine dosage of 50 mg/L. Although some cysteine was biodegraded in the
      acidification stage, the VFA derived from cysteine was negligible. In the
      methanogenesis stage, the biotransformations of both VFA and biohydrogen to
      methane were enhanced, and the methane yield was improved by 43.9%. The
      mechanisms study showed that both d-glucose and l-glucose (the model
      monosaccharides) were detectable in the hydrolysis product, and the addition of
      cysteine remarkably increased the acidification of l-glucose, especially acetic
      acid and hydrogen generation, due to key enzymes involved in l-glucose metabolism
      being enhanced. Cysteine also improved the activity of homoacetogens by 34.8% and
      hydrogenotrophic methanogens by 54%, which might be due to the electron transfer 
      process being accelerated. This study provided an alternative method to improve
      anaerobic digestion performance and energy recovery from food waste.

TI  - Improved photobio-H2 production regulated by artificial miRNA targeting psbA in
      green microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.
PG  - 36
LID - 10.1186/s13068-018-1030-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sulfur-deprived cultivation of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, referred as
      "two-stage culture" transferring the cells from regular algal medium to
      sulfur-deplete one, has been extensively studied to improve photobio-H2
      production in this green microalga. During sulfur-deprivation treatment, the
      synthesis of a key component of photosystem II complex, D1 protein, was inhibited
      and improved photobio-H2 production could be established in C. reinhardtii.
      However, separation of algal cells from a regular liquid culture medium to a
      sulfur-deprived one is not only a discontinuous process, but also a cost- and
      time-consuming operation. More applicable and economic alternatives for sustained
      H2 production by C. reinhardtii are still highly required. RESULTS: In the
      present study, a significant improvement in photobio-H2 production was observed
      in the transgenic green microalga C. reinhardtii, which employed a newly designed
      strategy based on a heat-inducible artificial miRNA (amiRNA) expression system
      targeting D1-encoded gene, psbA. A transgenic algal strain referred as
      "amiRNA-D1" has been successfully obtained by transforming the expression vector 
      containing a heat-inducible promoter. After heat shock conducted in the same
      algal cultures, the expression of amiRNA-D1 was detected increased 15-fold
      accompanied with a 73% decrease of target gene psbA. More interestingly, this
      transgenic alga accumulated about 60% more H2 content than the wild-type strain
      CC-849 at the end of 7-day cultivation. CONCLUSIONS: The photobio-H2 production
      in the engineered transgenic alga was significantly improved. Without imposing
      any nutrient-deprived stress, this novel strategy provided a convenient and
      efficient way for regulation of photobio-H2 production in green microalga by
      simply "turn on" the expression of a designed amiRNA.

AB  - Microalgae are simple chlorophyll containing organisms, they have high
      photosynthetic efficiency and can synthesize and accumulate large quantities of
      carbohydrate biomass. They can be cultivated in fresh water, seawater and
      wastewater. They have been used as feedstock for producing biodiesel, bioethanol 
      and biogas. The production of these biofuels can be integrated with CO2
      mitigation, wastewater treatment, and the production of high-value chemicals.
      Biohydrogen from microalgae is renewable. Microalgae have several advantages
      compared to terrestrial plants, such as higher growth rate with superior CO2
      fixation capacity; they do not need arable land to grow; they do not contain
      lignin. In this review, the biology of microalgae and the chemical composition of
      microalgae were briefly introduced, the advantages and disadvantages of hydrogen 
      production from microalgae were discussed, and the pretreatment of microalgal
      biomass and the fermentative hydrogen production from microalgal biomass
      pretreated by different methods (including physical, chemical, biological and
      combined methods) were summarized and evaluated. For the production of
      biohydrogen from microalgae, the economic feasibility remains the most important 
      aspect to consider. Several technological and economic issues must be addressed
      to achieve success on a commercial scale.

AB  - This study assesses the impact of different support materials (Mutag BioChip,
      expanded clay and activated carbon) on microbial hydrogen production in an
      anaerobic packed-bed reactor (APBR) treating synthetic waste water containing
      glucose as the main carbon source at low pH value. The APBRs were inoculated with
      acid pretreated anaerobic sludge and operated at pH value of 4+/-0.2 and
      hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 3h. The maximum hydrogen yield of 1.80mol
      H2/mol glucose was achieved for the APBR packed with Mutag BioChip (R1), followed
      by expanded clay (R2, 1.74mol H2/mol glucose) and activated carbon (R3, 1.46mol
      H2/mol glucose). It was observed that the investigated support materials
      influenced the immobilization of hydrogen producing bacteria and consequently
      hydrogen production performance as well as composition of soluble metabolites.
      The main metabolic products were acetic acid and butyric acid accompanied with a 
      smaller content of ethanol. The data indicated that in reactors with higher
      hydrogen yield (R1 and R2), acetate/butyrate (HAc/HBu) ratios were 1.7 and 1.6,
      respectively, while in the reactor with the lowest hydrogen yield (R3) the
      obtained HAc/HBu ratio was 4.8. Finally, stable hydrogen and organic acids
      production throughout the steady-state operation period at low pH values was
      achieved in all reactors.

AB  - The present study aimed to increase the disintegration potential of marine
      macroalgae, (Ulva reticulata) through chemo mechanical pretreatment (CMP) in an
      energy efficient manner. By combining surfactant with disperser, the specific
      energy input was considerably reduced from 437.1kJ/kg TS to 264.9kJ/kg TS to
      achieve 10.7% liquefaction. A disperser rpm (10,000), pretreatment time (30min)
      and tween 80 dosage (21.6mg/L) were considered as an optimum for effective
      liquefaction of algal biomass. CMP was designated as an appropriate pretreatment 
      resulting in a higher soluble organic release 1250mg/L, respectively. Anaerobic
      fermentation results revealed that the volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentration
      was doubled (782mg/L) in CMP when compared to mechanical pretreatment (MP)
      (345mg/L). CMP pretreated algal biomass was considered as the suitable for
      biohydrogen production with highest H2 yield of about 63mL H2/g COD than (MP)
      (45mL H2/g COD) and control (10mL H2/g COD).

AB  - Human waste simulants were for the first time converted into biohydrogen by a
      newly developed anaerobic microbial consortium via thermophilic consolidated
      bioprocessing. Four different BioH2-producing consortia (denoted as C1, C2, C3
      and C4) were isolated, and developed using human waste simulants as substrate.
      The thermophilic consortium C3, which contained Thermoanaerobacterium,
      Caloribacterium, and Caldanaerobius species as the main constituents, showed the 
      highest BioH2 production (3.999mmol/g) from human waste simulants under optimized
      conditions (pH 7.0 and 60 degrees C). The consortium C3 also produced significant
      amounts of BioH2 (5.732mmol/g and 2.186mmol/g) using wastewater and activated
      sludge, respectively. The developed consortium in this study is a promising
      candidate for H2 production in space applications as in situ resource
      utilization.

AB  - The generation of biohydrogen as source of biofuel/bioenergy from the wide
      variety of biomass has gathered a substantial quantum of research efforts in
      several aspects. One of the major thrusts in this field has been the pursuit of
      technically sound and effective methods and/or approaches towards significant
      improvement in the bioconversion efficiency and enhanced biohydrogen yields. In
      this perspective, the present contribution showcases the views formulated based
      on the latest advances reported in dark fermentative biohydrogen production
      (DHFP), which is considered as the most feasible route for commercialization of
      biohydrogen. The potential prospects and future research avenues are also
      presented.

AB  - Three newly discovered H2 producing bacteria namely Clostridium perfringens
      strain JJC, Clostridium bifermentans strain WYM and Clostridium sp. strain Ade.TY
      originated from landfill leachate sludge have demonstrated highly efficient H2
      production. The maximum H2 production attained from these isolates are in the
      descending order of strain C. perfringens strain JJC > C. bifermentans strain WYM
      > Clostridium sp. strain Ade.TY with yield of 4.68 +/- 0.12, 3.29 +/- 0.11, and
      2.87 +/- 0.10 mol H2/mol glucose, respectively. The result has broken the
      conventional theoretical yield of 4 mol H2/mol glucose. These isolates were
      thermodynamically favourable with Gibbs free energy between -33 and -35 kJ/mol
      (under process conditions: pH 6, 37 degrees C and 5 g/L glucose). All three
      isolates favour butyrate pathway for H2 production with the ratio of acetate and 
      butyrate of 0.77, 0.65 and 0.80 for strain JJC, WYM and Ade.TY, respectively.
      This study reported provides a new insight on the potential of unique bacteria in
      H2 production.

AB  - The effects of substrate concentration on fermentative hydrogen production from
      galactose at a fixed hydraulic retention time of 12 h were investigated in an
      immobilized continuously stirred tank reactor. Peak hydrogen production rate and 
      hydrogen yield of 9.57 L/L-d and 1.10 mol/mol galactoseadded, respectively, were 
      obtained at a feed substrate concentration of 30 g/L and an organic loading rate 
      of 60 L/L-d. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that the
      variations in the performance resulted primarily from metabolic alterations
      within the metabolism of the established microbial community rather than
      modifications in the population. The results obtained showed that optimal
      substrate concentration is essential for the efficient, continuous production of 
      hydrogen from galactose.

AB  - The hydrogen (H2) production efficiency in dark fermentation systems is strongly 
      dependent on the occurrence of metabolic pathways derived from the selection of
      microbial species that either consume molecular H2 or outcompete hydrogenogenic
      bacteria for the organic substrate. In this study, the effect of organic loading 
      rate (OLR) on the H2 production performance, the metabolic pathways, and the
      microbial community composition in a continuous system was evaluated. Two
      bacterial genera, Clostridium and Streptococcus, were dominant in the microbial
      community depending on the OLR applied. At low OLR (14.7-44.1 gLactose/L-d),
      Clostridium sp. was dominant and directed the system towards the acetate-butyrate
      fermentation pathway, with a maximum H2 yield of 2.14 molH2/molHexose obtained at
      29.4 gLactose/L-d. Under such conditions, the volumetric hydrogen production rate
      (VHPR) was between 3.2 and 11.6 LH2/L-d. In contrast, relatively high OLR (58.8
      and 88.2 gLactose/L-d) favored the dominance of Streptococcus sp. as co-dominant 
      microorganism leading to lactate production. Under these conditions, the formate 
      production was also stimulated serving as a strategy to dispose the surplus of
      reduced molecules (e.g., NADH2(+)), which theoretically consumed up to 5.72
      LH2/L-d. In such scenario, the VHPR was enhanced (13.7-14.5 LH2/L-d) but the H2
      yield dropped to a minimum of 0.74 molH2/molHexose at OLR = 58.8 gLactose/L-d.
      Overall, this research brings clear evidence of the intrinsic occurrence of
      metabolic pathways detrimental for biohydrogen production, i.e., lactic acid
      fermentation and formate production, suggesting the use of low OLR as a strategy 
      to control them.

AB  - Pilot tests of sequential dark and photo fermentation H2 production were for the 
      first time conducted in a 11m(3) reactor (3m(3) for dark and 8m(3) for photo
      compartments). A combined solar and light-emitting diode illumination system and 
      a thermal controlling system was installed and tested. With dark fermentation
      unit maintained at pH 4.5 and 35 degrees C and photo fermentation unit at pH 7.0 
      and 30 degrees C, the overall biogas production rate using hydrolyzed corn stover
      as substrate reached 87.8+/-3.8m(3)/d with 68% H2 content, contributed by dark
      unit at 7.5m(3)-H2/m(3)-d and by photo unit at 4.7m(3)/m(3)-d. Large variation
      was noted for H2 production rate in different compartments of the tested units,
      revealing the adverse effects of poor mixing, washout, and other inhomogeneity
      associated with large reactor operations.

AB  - Microbial electrohydrogenesis cells (MECs) are devices that have attracted
      significant attention from the scientific community to generate hydrogen gas
      electrochemically with the aid of exoelectrogen microorganisms. It has been
      demonstrated that MECs are capable to deal with the residual organic materials
      present in effluents generated along with dark fermentative hydrogen
      bioproduction (DF). Consequently, MECs stand as attractive post-treatment units
      to enhance the global H2 yield as a part of a two-stage, integrated application
      (DF-MEC). In this review article, it is aimed (i) to assess results communicated 
      in the relevant literature on cascade DF-MEC systems, (ii) describe the
      characteristics of each steps involved and (iii) discuss the experiences as well 
      as the lessons in order to facilitate knowledge transfer and help the interested 
      readers with the construction of more efficient coupled set-ups, leading
      eventually to the improvement of overall biohydrogen evolution performances.

      fermentation effluents that are mainly rich in volatile fatty acids such as
      acetate and butyrate. Various enhancement and alternative routes such as photo
      fermentation, anaerobic digestion, utilization of microbial electrochemical
      systems, and algal system towards the generation of bioenergy and electricity and
      also for efficient organic matter utilization are highlighted. What is more,
      various integration schemes and two-stage fermentation for the possible scale up 
      are reviewed. Moreover, recent progress for enhanced performance towards waste
      stabilization and overall utilization of useful and higher COD present in the
      organic source into value-added products are extensively discussed.

AB  - In this study a novel modeling approach for describing fermentative hydrogen
      production in a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) was developed, using the
      Aquasim modeling platform. This model accounts for the key metabolic reactions
      taking place in a fermentative hydrogen producing reactor, using fixed
      stoichiometry but different reaction rates. Biomass yields are determined based
      on bioenergetics. The model is capable of describing very well the variation in
      the distribution of metabolic products for a wide range of hydraulic retention
      times (HRT). The modeling approach is demonstrated using the experimental data
      obtained from a CSTR, fed with food industry waste (FIW), operating at different 
      HRTs. The kinetic parameters were estimated through fitting to the experimental
      results. Hydrogen and total biogas production rates were predicted very well by
      the model, validating the basic assumptions regarding the implicated
      stoichiometric biochemical reactions and their kinetic rates.

AB  - In this study, the biohydrogen (bioH2) production of a microbial consortium was
      optimized by adjusting the type and configuration of two impellers, the mixing
      regimen and the mass transfer process (KLa coefficients). A continuous
      stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) system, with a nonstandard geometry, was
      characterized. Two different mixing configurations with either predominant axial 
      (PB4 impeller) or radial pumping (Rushton impeller) were assessed and four
      different impeller configurations to produce bioH2. The best configuration for an
      adequate mixing time was determined by an ANOVA analysis. A response surface
      methodology was also used to fully elucidate the optimal configuration. When the 
      PB4 impellers were placed in best configuration, c/Dt = 0.5, s/Di = 1, the
      maximum bioH2 productivity obtained was 440 mL L(-1) hr(-1), with a bioH2 molar
      yield of 1.8. The second best configuration obtained with the PB4 impellers
      presented a bioH2 productivity of 407.94 mL L(-1) hr(-1). The configurations
      based on Rushton impellers showed a lower bioH2 productivity and bioH2 molar
      yield of 177.065 mL L(-1) hr(-1) and 0.71, respectively. The experiments with
      axial impellers (PB4) showed the lowest KLa coefficient and the highest bioH2
      production, suggesting that mixing is more important than KLa for the enhanced
      production of bioH2.

AB  - Cyanobacterial mats are laminated microbial ecosystems which occur in highly
      diverse environments and which may provide a possible model for early life on
      Earth. Their ability to produce hydrogen also makes them of interest from a
      biotechnological and bioenergy perspective. Samples of an intertidal microbial
      mat from the Elkhorn Slough estuary in Monterey Bay, California, were
      transplanted to a greenhouse at NASA Ames Research Center to study a 24-h diel
      cycle, in the presence or absence of molybdate (which inhibits biohydrogen
      consumption by sulfate reducers). Here, we present metagenomic analyses of four
      samples that will be used as references for future metatranscriptomic analyses of
      this diel time series.

AB  - Hydrogen generation from complex substrates composed of simple sugars has the
      potential to mitigate future worldwide energy demand. The biohydrogen potential
      of a sequential microaerobic dark- and photo-fermentative system was investigated
      using immobilized Rhodobacter capsulatus JP91. Biological hydrogen production
      from glucose was carried out using a batch process and a bench-scale bioreactor. 
      Response surface methodology with a Box-Behnken design was employed to optimize
      key parameters such as inoculum concentration, oxygen concentration, and glucose 
      concentration. The maximum hydrogen production (21+/-0.25mmolH2/L) and yield
      (7.8+/-0.1molH2/mol glucose) were obtained at 6mM glucose, 4.5% oxygen and
      62.5v/v% inoculum concentration, demonstrating the feasibility of enhanced
      hydrogen production by immobilized R. capsulatus JP91 in a sequential system.
      This is the first time that a sequential process using an immobilized system has 
      been described. This system also achieved the highest hydrogen yield obtained by 
      an immobilized system so far.

AB  - Biological hydrogen production was investigated in continuous acidogenic reactors
      fed with sucrose at 30 degrees C without pH control. In the first experimental
      phase, three reactors were compared: a structured fixed-bed (FB), a granular UASB
      (UG) and a flocculent UASB (UF-1). They were run at 3.3 h HRT and 33 gCOD
      L(-1)d(-1) OLR. Hydrogen production occurred throughout the experimental period
      with an average effluent pH of only 2.8. The FB, UG and UF-1 reactors presented
      volumetric hydrogen production rates (VHPR) of 95 +/- 69, 45 +/- 37 and 54 +/- 32
      mLH2 L(-1)h(-1), respectively; and H2 yields (HY) of 1.5 +/- 0.8, 0.8 +/- 0.6 and
      1.2 +/- 0.7 molH2 mol(-1) sucroseconsumed, respectively. The UF-1 reactor showed 
      intermediate VHPR and HY, but no declining trend, contrary to what was observed
      in the FB reactor. Thus, aiming at continuous and long-term H2 production, a
      flocculent UASB was applied in the second experimental phase. In this phase, the 
      HRT of the acidogenic reactor, which was named UF-2, was raised to 4.6 h,
      resulting in an OLR of 25 gCOD L(-1)d(-1). The VHPR and the HY increased
      considerably to 175 +/- 44 mLH2 L(-1)h(-1) and 3.4 +/- 0.7 molH2 mol(-1)
      sucroseconsumed, respectively. These improvements were accompanied by greater
      sucrose removal, higher suspended biomass concentration, less production of
      lactate and more of acetate, and high ethanol concentration. Contradicting the
      current published literature data that reports strong inhibition of H2 production
      by dark fermentation at pH less than 4.0, the UF-2 reactor presented stable,
      long-term H2 production with satisfactory yields at pH 2.7 on average. 16 S rDNA 
      sequencing revealed that two sequences assigned as Ethanoligenens and Clostridium
      accounted for over 70% of the microbiota in all the reactors. The non-necessity
      of adding alkalizing agents and the successful H2 production under very acid
      conditions, demonstrated in this study, open a new field of investigation in
      biological hydrogen production by dark fermentation towards a more sustainable
      and feasible technology.

AB  - Food waste (FW) management by biological process is more attractive and
      eco-friendly approach than thermo-chemical conversion or landfilling. However, FW
      composition and physico-chemical and biological characteristics affect the
      overall biological process in terms of product yield and degradation rate. To
      overcome this major bottle-neck, the pretreatment of FW is proposed. Therefore
      this review aims to provide a comprehensive summary of the importance of
      pretreatment of FW with respect to FW management by anaerobic digestion (AD) and 
      dark fermentation (DF). It also reviews the existing knowledge gaps and future
      research perspectives for better integration of FW pretreatments for AD and DF,
      which should include (i) the preservation of carbon mass through freeze and thaw,
      or drying; and (ii) improve the carbon accessibility through particle size
      reduction and thermal pretreatments for high-rate bioenergy recovery.

AB  - An innovative method was introduced to inhibit methanogenic H2 consumption during
      dark fermentative hydrogen production by anaerobic mixed cultures. Waste frying
      oil was used as an inhibitor for hydrogenotrophic methanogens. Simultaneous
      effect of waste frying oil concentrations (0-20g/L) and initial pH (5.5, 6.5 and 
      7.5) on inhibition of methanogenic H2 consumption and enhancement of H2
      accumulation were investigated using glucose as substrate. Enhanced hydrogen
      yields with decreased methane productions were observed with increasing the waste
      frying oil concentrations. On average, CH4 productions from glucose in the
      cultures received 10g/L WFO were reduced by 88%. Increased WFO concentration up
      to 20g/L led to negligible CH4 productions and in turn enhanced H2 yields.
      Hydrogen yields of 209.26, 195.35 and 185.60mL/g glucoseadded were obtained for
      the cultures pre-treated with 20g/L waste frying oil with initial pH of 5.5, 6.5 
      and 7.5 respectively. H2 production by pre-treated cultures was also studied
      using a synthetic food waste. Anaerobic mixed cultures were pre-treated with
      10g/L WFO and varying durations (0, 24 and 48h). A H2 yield of 71.46mL/g VS was
      obtained for cultures pre-treated with 10g/L WFO for 48h that was 475% higher
      than untreated control. This study suggests a novel and inexpensive approach for 
      suppressing hydrogenotrophic methanogens during dark fermentative H2 production.

TI  - Impairment of NADH dehydrogenase and regulation of anaerobic metabolism by the
      small RNA RyhB and NadE for improved biohydrogen production in Enterobacter
      aerogenes.
PG  - 248
LID - 10.1186/s13068-017-0938-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Enterobacter aerogenes is a facultative anaerobe and is one of the
      most widely studied bacterial strains because of its ability to use a variety of 
      substrates, to produce hydrogen at a high rate, and its high growth rate during
      dark fermentation. However, the rate of hydrogen production has not been
      optimized. In this present study, three strategies to improve hydrogen production
      in E. aerogenes, namely the disruption of nuoCDE, overexpression of the small RNA
      RyhB and of NadE to regulate global anaerobic metabolism, and the redistribution 
      of metabolic flux. The goal of this study was to clarify the effect of nuoCDE,
      RyhB, and NadE on hydrogen production and how the perturbation of NADH influences
      the yield of hydrogen gas from E. aerogenes. RESULTS: NADH dehydrogenase activity
      was impaired by knocking out nuoCD or nuoCDE in E. aerogenes IAM1183 using the
      CRISPR-Cas9 system to explore the consequent effect on hydrogen production. The
      hydrogen yields from IAM1183-CD(nuoC/nuoD) and IAM1183-CDE (nuoC/nuoD/nuoE)
      increased, respectively, by 24.5 and 45.6% in batch culture (100 mL serum
      bottles). The hydrogen produced via the NADH pathway increased significantly in
      IAM1183-CDE, suggesting that nuoE plays an important role in regulating NADH
      concentration in E. aerogenes. Batch-cultivating experiments showed that by the
      overexpression of NadE (N), the hydrogen yields of IAM1183/N, IAM1183-CD/N, and
      IAM1183-CDE/N increased 1.06-, 1.35-, and 1.55-folds, respectively, compared with
      IAM1183. Particularly worth mentioning is that the strain IAM118-CDE/N reached
      2.28 mol in H2 yield, per mole of glucose consumed. IAN1183/R, IAM1183-CD/R, and 
      IAM1183-CDE/R showed increasing H2 yields in batch culture. Metabolic flux
      analysis indicated that increased expression of RyhB led to a significant shift
      in metabolic patterns. We further investigated IAM1183-CDE/N, which had the best 
      hydrogen-producing traits, as a potential candidate for industry applications
      using a 5-L fermenter; hydrogen production reached up to 1.95 times greater than 
      that measured for IAM1183. CONCLUSIONS: Knockout of nuoCD or nuoCDE and the
      overexpression of nadE in E. aerogenes resulted in a redistribution of metabolic 
      flux and improved the hydrogen yield. Overexpression of RyhB had an significant
      change on the hydrogen production via NADH pathway. A combination of strategies
      would be a novel approach for developing a more economic and efficient bioprocess
      for hydrogen production in E. aerogenes. Finally, the latest CRISPR-Cas9
      technology was successful for editing genes in E. aerogenes to develop our
      engineered strain for hydrogen production.

AB  - The objective of this work is to develop an integrated green process of
      subcritical water (SCW), enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation of coconut husk
      (CCH) to biohydrogen. The maximum sugar yield was obtained at mild severity
      factor. This was confirmed by the degradation of hemicellulose, cellulose and
      lignin. The tendency of the changing of sugar yield as a result of increasing
      severity factor was opposite to the tendency of pH change. It was found that CO2 
      gave a different tendency of severity factor compared to N2 as the pressurizing
      gas. The result of SEM analysis confirmed the structural changes during SCW
      pretreatment. This study integrated three steps all of which are green processes 
      which ensured an environmentally friendly process to produce a clean biohydrogen.

AB  - Biohydrogen production by the hyperthermophilic and halophilic bacterium T.
      maritima, using fruit and vegetable wastes as the carbon and energy sources was
      studied. Batch fermentation cultures showed that the use of a culture medium
      containing natural seawater and fruit and vegetable wastes can replace certain
      components (CaCl2, MgCl2, Balch's oligo-elements, yeast extract, KH2PO4 and
      K2HPO4) present in basal medium. However, a source of nitrogen and sulfur
      remained necessary for biohydrogen production. When fruit and vegetable waste
      collected from a wholesale market landfill was used, no decreases in total H2
      production (139 mmolL(-1)) or H2 yield (3.46 molmol(-1)) was observed.

TI  - Biotransformation of water lettuce (Pistia stratiotes) to biohydrogen by
      Rhodopseudomonas palustris.

AB  - AIMS: Aim of the paper was to assess the feasibility of producing hydrogen as a
      biofuel by photofermentation of fermented water lettuce (Pistia stratiotes L.)
      waste biomass, after a nitrogen-stripping treatment. METHODS AND RESULTS: A
      natural (42OL) and an engineered strain (CGA676, with low-ammonium sensitivity)
      of Rhodopseudomonas palustris were used for producing hydrogen. The stripping
      procedure was highly effective for ammonium removal, with an acceptable
      selectivity (91% of ammonium was removed; only 14% of total organic acids were
      lost). Both strains were able to produce hydrogen only in the nitrogen-stripped
      substrate. The natural strain R. palustris 42OL showed a higher Biochemical
      Hydrogen Potential (1224 ml l(-1) vs 720 ml l(-1) ; 50.0 mol m(-3) vs 29.4 mol
      m(-3) ), but at a lower rate (5.6 ml l(-1) h(-1) vs 7.3 ml l(-1) h(-1) ; 0.23 mol
      m(-3) h(-1) vs 0.29 mol m(-3) h(-1) ) than strain CGA676. CONCLUSIONS: Water
      lettuce waste biomass can be used for biofuel production, after hydrolization,
      fermentation and nitrogen stripping. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The
      investigation on novel, low cost and sustainable biomasses as feedstocks for
      biofuel production is a priority. Aquatic plants do not compete for arable land. 
      Moreover, water lettuce is a floating and invasive weed, thus its biomass must be
      harvested when detrimental, and can now be biotransformed in clean hydrogen.

AB  - This study aimed to better understand the role of different microbial groups and 
      the determining fermentation pathways in a biohydrogen (bioH2)-producing reactor 
      fed with sugarcane vinasse by using next-generation sequencing and principal
      component analysis (PCA). Both microbial structure and dynamics were
      characterized. The highest bioH2 production levels were associated with the
      Thermoanaerobacterium genus, whilst lactate-producing bacteria comprised the
      dominant genera (e.g. Lactobacillus and Leuconostoc) within the reactor at both
      stable and unstable bioH2-producing periods. PCA further revealed that the
      fermentation of lactate played a dual role in the reactor, as both
      bioH2-producing (acetate+lactate-->butyrate+bioH2) and non-bioH2-producing
      (lactate-->propionate+acetate) routes could be observed. Overall, the results
      suggested that lactate is the primary alternative carbon source in vinasse-fed
      systems subjected to carbohydrate-shortage conditions.

AB  - Short-term hydrothermal pretreatment (SHP) is an attractive method for food waste
      anaerobic digestion, which facilitates the solubilisation of recalcitrant
      particles. This study employed metaproteomic method to evaluate the relationships
      among microbial community phylogeny, function, and metabolic activity during
      two-stage anaerobic digestion under SHP (SHPT) from food waste. The presence of
      651 bacterial proteins and 477 archaeal protein has been detected by liquid
      chromatography online linked to mass spectrometry, revealing a high metabolic
      heterogeneity during SHPT. The different stages of SHPT highlighted important
      roles for the bacterial proteins from Gammaproteobacteria, Bacilli, and
      Clostridia and the archaeal proteins from Methanosarcinales. The identified
      proteins related to biohydrogen production come from pyruvic acid decarboxylase
      and formic acid decomposition pathway in carbohydrate metabolism and
      methanogenesis from acetate, CO2 and a methylotrophic pathway during energy
      metabolism. This could provide functional evidence of the metabolic activities
      and biogas production during SHPT.

AB  - This study investigated the effect of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) on
      high-rate continuous fermentative H2 production in a lab-scale fixed bed reactor 
      (FBR) inoculated with mixed culture granules and fed with 15g/L galactose at a
      hydraulic retention time of 6h and at 37 degrees C. During the 83days of
      operation, 5-HMF up to 2.4g/L was spiked into the feedstock. The maximum hydrogen
      production performance of 26.6L/L-d and 2.9mol H2/mol galactoseadded were
      achieved at 5-HMF concentration of 0.6g/L. 5-HMF concentration exceeding 0.9g/L
      not only inhibited hydrogen production but also affected the biofilm structure
      and microbial community population. However, when 5-HMF was eliminated from the
      feedstock, the performance and microbial community population were rapidly
      recovered.

AB  - A concept of biohythane production by combining biohydrogen and biomethane
      together via two-stage anaerobic fermentation (TSAF) has been recently proposed
      and considered as a promising approach for sustainable hythane generation from
      waste biomass. The advantage of biohythane over traditional biogas are more
      environmentally benign, higher energy recovery and shorter fermentation time.
      However, many of current efforts to convert waste biomass into biohythane are
      still at the bench scale. The system bioprocess study and scale up for industrial
      application are indispensable. This paper outlines the general approach of
      biohythane by comparing with other biological processes. The technical challenges
      are highlighted towards scale up of biohythane system, including
      functionalization of biohydrogen-producing reactor, energy efficiency, and
      bioprocess engineering of TSAF.

AB  - The formate pathway and NADH pathway as two common hydrogen-producing metabolic
      pathways have been well characterized to understand and improve biohydrogen
      production. These two pathways have been thought to be separate and have been
      independently investigated. However, in this study, perturbation of genes (hycA, 
      fdhF, fhlA, ldhA, nuoB, hybO, fdh1, narP, and ppk) in Enterobacter aerogenes
      related to the formate pathway or NADH pathway revealed that these two pathways
      affected each other. Further metabolic analysis suggested that a linear
      relationship existed between the relative change of hydrogen yield in the formate
      pathway or NADH pathway and the relative change of NADH yield or ATP yield. Thus,
      this finding provides new insight into the role of cellular reducing power and
      energy level in the hydrogen metabolism. It also establishes a rationale for
      improving hydrogen production from a global perspective.

AB  - Biological production of hydrogen is poised to become a significant player in the
      future energy mix. This review highlights recent advances and bottlenecks in
      various approaches to biohydrogen processes, often in concert with management of 
      organic wastes or waste CO2 . Some key bottlenecks are highlighted in terms of
      the overall energy balance of the process and highlighting the need for economic 
      and environmental life cycle analyses with regard also to socio-economic and
      geographical issues.

AB  - Production of biohydrogen and related metabolic by-products was investigated in
      Solid State Dark Fermentation (SSDF) of food waste (FW) and wheat straw (WS). The
      effect of the total solids (TS) content and H2 partial pressure (ppH2), two of
      the main operating factors of SSDF, were investigated. Batch tests with FW at 10,
      15, 20, 25 and 30% TS showed considerable effects of the TS on metabolites
      distribution. H2 production was strongly inhibited for TS contents higher than
      15% with a concomitant accumulation of lactic acid and a decrease in substrate
      conversion. Varying the ppH2 had no significant effect on the conversion products
      and overall degradation of FW and WS, suggesting that ppH2 was not the main
      limiting factor in SSDF. This study showed that the conversion of complex
      substrates by SSDF depends on the substrate type and is limited by the TS
      content.

AB  - The low C/N ratio and low carbohydrate content of sewage sludge limit its
      application for fermentative hydrogen production. In this study, perennial
      ryegrass was added as the co-substrate into sludge hydrogen fermentation with
      different mixing ratios for enhancing hydrogen production. The results showed
      that the highest hydrogen yield of 60mL/g-volatile solids (VS)added was achieved 
      when sludge/perennial ryegrass ratio was 30:70, which was 5 times higher than
      that from sole sludge. The highest VS removal of 21.8% was also achieved when
      sludge/perennial ryegrass ratio was 30:70, whereas VS removal from sole sludge
      was only 0.7%. Meanwhile, the co-fermentation system simultaneously improved
      hydrogen production efficiency and organics utilization of ryegrass. Kinetic
      analysis showed that the Cone model fitted hydrogen evolution better than the
      modified Gompertz model. Furthermore, hydrogen yield and VS removal increased
      with the increase of dehydrogenase activity.

TI  - Insights into Butyrate Production in a Controlled Fermentation System via Gene
      Predictions.
LID - e00051-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/mSystems.00051-17 [doi]
AB  - Butyrate is a common fatty acid produced in important fermentative systems, such 
      as the human/animal gut and other H2 production systems. Despite its importance, 
      there is little information on the partnerships between butyrate producers and
      other bacteria. The objective of this work was to uncover butyrate-producing
      microbial communities and possible metabolic routes in a controlled fermentation 
      system aimed at butyrate production. The butyrogenic reactor was operated at 37
      degrees C and pH 5.5 with a hydraulic retention time of 31 h and a low hydrogen
      partial pressure (PH2). High-throughput sequencing and metagenome functional
      prediction from 16S rRNA data showed that butyrate production pathways and
      microbial communities were different during batch (closed) and continuous-mode
      operation. Lactobacillaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and Enterococcaceae were the most
      abundant phylotypes in the closed system without PH2 control, whereas
      Prevotellaceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Actinomycetaceae were the most abundant
      phylotypes under continuous operation at low PH2. Putative butyrate producers
      identified in our system were from Prevotellaceae, Clostridiaceae,
      Ruminococcaceae, and Lactobacillaceae. Metagenome prediction analysis suggests
      that nonbutyrogenic microorganisms influenced butyrate production by generating
      butyrate precursors such as acetate, lactate, and succinate. 16S rRNA gene
      analysis suggested that, in the reactor, a partnership between identified
      butyrogenic microorganisms and succinate (i.e., Actinomycetaceae), acetate (i.e.,
      Ruminococcaceae and Actinomycetaceae), and lactate producers (i.e.,
      Ruminococcaceae and Lactobacillaceae) took place under continuous-flow operation 
      at low PH2. IMPORTANCE This study demonstrates how bioinformatics tools, such as 
      metagenome functional prediction from 16S rRNA genes, can help understand
      biological systems and reveal microbial interactions in controlled systems (e.g.,
      bioreactors). Results obtained from controlled systems are easier to interpret
      than those from human/animal studies because observed changes may be specifically
      attributed to the design conditions imposed on the system. Bioinformatics
      analysis allowed us to identify potential butyrogenic phylotypes and associated
      butyrate metabolism pathways when we systematically varied the PH2 in a carefully
      controlled fermentation system. Our insights may be adapted to butyrate
      production studies in biohydrogen systems and gut models, since butyrate is a
      main product and a crucial fatty acid in human/animal colon health.

TI  - Single-stage photofermentative biohydrogen production from sugar beet molasses by
      different purple non-sulfur bacteria.
PG  - 1589-1601
LID - 10.1007/s00449-017-1815-x [doi]
AB  - Biohydrogen production via fermentative routes offers considerable advantages in 
      waste recycling and sustainable energy production. This can be realized by
      single-stage dark or photofermentative processes, or by a two-stage integrated
      process; the latter offering the higher production yields due to complete
      conversion of sugar substrates into H2 and CO2. However, problems arising from
      the integration of these two processes limit its scale-up and implementation.
      Hence, high efficiency one-step fermentative biohydrogen production processes
      from sugar-rich wastes are preferable. In this study, different strains of purple
      non-sulfur bacteria were investigated for their biohydrogen production capacity
      on pure sucrose and sugar beet molasses, and the feasibility of single-stage
      photofermentative biohydrogen production was evaluated. A single-stage
      photofermentation process was carried out using four different strains of purple 
      non-sulfur bacteria (Rhodobacter capsulatus DSM 1710, R. capsulatus YO3,
      Rhodobacter sphaeroides O.U.001, and Rhodopseudomonas palustris DSM 127) on
      different initial sucrose concentrations. The highest hydrogen yield obtained was
      10.5 mol H2/mol of sucrose and the maximum hydrogen productivity was 0.78 mmol/L 
      h by Rp. palustris on 5 mM sucrose. A hydrogen yield of 19 mol H2/mol sucrose,
      which represents 79% of theoretical yield, and a maximum hydrogen productivity of
      0.55 mmol/L h were obtained by Rp. palustris from sugar beet molasses. The yield 
      was comparable to those values obtained in two-stage processes. The present study
      demonstrates that single-stage photofermentation using purple non-sulfur bacteria
      on sucrose-based wastes is promising.

AB  - Among the various biological routes for H2 production, dark fermentation is
      considered the most practically applicable owing to its capability to degrade
      organic wastes and high H2 production rate. Food waste (FW) has high carbohydrate
      content and easily hydrolysable in nature, exhibiting higher H2 production
      potential than that of other organic wastes. In this review article, first, the
      current status of H2 production from FW by dark fermentation and the strategies
      applied for enhanced performance are briefly summarized. Then, the technical and 
      economic limitations of dark fermentation of FW are thoroughly discussed.
      Economic assessment revealed that the economic feasibility of H2 production from 
      FW by dark fermentation is questionable. Current efforts to further increase H2
      yield and waste removal efficiency are also introduced. Finally, future
      perspectives along with possible routes converting dark fermentation effluent to 
      valuable fuels and chemicals are discussed.

AB  - Environmental and climatic change issues, population explosion, rapid
      urbanisation, depletion of fossil reserves, need for energy security, huge waste 
      generation, etc. are some of the inherent issues associated with the fossil based
      linear economy which need greater attention. In this context, the world is
      gradually transforming from fossil-based economy to a sustainable circular
      bio-economy. The biogenic waste which is generated in enormous quanties in India 
      can be considered as potential feedstock for structuring the bio-based economy.
      This communication depicts the need for developing waste derived bioeconomy in
      the Indian perspective. Waste is now being perceived as a resource with value and
      believed to supplement petroleum feedstock to a great extent if properly
      utilized. The necessity to introduce waste as the core element for the future
      economic models which also allows sustainable development is discussed. The
      review also establishes drivers for the bioeconomy and structures the waste
      derived bioeconomy in a sustainable format to address the futuristic needs, scope
      and opportunities envisaged in the business and economic realm. The enabling
      technologies/processes that can be applied for biogenic wastes valorisation are
      elaborated. Circularizing the economy in a waste biorefinery model for the
      production of biobased products including bioenergy is discussed.

AB  - An identified cold-adaptive, organic solvents-tolerant alkaline alpha-amylase
      (HP664) from Catenovulum sp. strain X3 was heterologously expressed and
      characterized in E. coli, and it was further applied to starch saccharification
      for biohydrogen production. The recombinant HP664 belongs to a member of
      glycoside hydrolase family 13 (GH13), with a molecular weight of 69.6kDa without 
      signal peptides, and also shares a relatively low similarity (49%) to other
      reported amylases. Biochemical characterization demonstrated that the maximal
      enzymatic activity of HP664 was observed at 35 degrees C and pH 9.0. Most metal
      ions inhibited its activity; however, low polar organic solvents (e.g., benzene
      and n-hexane) could enhance the activity by 35-50%. Additionally, HP664 also
      exhibited the catalytic capability on various polysaccharides, including potato
      starch, amylopectin, dextrin and agar. In order to increase the bioavailability
      of starch for H2 production, HP664 was utilized to elevate fermentable
      oligosaccharide level, and the results revealed that the maximal hydrolytic
      percentage of starch was up to 44% with 12h of hydrolysis using 5.63U of HP664.
      Biohydrogen fermentation of the starch hydrolysate by Clostridium sp. strain G1
      yielded 297.7mL of H2 after 84h of fermentation, which is 3.73-fold higher than
      the control without enzymatic treatment of HP664.

AB  - This study evaluated the influence of the co-substrate proportions (0-60% of
      cardboard in dry basis) and the initial total solid contents (20-40%) on the
      batch fermentation performance. Maximum hydrogen yields were obtained when
      mono-fermenting food waste at high solids contents (89mlH2.gVS(-1)). The hydrogen
      yields were lower when increasing the proportions of cardboard. The lower
      hydrogen yields at higher proportions of cardboard were translated into higher
      yields of caproic acid (up to 70.1gCOD.kgCODbio(-1)), produced by consumption of 
      acetic acid and hydrogen. The highest substrate conversions were achieved at low 
      proportions of cardboard, indicating a stabilization effect due to higher
      buffering capacities in co-fermentation. Clostridiales were predominant in all
      operational conditions. This study opens up new possibilities for using the
      cardboard proportions for controlling the production of high added-value products
      in dry co-fermentation of food waste.

AB  - (Red, green and brown) macroalgal biomass is a propitious candidate towards
      covenant alternative energy resources to be converted into biofuels i.e.
      hydrogen. The application of macroalgae for hydrogen fermentation (promising
      route in advancing the biohydrogen generation process) could be accomplished by
      the transformation of carbohydrates, which is a topic receiving broad attention
      in recent years. This article overviews the variety of marine algal biomass
      available in the coastal system, followed by the analyses of their pretreatment
      methods, inhibitor formation and possible detoxification, which are key-aspects
      to achieve subsequent H2 fermentation in a proper way.

AB  - The cultivation of mushrooms generates large amounts of waste polypropylene bags 
      stuffed with wood flour and bacterial nutrients that makes the mushroom waste
      (MW) a potential feedstock for anaerobic bioH2 fermentation. MW indigenous
      bacteria were enriched using thermophilic temperature (55 degrees C) for use as
      the seed inoculum without any external seeding. The peak hydrogen production rate
      (6.84 mmol H2/L-d) was obtained with cultivation pH 8 and substrate concentration
      of 60 g MW/L in batch fermentation. Hydrogen production yield (HY) is pH and
      substrate concentration dependent with an HY decline occurring at pH and
      substrate concentration increasing from pH 8 to 10 and 60 to 80 g MW/L,
      respectively. The fermentation bioH2 production from MW is in an acetate-type
      metabolic path.

AB  - Application of pre-aeration (AS) to waste prior to feeding was evaluated on
      acidogenic process in a semi-pilot scale biosystem for the production of biobased
      products (biohydrogen, volatile fatty acids (VFA) and biohythane) from food
      waste. Oxygen assisted in pre-hydrolysis of waste along with the suppression of
      methanogenic activity resulting in enhanced acidogenic product formation. AS
      operation resulted in 97% improvement in hydrogen conversion efficiency (HCE) and
      10% more VFA production than the control. Increasing the organic load (OL) of
      food waste in association with AS application improved the productivity. The
      application of AS also influenced concentration and composition of fatty acid.
      Highest fraction of acetic (5.3g/l), butyric (0.7g/l) and propionic acid
      (0.84g/l) was achieved at higher OL (100g COD/l) with good degree of
      acidification (DOA). AS strategy showed positive influence on biofuel
      (biohydrogen and biohythane) production along with the biosynthesis of short
      chain fatty acids functioning as a low-cost pretreatment strategy in a single
      stage bioprocess.

AB  - Nowadays, marine biomass is gradually considered as another utilizable material
      for the sustainable bioenergy development. In the present study, galactose, the
      main component of agar polysaccharide, was utilized for the biohydrogen
      production by Enterobacter sp. CN1. The highest hydrogen yield of 303.2mL/g was
      obtained in the cultivation media containing 5.87g/L of galactose, together with 
      initial pH of 7.3 and incubation temperature of 36 degrees C, after the response 
      surface methodology (RSM) analysis. After the saccharification process by the
      agarase (AgaXa) and neoagarobiose hydrolase (NH852), the agar hydrolysate
      obtained was further applied to generate biohydrogen by strain CN1. Under the
      synergistic enzymatic saccharification and fermentation process, the production
      of biohydrogen was obtained to be 5047+/-228mL/L from 50g/L of agar, resulting in
      3.86-fold higher than the control without enzymatic pretreatment.

AB  - This study examined the mesophilic continuous biohydrogen fermentation from
      galactose and glucose mixture with an initial substrate concentration of 15 g/L
      (galactose 12 g/L and glucose 3 g/L) as a resembling carbon source of pretreated 
      red algal hydrolyzate. A fixed bed reactor was fed with the sugar mixture at
      various hydraulic retention times (HRTs) ranging 12 to 1.5 h. The maximum
      hydrogen production rate of 52.6 L/L-d was found at 2 h HRT, while the maximum
      hydrogen yield of 2.3+/-0.1 mol/mol hexoseadded, was achieved at 3 h HRT.
      Microbial communities and species distribution were analyzed via quantitative
      polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and the dominant bacterial population was found 
      as Clostridia followed by Lactobacillus sp. Packing material retained higher 16S 
      rRNA gene copy numbers of total bacteria and Clostridium butyricum fraction
      compared to fermentation liquor. The finding of the study has demonstrated that
      H2 production from galactose and glucose mixture could be a viable approach for
      hydrogen production.

AB  - In this study, a biorefinery process integrating dark fermentation with
      microalgae cultivation (dual phase metabolic transition) was demonstrated with
      real-field wastewater. Acid rich fermented effluents (distillery waste (FDW1);
      dairy waste (FDW2)) were used as feedstock for microalgae cultivation.
      Experiments were performed with FDW1 during growth phase (GP) in mixotrophic mode
      and FDW2 during stress phase (SP) in both mixotrophic and heterotrophic modes.
      Mixotrophic cultivation with FDW1 documented significantly higher biomass
      productivity (5.3g/l). Total lipid (TL) percentage was high in mixotrophic (34%) 
      mode and neutral lipid (NL) was high in heterotrophic (13%) mode of cultivation
      during SP with FDW2. Overall, the microalgae growth is favoured with effluents
      containing high acetate, and low butyrate concentrations. Mixotrophic cultivation
      enhanced both biomass growth and lipid production along with simultaneous
      treatment.

AB  - In the present work, production of hydrogen via dark fermentation has been
      carried out using the hydrolyzed rice straw and Clostridium pasteurianum
      (MTCC116). The hydrolysis reaction of 1.0% alkali pretreated rice straw was
      performed at 70 degrees C and 10% substrate loading via Fe3O4/Alginate
      nanocomposite (Fe3O4/Alginate NCs) treated thermostable crude cellulase enzyme
      following the previously established method. It is noticed that under the
      optimized conditions, at 70 degrees C the Fe3O4/Alginate NCs treated cellulase
      has produced around 54.18g/L sugars as the rice straw hydrolyzate. Moreover, the 
      efficiency of the process illustrates that using this hydrolyzate, Clostridium
      pasteurianum (MTCC116) could produce cumulative hydrogen of 2580ml/L in 144h with
      the maximum production rate of 23.96ml/L/h in 96h. In addition, maximum dry
      bacterial biomass of 1.02g/L and 1.51g/L was recorded after 96h and 144h,
      respectively with corresponding initial pH of 6.6 and 3.8, suggesting higher
      hydrogen production.

TI  - Integrated systems for biopolymers and bioenergy production from organic waste
      and by-products: a review of microbial processes.
PG  - 113
LID - 10.1186/s13068-017-0802-4 [doi]
AB  - Recently, issues concerning the sustainable and harmless disposal of organic
      solid waste have generated interest in microbial biotechnologies aimed at
      converting waste materials into bioenergy and biomaterials, thus contributing to 
      a reduction in economic dependence on fossil fuels. To valorize biomass, waste
      materials derived from agriculture, food processing factories, and municipal
      organic waste can be used to produce biopolymers, such as biohydrogen and biogas,
      through different microbial processes. In fact, different bacterial strains can
      synthesize biopolymers to convert waste materials into valuable intracellular
      (e.g., polyhydroxyalkanoates) and extracellular (e.g., exopolysaccharides)
      bioproducts, which are useful for biochemical production. In particular, large
      numbers of bacteria, including Alcaligenes eutrophus, Alcaligenes latus,
      Azotobacter vinelandii, Azotobacter chroococcum, Azotobacter beijerincki,
      methylotrophs, Pseudomonas spp., Bacillus spp., Rhizobium spp., Nocardia spp.,
      and recombinant Escherichia coli, have been successfully used to produce
      polyhydroxyalkanoates on an industrial scale from different types of organic
      by-products. Therefore, the development of high-performance microbial strains and
      the use of by-products and waste as substrates could reasonably make the
      production costs of biodegradable polymers comparable to those required by
      petrochemical-derived plastics and promote their use. Many studies have reported 
      use of the same organic substrates as alternative energy sources to produce
      biogas and biohydrogen through anaerobic digestion as well as dark and
      photofermentation processes under anaerobic conditions. Therefore, concurrently
      obtaining bioenergy and biopolymers at a reasonable cost through an integrated
      system is becoming feasible using by-products and waste as organic carbon
      sources. An overview of the suitable substrates and microbial strains used in
      low-cost polyhydroxyalkanoates for biohydrogen and biogas production is given.
      The possibility of creating a unique integrated system is discussed because it
      represents a new approach for simultaneously producing energy and biopolymers for
      the plastic industry using by-products and waste as organic carbon sources.

TI  - Direct hydrogen production from dilute-acid pretreated sugarcane bagasse
      hydrolysate using the newly isolated Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum 
      MJ1.
PG  - 77
LID - 10.1186/s12934-017-0692-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Energy shortage and environmental pollution are two severe global
      problems, and biological hydrogen production from lignocellulose shows great
      potential as a promising alternative biofuel to replace the fossil fuels.
      Currently, most studies on hydrogen production from lignocellulose concentrate on
      cellulolytic microbe, pretreatment method, process optimization and development
      of new raw materials. Due to no effective approaches to relieve the inhibiting
      effect of inhibitors, the acid pretreated lignocellulose hydrolysate was directly
      discarded and caused environmental problems, suggesting that isolation of
      inhibitor-tolerant strains may facilitate the utilization of acid pretreated
      lignocellulose hydrolysate. RESULTS: Thermophilic bacteria for producing hydrogen
      from various kinds of sugars were screened, and the new strain named MJ1 was
      isolated from paper sludge, with 99% identity to Thermoanaerobacterium
      thermosaccharolyticum by 16S rRNA gene analysis. The hydrogen yields of 11.18,
      4.25 and 2.15 mol-H2/mol sugar can be reached at an initial concentration of 5
      g/L cellobiose, glucose and xylose, respectively. The main metabolites were
      acetate and butyrate. More important, MJ1 had an excellent tolerance to
      inhibitors of dilute-acid (1%, g/v) pretreated sugarcane bagasse hydrolysate
      (DAPSBH) and could efficiently utilize DAPSBH for hydrogen production without
      detoxication, with a production higher than that of pure sugars. The hydrogen
      could be quickly produced with the maximum hydrogen production reached at 24 h.
      The hydrogen production reached 39.64, 105.42, 111.75 and 110.44 mM at 20, 40, 60
      and 80% of DAPSBH, respectively. Supplementation of CaCO3 enhanced the hydrogen
      production by 21.32% versus the control. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate
      that MJ1 could directly utilize DAPSBH for biohydrogen production without
      detoxication and can serve as an excellent candidate for industrialization of
      hydrogen production from DAPSBH. The results also suggest that isolating unique
      strains from a particular environment offers an ideal way to conquer the related 
      problems.

AB  - Biohythane is a two-stage anaerobic fermentation process consisting of
      biohydrogen production followed by biomethanation. This serves as an environment 
      friendly and economically sustainable approach for the improved valorization of
      organic wastes. The characteristics of organic wastes depend on their respective 
      sources. The choice of an appropriate combination of complementary organic wastes
      can vastly improve the bioenergy generation besides achieving the significant
      cost reduction. The present study assess the suitability and economic viability
      of using the groundnut deoiled cake (GDOC), mustard deoiled cake (MDOC),
      distillers' dried grain with solubles (DDGS) and algal biomass (AB) as a
      co-substrate for the biohythane process. Results showed that maximum gaseous
      energy of 23.93, 16.63, 23.44 and 16.21kcal/L were produced using GDOC, MDOC,
      DDGS and AB in the two stage biohythane production, respectively. Both GDOC and
      DDGS were found to be better co-substrates as compared to MDOC and AB. The
      maximum cumulative hydrogen and methane production of 150 and 64mmol/L were
      achieved using GDOC. 98% reduction in substrate input cost (SIC) was achieved
      using the co-supplementation procedure.

AB  - The present study has attempted to get insight into ultrasound induced
      enhancement in biohydrogen production from glycerol fermentation using metabolic 
      flux analysis (MFA). A pseudo steady state metabolic flux network model was
      constructed and analyzed using experimentally measured glycerol uptake rate and
      fluxes of four metabolites, viz. acetate, butyrate, succinate and 1,3-PDO.
      Glycerol consumption increased by approximately 50% under sonication. Biohydrogen
      yield showed marked rise of approximately 40% with application of ultrasound.
      Butyrate and 1,3-PDO were the major products of glycerol metabolism. Sonication
      had major influence on carbon fluxes at the acetyl-CoA node. MFA results revealed
      enhanced flux towards butyrate under sonication, which was manifested in higher
      butyrate to acetate (B/A) ratio in products and greater H2 generation.
      Biohydrogen production was also a microbial growth associated process. Finally,
      two theoretical alternatives for further enhancement of biohydrogen production
      were assessed with MFA, viz. enhancement of glycerol uptake and blocking of
      butyrate pathway.

AB  - The effect of selectively enriched inoculum for biohydrogen production and shifts
      in microbial communities was observed using anaerobic sequencing batch reactor
      (AnSBR). Significantly, combined pretreatment using acid and iodopropane resulted
      3 fold increase in H2 production (8.65mol/kgCODR) over untreated control
      (2.63mol/kgCODR). Pretreatment showed significant shifts in the microbial
      communities which are thus accounted for enhanced H2 production. The
      high-throughput pyrosequence analysis depicted shifts in phylum Firmicutes and
      Proteobacteria. In the case of Proteobacteria, there was an increase in
      Betaproteobacterial, decrease in Epsilonproteobacterial and compositional
      variation in Alphaproteobacterial species. The decreased OTU number after
      pretreatment indicate, reduction of undesirable microbial populations while
      favouring conditions for microbiome that are involved in acidogenic, acetogenic
      and H2 production.

TI  - Reusing colored industrial wastewaters in a photofermentation for enhancing
      biohydrogen production by using ultrasound stimulated Rhodobacter sphaeroides.
PG  - 15870-15881
LID - 10.1007/s11356-017-8807-x [doi]
AB  - One-time ultrasonication pre-treatment of Rhodobacter sphaeroides was evaluated
      for improving biohydrogen production via photofermentation. Batch experiments
      were performed by varying ultrasonication amplitude (15, 30, and 45%) and
      duration (5, 10, and 15 min) using combined effluents from palm oil as well as
      pulp and paper mill as a single substrate. Experimental data showed that
      ultrasonication at amplitude 30% for 10 min (256.33 J/mL) achieved the highest
      biohydrogen yield of 9.982 mL H2/mLmedium with 5.125% of light efficiency. A
      maximum CODtotal removal of 44.7% was also obtained. However, when higher
      ultrasonication energy inputs (>256.33 J/mL) were transmitted to the cells,
      biohydrogen production did not improve further. In fact, 20.6% decrease of
      biohydrogen yield (as compared to the highest biohydrogen yield) was observed
      using the most intense ultrasonicated inoculum (472.59 J/mL). Field emission
      scanning electron microscope images revealed the occurrence of cell damages and
      biomass losses if ultrasonication at 472.59 J/mL was used. The present results
      suggested that moderate ultrasonication pre-treatment was an effective technique 
      to improve biohydrogen production performances of R. sphaeroides.

AB  - Energy supply, climate change, and global food security are among the main
      chalenges facing humanity in the twenty-first century. Despite global energy
      demand is continuing to increase, the availability of low cost energy is
      decreasing. Together with the urgent problem of climate change due to CO2 release
      from the combustion of fossil fuels, there is a strong requirement of developing 
      the clean and renewable energy system for the hydrogen production. Solar fuel,
      biofuel, and hydrogen energy production gained unlimited possibility and
      feasibility due to understanding of the detailed photosynthetic system
      structures. This special issue contains selected papers on photosynthetic and
      biomimetic hydrogen production presented at the International Conference
      "Photosynthesis Research for Sustainability-2016", that was held in Pushchino
      (Russia), during June 19-25, 2016, with the sponsorship of the International
      Society of Photosynthesis Research (ISPR) and of the International Association
      for Hydrogen Energy (IAHE). This issue is intended to provide recent information 
      on the photosynthetic and biohydrogen production to our readers.

TI  - Microbial cell immobilization in biohydrogen production: a short overview.
PG  - 157-171
LID - 10.1080/07388551.2017.1312274 [doi]
AB  - The high dependence on fossil fuels has escalated the challenges of greenhouse
      gas emissions and energy security. Biohydrogen is projected as a future
      alternative energy as a result of its non-polluting characteristics, high energy 
      content (122 kJ/g), and economic feasibility. However, its industrial production 
      has been hampered by several constraints such as low process yields and the
      formation of biohydrogen-competing reactions. This necessitates the search for
      other novel strategies to overcome this problem. Cell immobilization technology
      has been in existence for many decades and is widely used in various processes
      such as wastewater treatment, food technology, and pharmaceutical industry. In
      recent years, this technology has caught the attention of many researchers within
      the biohydrogen production field owing to its merits such as enhanced process
      yields, reduced microbial contamination, and improved homogeneity. In addition,
      the use of immobilization in biohydrogen production prevents washout of microbes,
      stabilizes the pH of the medium, and extends microbial activity during continuous
      processes. In this short review, an insight into the potential of cell
      immobilization is presented. A few immobilization techniques such as entrapment, 
      adsorption, encapsulation, and synthetic polymers are discussed. In addition, the
      effects of process conditions on the performance of immobilized microbial cells
      during biohydrogen production are discussed. Finally, the review concludes with
      suggestions on improvement of cell immobilization technologies in biohydrogen
      production.

TI  - Microbial ecology of fermentative hydrogen producing bioprocesses: useful
      insights for driving the ecosystem function.
PG  - 158-181
LID - 10.1093/femsre/fuw043 [doi]
AB  - One of the most important biotechnological challenges is to develop environment
      friendly technologies to produce new sources of energy. Microbial production of
      biohydrogen through dark fermentation, by conversion of residual biomass, is an
      attractive solution for short-term development of bioH2 producing processes.
      Efficient biohydrogen production relies on complex mixed communities working in
      tight interaction. Species composition and functional traits are of crucial
      importance to maintain the ecosystem service. The analysis of microbial community
      revealed a wide phylogenetic diversity that contributes in different-and still
      mostly unclear-ways to hydrogen production. Bridging this gap of knowledge
      between microbial ecology features and ecosystem functionality is essential to
      optimize the bioprocess and develop strategies toward a maximization of the
      efficiency and stability of substrate conversion. The aim of this review is to
      provide a comprehensive overview of the most up-to-date biodata available and
      discuss the main microbial community features of biohydrogen engineered
      ecosystems, with a special emphasis on the crucial role of interactions and the
      relationships between species composition and ecosystem service. The elucidation 
      of intricate relationships between community structure and ecosystem function
      would make possible to drive ecosystems toward an improved functionality on the
      basis of microbial ecology principles.

TI  - Co-production of hydrogen and ethanol from glucose in Escherichia coli by
      activation of pentose-phosphate pathway through deletion of phosphoglucose
      isomerase (pgi) and overexpression of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (zwf) and
      6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (gnd).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Biologically, hydrogen (H2) can be produced through dark fermentation
      and photofermentation. Dark fermentation is fast in rate and simple in reactor
      design, but H2 production yield is unsatisfactorily low as <4 mol H2/mol glucose.
      To address this challenge, simultaneous production of H2 and ethanol has been
      suggested. Co-production of ethanol and H2 requires enhanced formation of NAD(P)H
      during catabolism of glucose, which can be accomplished by diversion of
      glycolytic flux from the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) pathway to the
      pentose-phosphate (PP) pathway in Escherichia coli. However, the disruption of
      pgi (phosphoglucose isomerase) for complete diversion of carbon flux to the PP
      pathway made E. coli unable to grow on glucose under anaerobic condition.
      RESULTS: Here, we demonstrate that, when glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Zwf) 
      and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (Gnd), two major enzymes of the PP pathway, 
      are homologously overexpressed, E. coli Deltapgi can recover its anaerobic growth
      capability on glucose. Further, with additional deletions of DeltahycA,
      DeltahyaAB, DeltahybBC, DeltaldhA, and DeltafrdAB, the recombinant Deltapgi
      mutant could produce 1.69 mol H2 and 1.50 mol ethanol from 1 mol glucose.
      However, acetate was produced at 0.18 mol mol(-1) glucose, indicating that some
      carbon is metabolized through the Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway. To further
      improve the flux via the PP pathway, heterologous zwf and gnd from Leuconostoc
      mesenteroides and Gluconobacter oxydans, respectively, which are less inhibited
      by NADPH, were overexpressed. The new recombinant produced more ethanol at 1.62
      mol mol(-1) glucose along with 1.74 mol H2 mol(-1) glucose, which are close to
      the theoretically maximal yields, 1.67 mol mol(-1) each for ethanol and H2.
      However, the attempt to delete the ED pathway in the Deltapgi mutant to operate
      the PP pathway as the sole glycolytic route, was unsuccessful. CONCLUSIONS: By
      deletion of pgi and overexpression of heterologous zwf and gnd in E. coli
      DeltahycA DeltahyaAB DeltahybBC DeltaldhA DeltafrdAB, two important biofuels,
      ethanol and H2, could be successfully co-produced at high yields close to their
      theoretical maximums. The strains developed in this study should be applicable
      for the production of other biofuels and biochemicals, which requires supply of
      excessive reducing power under anaerobic conditions.

TI  - Hydrogen Production by a Chlamydomonas reinhardtii Strain with Inducible
      Expression of Photosystem II.
LID - E647 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms18030647 [doi]
AB  - Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cy6Nac2.49 is a genetically modified algal strain that 
      activates photosynthesis in a cyclical manner, so that photosynthesis is not
      active constitutively in the presence of oxygen, but is turned on only in
      response to a metabolic trigger (anaerobiosis). Here, we further investigated
      hydrogen production by this strain comparing it with the parental wild-type
      strain under photoheterotrophic conditions in regular tris-acetate-phosphate
      (TAP) medium with a 10-h:14-h light/dark regime. Unlike the wild-type, whose
      level of H(2) production remained low during illumination, H(2) production in the
      mutant strain increased gradually with each subsequent light period, and by the
      final light period was significantly higher than the wild-type. The relatively
      low Photosystem II (PSII) activity of the mutant culture was shown by low
      fluorescence yield both in the dark (Fv/Fm) and in the light (deltaF/Fm')
      periods. Measurement of oxygen evolution confirmed the low photosynthetic
      activity of the mutant cells, which gradually accumulated O(2) to a lesser extent
      than the wild-type, thus allowing the mutant strain to maintain hydrogenase
      activity over a longer time period and to gradually accumulate H(2) during
      periods of illumination. Therefore, controllable expression of PSII can be used
      to increase hydrogen production under nutrient replete conditions, thus avoiding 
      many of the limitations associated with nutrient deprivation approaches sometimes
      used to promote hydrogen production.

TI  - Simultaneous Decolorization and Biohydrogen Production from Xylose by Klebsiella 
      oxytoca GS-4-08 in the Presence of Azo Dyes with Sulfonate and Carboxyl Groups.
LID - e00508-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/AEM.00508-17 [doi]
AB  - Biohydrogen production from the pulp and paper effluent containing rich
      lignocellulosic material could be achieved by the fermentation process. Xylose,
      an important hemicellulose hydrolysis product, is used less efficiently as a
      substrate for biohydrogen production. Moreover, azo dyes are usually added to
      fabricate anticounterfeiting paper, which further increases the complexity of
      wastewater. This study reports that xylose could serve as the sole carbon source 
      for a pure culture of Klebsiella oxytoca GS-4-08 to achieve simultaneous
      decolorization and biohydrogen production. With 2 g liter(-1) of xylose as the
      substrate, a maximum xylose utilization rate (URxyl) and a hydrogen molar yield
      (HMY) of 93.99% and 0.259 mol of H2 mol of xylose(-1), respectively, were
      obtained. Biohydrogen kinetics and electron equivalent (e(-) equiv) balance
      calculations indicated that methyl red (MR) penetrates and intracellularly
      inhibits both the pentose phosphate pathway and pyruvate fermentation pathway,
      while methyl orange (MO) acted independently of the glycolysis and biohydrogen
      pathway. The data demonstrate that biohydrogen pathways in the presence of azo
      dyes with sulfonate and carboxyl groups were different, but the azo dyes could be
      completely reduced during the biohydrogen production period in the presence of MO
      or MR. The feasibility of hydrogen production from industrial pulp and paper
      effluent by the strain if the xylose is sufficient was also proved and was not
      affected by toxic substances which usually exist in such wastewater, except for
      chlorophenol. This study offers a promising energy-recycling strategy for
      treating pulp and paper wastewaters, especially for those containing azo
      dyes.IMPORTANCE The pulp and paper industry is a major industry in many
      developing countries, and the global market of pulp and paper wastewater
      treatment is expected to increase by 60% between 2012 and 2020. Such wastewater
      contains large amounts of refractory contaminants, such as lignin, whose
      reclamation is considered economically crucial and environmentally friendly.
      Furthermore, azo dyes are usually added in order to fabricate anticounterfeiting 
      paper, which further increases the complexity of the pulp and paper wastewater.
      This work may offer a better understanding of biohydrogen production from xylose 
      in the presence of azo dyes and provide a promising energy-recycling method for
      treating pulp and paper wastewater, especially for those containing azo dyes.

AB  - The increasing food waste production calls for developing efficient technologies 
      for its treatment. Anaerobic processes provide an effective waste valorization.
      The influence of the initial substrate load on the performance of batch dry
      anaerobic co-digestion reactors treating food waste and cardboard was
      investigated. The load was varied by modifying the substrate to inoculum ratio
      (S/X), the total solids content and the co-digestion proportions. The results
      showed that the S/X was a crucial parameter. Within the tested values (0.25, 1
      and 4gVS.gVS(-1)), only the reactors working at 0.25 produced methane.
      Methanosarcina was the main archaea, indicating its importance for efficient
      methanogenesis. Acidogenic fermentation was predominant at higher S/X, producing 
      hydrogen and other metabolites. Higher substrate conversions (</=48%) and
      hydrogen yields (</=62mL.gVS(-1)) were achieved at low loads. This study suggests
      that different value-added compounds can be produced in dry conditions, with the 
      initial substrate load as easy-to-control operational parameter.

TI  - Effect of adding brewery wastewater to pulp and paper mill effluent to enhance
      the photofermentation process: wastewater characteristics, biohydrogen
      production, overall performance, and kinetic modeling.

AB  - Although a significant amount of brewery wastewater (BW) is generated during beer
      production, the nutrients in the BW could be reused as a potential bio-resource
      for biohydrogen production. Therefore, improvements in photofermentative
      biohydrogen production due to a combination of BW and pulp and paper mill
      effluent (PPME) as a mixed production medium were investigated comprehensively in
      this study. The experimental results showed that both the biohydrogen yield and
      the chemical oxygen demand removal were improved through the combination of BW
      and PPME. The best biohydrogen yield of 0.69 mol H2/L medium was obtained using
      the combination of 10 % BW + 90 % PPME (10B90P), while the reuse of the
      wastewater alone (100 % BW and 100 % PPME) resulted in 42.3 and 44.0 % less
      biohydrogen yields than the highest yield, respectively. The greatest light
      efficiency was 1.97 % and was also achieved using the combination of both
      wastewaters at 10B90P. This study revealed the potential of reusing and combining
      two different effluents together, in which the combination of BW and PPME
      improved the nutrients and light penetration into the mixed production medium.

AB  - Two heat-treated inocula, fresh and digested activated sludge from the same
      municipal wastewater treatment plant, were compared for their H2 production via
      dark fermentation at mesophilic (37 degrees C), thermophilic (55 degrees C) and
      hyperthermophilic (70 degrees C) conditions using xylose as the substrate. At
      both 37 and 55 degrees C, the fresh activated sludge yielded more H2 than the
      digested sludge, whereas at 70 degrees C, neither of the inocula produced H2
      effectively. A maximum yield of 1.85 mol H2 per mol of xylose consumed was
      obtained at 55 degrees C. H2 production was linked to acetate and butyrate
      production, and there was a linear correlation (R(2) = 0.96) between the butyrate
      and H2 yield for the fresh activated sludge inoculum at 55 degrees C.
      Approximately 2.4 mol H2 per mol of butyrate produced were obtained against a
      theoretical maximum of 2.0, suggesting that H2 was produced via the acetate
      pathway prior to switching to the butyrate pathway due to the increased H2
      partial pressure. Clostridia sp. were the prevalent species at both 37 and 55
      degrees C, irrespectively of the inoculum type. Although the two inocula
      originated from the same plant, different thermophilic microorganisms were
      detected at 55 degrees C. Thermoanaerobacter sp., detected only in the fresh
      activated sludge cultures, may have contributed to the high H2 yield obtained
      with such an inoculum.

TI  - Characterization of Frex as an NADH sensor for in vivo applications in the
      presence of NAD(+) and at various pH values.
PG  - 305-315
LID - 10.1007/s11120-017-0348-0 [doi]
AB  - The fluorescent biosensor Frex, recently introduced as a sensitive tool to
      quantify the NADH concentration in living cells, was characterized by
      time-integrated and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy regarding its
      applicability for in vivo measurements. Based on the purified sensor protein, it 
      is shown that the NADH dependence of Frex fluorescence can be described by a Hill
      function with a concentration of half-maximal sensor response of K D
      approximately 4 microM and a Hill coefficient of n approximately 2. Increasing
      concentrations of NADH have moderate effects on the fluorescence lifetime of
      Frex, which changes by a factor of two from about 500 ps in the absence of NADH
      to 1 ns under fluorescence-saturating NADH concentrations. Therefore, the
      observed sevenfold rise of the fluorescence intensity is primarily ascribed to
      amplitude changes. Notably, the dynamic range of Frex sensitivity towards NADH
      highly depends on the NAD(+) concentration, while the apparent K D for NADH is
      only slightly affected. We found that NAD(+) has a strong inhibitory effect on
      the fluorescence response of Frex during NADH sensing, with an apparent NAD(+)
      dissociation constant of K I approximately 400 microM. This finding was supported
      by fluorescence lifetime measurements, which showed that the addition of NAD(+)
      hardly affects the fluorescence lifetime, but rather reduces the number of Frex
      molecules that are able to bind NADH. Furthermore, the fluorescence responses of 
      Frex to NADH and NAD(+) depend critically on pH and temperature. Thus, for in
      vivo applications of Frex, temperature and pH need to be strictly controlled or
      considered during data acquisition and analysis. If all these constraints are
      properly met, Frex fluorescence intensity measurements can be employed to
      estimate the minimum NADH concentration present within the cell at sufficiently
      low NAD(+) concentrations below 100 microM.

TI  - Microbial fuel cell coupled to biohydrogen reactor: a feasible technology to
      increase energy yield from cheese whey.
PG  - 807-819
LID - 10.1007/s00449-017-1746-6 [doi]
AB  - An important pollutant produced during the cheese making process is cheese whey
      which is a liquid by-product with high content of organic matter, composed mainly
      by lactose and proteins. Hydrogen can be produced from cheese whey by dark
      fermentation but, organic matter is not completely removed producing an effluent 
      rich in volatile fatty acids. Here we demonstrate that this effluent can be
      further used to produce energy in microbial fuel cells. Moreover, current
      production was not feasible when using raw cheese whey directly to feed the
      microbial fuel cell. A maximal power density of 439 mW/m(2) was obtained from the
      reactor effluent which was 1000 times more than when using raw cheese whey as
      substrate. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing showed that potential electroactive 
      populations (Geobacter, Pseudomonas and Thauera) were enriched on anodes of MFCs 
      fed with reactor effluent while fermentative populations (Clostridium and
      Lactobacillus) were predominant on the MFC anode fed directly with raw cheese
      whey. This result was further demonstrated using culture techniques. A total of
      45 strains were isolated belonging to 10 different genera including known
      electrogenic populations like Geobacter (in MFC with reactor effluent) and known 
      fermentative populations like Lactobacillus (in MFC with cheese whey). Our
      results show that microbial fuel cells are an attractive technology to gain extra
      energy from cheese whey as a second stage process during raw cheese whey
      treatment by dark fermentation process.

TI  - Biohydrogen production from sugarcane bagasse hydrolysate: effects of pH, S/X,

PG  - 8790-8804
LID - 10.1007/s11356-017-8560-1 [doi]
AB  - Batch dark fermentation experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of 
      initial pH, substrate-to-biomass (S/X) ratio, and concentrations of Fe(2+) and
      magnetite nanoparticles on biohydrogen production from sugarcane bagasse (SCB)
      hydrolysate. By applying the response surface methodology, the optimum condition 
      of steam-acid hydrolysis was 0.64% (v/v) H2SO4 for 55.7 min, which obtained a
      sugar yield of 274 mg g(-1). The maximum hydrogen yield (HY) of 0.874 mol (mol
      glucose(-1)) was detected at the optimum pH of 5.0 and S/X ratio of 0.5 g
      chemical oxygen demand (COD, g VSS(-1)). The addition of Fe(2+) 200 mg L(-1) and 
      magnetite nanoparticles 200 mg L(-1) to the inoculum enhanced the HY by 62.1% and
      69.6%, respectively. The kinetics of hydrogen production was estimated by fitting
      the experimental data to the modified Gompertz model. The inhibitory effects of
      adding Fe(2+) and magnetite nanoparticles to the fermentative hydrogen production
      were examined by applying Andrew's inhibition model. COD mass balance and full
      stoichiometric reactions, including soluble metabolic products, cell synthesis,
      and H2 production, indicated the reliability of the experimental results. A
      qPCR-based analysis was conducted to assess the microbial community structure
      using Enterobacteriaceae, Clostridium spp., and hydrogenase-specific gene
      activity. Results from the microbial analysis revealed the dominance of hydrogen 
      producers in the inoculum immobilized on magnetite nanoparticles, followed by the
      inoculum supplemented with Fe(2+) concentration. Graphical abstract .

TI  - A critical review on factors influencing fermentative hydrogen production.
PG  - 1195-1220
AB  - Biohydrogen production by dark fermentation of different waste materials is a
      promising approach to produce bio-energy in terms of renewable energy
      exploration. This communication has reviewed various influencing factors of dark 
      fermentation process with detailed account of determinants in biohydrogen
      production. It has also focused on different factors such as improved bacterial
      strain, reactor design, metabolic engineering and two stage processes to enhance 
      the bioenergy productivity from substrate. The study also suggest that complete
      utilization of substrates for biological hydrogen production requires the
      concentrated research and development for efficient functioning of microorganism 
      with integrated application for energy production and bioremediation. Various
      studies have been taken into account here, to show the comparative efficiency of 
      different substrates and operating conditions with inhibitory factors and
      pretreatment option for biohydrogen production. The study reveals that an
      extensive research is needed to observe field efficiency of process using low
      cost substrates and integration of dark and photo fermentation process.
      Integrated approach of fermentation process will surely compete with conventional
      hydrogen process and replace it completely in future.

AB  - In this study single-chamber microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) were applied to 
      treat cheese whey (CW), an industrial by-product, and recover H2 gas. Firstly,
      this substrate was fed directly to the MEC to get the initial feedback about its 
      H2 generation potential. The results indicated that the direct application of CW 
      requires an adequate pH control to realize bioelectrohydrogenesis and avoid
      operational failure due to the loss of bioanode activity. In the second part of
      the study, the effluents of anaerobic (methanogenic) digester and hydrogenogenic 
      (dark fermentative H2-producing) reactor utilizing the CW were tested in the MEC 
      process (representing the concept of a two-stage technology). It turned out that 
      the residue of the methanogenic reactor - with its relatively lower carbohydrate-
      and higher volatile fatty acid contents - was more suitable to produce hydrogen
      bioelectrochemically. The MEC operated with the dark fermentation effluent,
      containing a high portion of carbohydrates and low amount of organic acids,
      produced significant amount of undesired methane simultaneously with H2. Overall,
      the best MEC behavior was attained using the effluent of the methanogenic reactor
      and therefore, considering a two-stage system, methanogenesis is an advisable
      pretreatment step for the acidic CW to enhance the H2 formation in complementary 
      microbial electrohydrogenesis.

AB  - Limits in resource availability are driving a change in current societal
      production systems, changing the focus from residues treatment, such as
      wastewater treatment, toward resource recovery. Biotechnological processes offer 
      an economic and versatile way to concentrate and transform resources from
      waste/wastewater into valuable products, which is a prerequisite for the
      technological development of a cradle-to-cradle bio-based economy. This review
      identifies emerging technologies that enable resource recovery across the
      wastewater treatment cycle. As such, bioenergy in the form of biohydrogen (by
      photo and dark fermentation processes) and biogas (during anaerobic digestion
      processes) have been classic targets, whereby, direct transformation of lipidic
      biomass into biodiesel also gained attention. This concept is similar to previous
      biofuel concepts, but more sustainable, as third generation biofuels and other
      resources can be produced from waste biomass. The production of high value
      biopolymers (e.g., for bioplastics manufacturing) from organic acids, hydrogen,
      and methane is another option for carbon recovery. The recovery of carbon and
      nutrients can be achieved by organic fertilizer production, or single cell
      protein generation (depending on the source) which may be utilized as feed, feed 
      additives, next generation fertilizers, or even as probiotics. Additionlly,
      chemical oxidation-reduction and bioelectrochemical systems can recover
      inorganics or synthesize organic products beyond the natural microbial
      metabolism. Anticipating the next generation of wastewater treatment plants
      driven by biological recovery technologies, this review is focused on the
      generation and re-synthesis of energetic resources and key resources to be
      recycled as raw materials in a cradle-to-cradle economy concept.

AB  - Electrodialysis (ED) removed volatile fatty acids (VFAs) from a continually-fed, 
      hydrogen-producing fermenter. Simultaneously, electrochemical removal and
      adsorption removed gaseous H2 and CO2, respectively. Removing VFAs via ED in this
      novel process increased H2 yields by a factor of 3.75 from 0.24molH2mol(-1)hexose
      to 0.90molH2mol(-1)hexose. VFA production and substrate utilisation rates were
      consistent with the hypothesis that end product inhibition arrests H2 production.
      The methodology facilitated the recovery of 37g of VFAs, and 30L H2 that was more
      than 99% pure, both of which are valuable, energy dense chemicals. Typically,
      short hydraulic and solid retention times, and depressed pH levels are used to
      suppress methanogenesis, but this limits H2 production. To produce H2 from real
      world, low grade biomass containing complex carbohydrates, longer hydraulic
      retention times (HRTs) are required. The proposed system increased H2 yields via 
      increased substrate utilisation over longer HRTs.

AB  - This research assessed the viability to use disposable diapers as a substrate for
      the production of biohydrogen, a valuable clean-energy source. The important
      content of cellulose of disposable diapers indicates that this waste could be an 
      attractive substrate for biofuel production. Two incubation temperatures (35
      degrees C and 55 degrees C) and three diaper conditioning methods (whole diapers 
      with faeces, urine, and plastics, WD; diapers without plastic components, with
      urine and faeces, DWP; diapers with urine but without faeces and plastic, MSD)
      were tested in batch bioreactors. The bioreactors were operated in the solid
      substrate anaerobic hydrogenogenic fermentation with intermittent venting mode
      (SSAHF-IV). The batch reactors were loaded with the substrate at ca. 25% of total
      solids and 10% w/w inoculum. The average cumulative bioH2 production followed the
      order WD > MSD > DWP. The bio-H2 production using MSD was unexpectedly higher
      than DWP; the presence of plastics in the first was expected to be associated to 
      lower degradability and H2 yield. BioH2 production at 55 degrees C was superior
      to that of 35 degrees C, probably owing to a more rapid microbial metabolism in
      the thermophilic regime. The results of this work showed low yields in the
      production of H2 at both temperatures compared with those reported in the
      literature for municipal and agricultural organic waste. The studied process
      could improve the ability to dispose of this residue with H2 generation as the
      value-added product. Research is ongoing to increase the yield of biohydrogen
      production from waste disposable diapers.

AB  - One of the best options to alleviate the problems associated with global warming 
      and climate change is to reduce burning of fossil fuels and search for new
      alternative energy resources. In case of biodiesel and bioethanol production, the
      choice of feedstock and the process design influences the GHG emissions and
      appropriate methods need to be adapted. Hydrogen is a zero-carbon and energy
      dense alternative energy carrier with clean burning properties and biohydrogen
      production by microalgae can reduce production associated GHG emissions to a
      great extent. Biohydrogen can be produced through dark fermentation using sugars,
      starch, or cellulosic materials. Microalgae-based biohydrogen production is
      recently regarded as a promising pathway for biohydrogen production via
      photolysis or being a substrate for anaerobic fermentation. This review lists the
      methods of hydrogen production by microalgae. The enzymes involved and the

TI  - Distal [FeS]-Cluster Coordination in [NiFe]-Hydrogenase Facilitates
      Intermolecular Electron Transfer.
LID - E100 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms18010100 [doi]
AB  - Biohydrogen is a versatile energy carrier for the generation of electric energy
      from renewable sources. Hydrogenases can be used in enzymatic fuel cells to
      oxidize dihydrogen. The rate of electron transfer (ET) at the anodic side between
      the [NiFe]-hydrogenase enzyme distal iron-sulfur cluster and the electrode
      surface can be described by the Marcus equation. All parameters for the Marcus
      equation are accessible from Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. The
      distal cubane FeS-cluster has a three-cysteine and one-histidine coordination
      [Fe(4)S(4)](His)(Cys)(3) first ligation sphere. The reorganization energy (inner-
      and outer-sphere) is almost unchanged upon a histidine-to-cysteine substitution. 
      Differences in rates of electron transfer between the wild-type enzyme and an
      all-cysteine mutant can be rationalized by a diminished electronic coupling
      between the donor and acceptor molecules in the [Fe(4)S(4)](Cys)(4) case. The
      fast and efficient electron transfer from the distal iron-sulfur cluster is
      realized by a fine-tuned protein environment, which facilitates the flow of
      electrons. This study enables the design and control of electron transfer rates
      and pathways by protein engineering.

AB  - The aim of this work is to investigate the hydrogen and poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate
      (PHB) production during the photofermentative treatment of the effluent from a
      dark fermentation reactor fed with the organic fraction of municipal solid waste.
      Two different inocula, an adapted culture of Rhodobacter sphaeroides AV1b and a
      mixed consortium of purple non sulphur bacteria have been investigated under the 
      same operational conditions. Different hydrogen productivities of 364 and 559NmL 
      H2 L(-1) were observed for the Rhodobacter sphaeroides and the mixed culture
      consortium tests, respectively: the consortium of PNSB resulted 1.5-fold more
      productive than the pure culture. On the other hand, Rhodobacter sphaeroides
      culture showed a higher PHB productivity (155mg PHB g COD(-1)) than the mixed
      culture (55mg PHB g COD(-1)). In all the tests, the concomitant H2 and PHB
      production was associated to a dissolved COD removal higher than 80%.

AB  - In this paper, the anaerobic treatment of a high organic-strength wastewater-type
      feedstock, referred as the liquid fraction of pressed municipal solid waste (LPW)
      was studied for energy recovery and organic matter removal. The processes
      investigated were (i) dark fermentation to produce biohydrogen, (ii) anaerobic
      digestion for biogas formation and (iii) microbial fuel cells for electrical
      energy generation. To find a feasible alternative for LPW treatment (meeting the 
      two-fold aims given above), various one- as well as multi-stage processes were
      tested. The applications were evaluated based on their (i) COD removal
      efficiencies and (ii) specific energy gain. As a result, considering the former
      aspect, the single-stage processes could be ranked as: microbial fuel cell
      (92.4%)> anaerobic digestion (50.2%)> hydrogen fermentation (8.8%). From the
      latter standpoint, an order of hydrogen fermentation (2277 J g(-1) CODremoved
      d(-1))> anaerobic digestion (205 J g(-1) CODremoved d(-1))> microbial fuel cell
      (0.43 J g(-1) CODremoved d(-1)) was attained. The assessment showed that
      combined, multi-step treatment was necessary to simultaneously achieve efficient 
      organic matter removal and energy recovery from LPW. Therefore, a three-stage
      system (hydrogen fermentation-biomethanation-bioelectrochemical cell in sequence)
      was suggested. The different approaches were characterized via the estimation of 
      COD balance, as well.

AB  - Ethanol organosolv pretreated rice straw was used to produce biohydrogen using
      Enterobacter aerogenes. The effect of temperature (120-180 degrees C), residence 
      time (30-90min), and ethanol concentration (45-75%v/v) on the hydrogen yield,
      residual biomass, and lignin recovery was investigated using RSM. In contrast to 
      the residual solid and lignin recovery, no considerable trend could be observed
      for the changes in the hydrogen yield at different treatment severities. The
      maximum hydrogen yield of 19.73mlg(-1) straw was obtained at the ethanol
      concentration of 45%v/v and 180 degrees C for 30min. Furthermore, the potential
      amount of biohydrogen was estimated in the top ten rice producing nations using
      the experimental results. Approximately 355.8kt of hydrogen and 11.3Mt of lignin 
      could globally be produced. Based on a Monte Carlo analysis, the production of
      biohydrogen from rice straw has the lowest risk in China and the highest in
      Japan.

      microbial electrohydrogenesis cell (MEC) with optimized design characteristics,
      in particular cathode surface area and anode-cathode spacing using acetate as
      substrate. The results showed that the maximal H2 production rates and best
      energetic performances could be obtained using the smallest, 71 cm(2) stainless
      steel cathode and 4 cm electrode distances, employing a 60 cm(2) bioanode. Cyclic

AB  - Effects of the freeze-thaw process on physical properties, cell viability,
      microbial activities and population structures of anaerobic sludge were
      investigated. It was found that the sludge volume index was greatly reduced from 
      16.4 mL/g in the original sludge to 4.0 mL/g in the solid fraction of the
      frozen-thawed sludge. Even though the freeze-thaw process decreased cell
      viability in the solid fraction of the frozen-thawed sludge, microbial activity
      tests showed that the freeze-thaw process enhanced acidogenic activity
      approximately 20%. The enhanced acidogenic activity of the solid fraction was in 
      good agreement with the enrichment of Clostridiaceae, Porphyromonadaceae and
      Propionibacteriaceae found in the solid fraction. The relative abundances of
      Proteobacteria families Oxalobacteraceae, Moraxellaceae, and Pseudomonadaceae
      were found to be highest in the liquid fraction where they form a substantial
      proportion of the bacterial community (a total of 59%).

AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of hydraulic retention
      time (HRT) (8 to 0.5 h) and temperature (55 to 75 degrees C) in two anaerobic
      fluidized bed reactors (AFBR) using cheese whey (AFBR-CW = 10,000 mg sugars
      L(-1)) and vinasse (AFBR-V = 10,000 mg COD L(-1)) as substrates. Decreasing the
      HRT to 0.5 h increased the hydrogen production rates in both reactors, with
      maximum values of 5.36 +/- 0.81 L H2 h(-1) L(-1) in AFBR-CW and 0.71 +/- 0.16 L
      H2 h(-1) L(-1) in AFBR-V. The optimal conditions for hydrogen production were the
      HRT of 4 h and temperature of 65 degrees C in AFBR-CW, observing maximum hydrogen
      yield (HY) of 5.51 +/- 0.37 mmol H2 g COD(-1). Still, the maximum HY in AFBR-V
      was 1.64 +/- 0.22 mmol H2 g COD(-1) at 4 h and 55 degrees C. However, increasing 
      the temperature to 75 degrees C reduced the hydrogen production in both reactors.
      Methanol and butyric, acetic, and lactic acids were the main metabolites at
      temperatures of 55 and 65 degrees C, favoring the butyric and acetic metabolic
      pathways of hydrogen production. The increased productions of lactate,
      propionate, and methanol at 75 degrees C indicate that the hydrogen-producing
      bacteria in the thermophilic inoculum were inhibited under hyperthermophilic
      conditions.

TI  - Contribution of Pentose Catabolism to Molecular Hydrogen Formation by Targeted
      Disruption of Arabinose Isomerase (araA) in the Hyperthermophilic Bacterium
      Thermotoga maritima.
LID - e02631-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/AEM.02631-16 [doi]
AB  - Thermotoga maritima ferments a broad range of sugars to form acetate, carbon
      dioxide, traces of lactate, and near theoretic yields of molecular hydrogen (H2).
      In this organism, the catabolism of pentose sugars such as arabinose depends on
      the interaction of the pentose phosphate pathway with the Embden-Myerhoff and
      Entner-Doudoroff pathways. Although the values for H2 yield have been determined 
      using pentose-supplemented complex medium and predicted by metabolic pathway
      reconstruction, the actual effect of pathway elimination on hydrogen production
      has not been reported due to the lack of a genetic method for the creation of
      targeted mutations. Here, a spontaneous and genetically stable pyrE deletion
      mutant was isolated and used as a recipient to refine transformation methods for 
      its repair by homologous recombination. To verify the occurrence of recombination
      and to assess the frequency of crossover events flanking the deleted region, a
      synthetic pyrE allele, encoding synonymous nucleotide substitutions, was used.
      Targeted inactivation of araA (encoding arabinose isomerase) in the pyrE mutant
      was accomplished using a divergent, codon-optimized Thermosipho africanus pyrE
      allele fused to the T. maritima groES promoter as a genetic marker. Mutants
      lacking araA were unable to catabolize arabinose in a defined medium. The araA
      mutation was then repaired using targeted recombination. Levels of synthesis of
      H2 using arabinose-supplemented complex medium by wild-type and araA mutant cell 
      lines were compared. The difference between strains provided a direct measurement
      of H2 production that was dependent on arabinose consumption. Development of a
      targeted recombination system for genetic manipulation of T. maritima provides a 
      new strategy to explore H2 formation and life at an extremely high temperature in
      the bacterial domain. IMPORTANCE: We describe here the development of a genetic
      system for manipulation of Thermotoga maritima T. maritima is a hyperthermophilic
      anaerobic bacterium that is well known for its efficient synthesis of molecular
      hydrogen (H2) from the fermentation of sugars. Despite considerable efforts to
      advance compatible genetic methods, chromosome manipulation has remained elusive 
      and hindered use of T. maritima or its close relatives as model
      hyperthermophiles. Lack of a genetic method also prevented efforts to manipulate 
      specific metabolic pathways to measure their contributions to H2 yield. To
      overcome this barrier, a homologous chromosomal recombination method was
      developed and used to characterize the contribution of arabinose catabolism to H2
      formation. We report here a stable genetic method for a hyperthermophilic
      bacterium that will advance studies on the basic and synthetic biology of
      Thermotogales.

AB  - Two novel anaerobic, mesophilic, biohydrogen-producing bacteria, designated
      strains ZGM211T and G1T, were isolated from lake sediment. 16S rRNA and ATP
      synthase beta subunit (atpD) gene sequences and phylogenetic analysis of strains 
      ZGM211T and G1T revealed an affiliation to the genus Clostridium sensu stricto
      (cluster I of the clostridia), with Clostridium acetobutylicum as the closest
      characterized species, showing the same sequence similarity of 96.4 % to the type
      strain (98.9 % between the two isolates). Cells of the two strains were rod
      shaped. Growth occurred at 20-45 degrees C, pH 4.0-8.0 and NaCl concentrations up
      to 2 % (w/v). Grown on glucose, the main fermentation products were H2, CO2,
      acetate and butyrate. The major fatty acids were C14 : 0 and C16 : 0. The DNA G+C
      contents of strains ZGM211T and G1T were 40.7 and 41.5 mol%, respectively. Based 
      on phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic differences, strains ZGM211T
      (=CICC 24070T=BCRC 80950T) and G1T (=CICC 24069T=BCRC 80949T) are proposed as the
      type strains of novel species of the genus Clostridium with the names Clostridium
      guangxiense sp. nov. and Clostridium neuense sp. nov., respectively.

AB  - In this study, the feasibility of biohydrogen production from enzymatic
      hydrolysis of food waste was investigated. Food waste (solid-to-liquid ratio of
      10%, w/v) was first hydrolyzed by commercial glucoamylase to release glucose
      (24.35 g/L) in the food waste hydrolysate. Then, the obtained food waste
      hydrolysate was used as substrate for biohydrogen production in the batch and
      continuous (continuous stirred tank reactor, CSTR) systems. It was observed that 
      the maximum cumulative hydrogen production of 5850 mL was achieved with a yield
      of 245.7 mL hydrogen/g glucose (1.97 mol hydrogen/mol glucose) in the batch
      system. In the continuous system, the effect of hydraulic retention time (HRT) on
      biohydrogen production from food waste hydrolysate was investigated. The optimal 
      HRT obtained from this study was 6 h with the highest hydrogen production rate of
      8.02 mmol/(h.L). Ethanol and acetate were the major soluble microbial products
      with low propionate production at all HRTs. Enzymatic hydrolysis of food waste
      could effectively accelerate hydrolysis speed, improve substrate utilization rate
      and increase hydrogen yield.

TI  - Continuous production of biohythane from hydrothermal liquefied cornstalk biomass
      via two-stage high-rate anaerobic reactors.
PG  - 254
AB  - BACKGROUND: Biohythane production via two-stage fermentation is a promising
      direction for sustainable energy recovery from lignocellulosic biomass. However, 
      the utilization of lignocellulosic biomass suffers from specific natural
      recalcitrance. Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is an emerging technology for the 
      liquefaction of biomass, but there are still several challenges for the coupling 
      of HTL and two-stage fermentation. One particular challenge is the limited
      efficiency of fermentation reactors at a high solid content of the treated
      feedstock. Another is the conversion of potential inhibitors during fermentation.
      Here, we report a novel strategy for the continuous production of biohythane from
      cornstalk through the integration of HTL and two-stage fermentation. Cornstalk
      was converted to solid and liquid via HTL, and the resulting liquid could be
      subsequently fed into the two-stage fermentation systems. The systems consisted
      of two typical high-rate reactors: an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) and 
      a packed bed reactor (PBR). The liquid could be efficiently converted into
      biohythane via the UASB and PBR with a high density of microbes at a high organic
      loading rate. RESULTS: Biohydrogen production decreased from 2.34 L/L/day in UASB
      (1.01 L/L/day in PBR) to 0 L/L/day as the organic loading rate (OLR) of the HTL
      liquid products increased to 16 g/L/day. The methane production rate achieved a
      value of 2.53 (UASB) and 2.54 L/L/day (PBR), respectively. The energy and carbon 
      recovery of the integrated HTL and biohythane fermentation system reached up to
      79.0 and 67.7%, respectively. The fermentation inhibitors, i.e., 5-hydroxymethyl 
      furfural (41.4-41.9% of the initial quantity detected) and furfural (74.7-85.0%
      of the initial quantity detected), were degraded during hydrogen fermentation.
      Compared with single-stage fermentation, the methane process during two-stage
      fermentation had a more efficient methane production rate, acetogenesis, and COD 
      removal. The microbial distribution via Illumina MiSeq sequencing clarified that 
      the biohydrogen process in the two-stage systems functioned not only for
      biohydrogen production, but also for the degradation of potential inhibitors. The
      higher distribution of the detoxification family Clostridiaceae, Bacillaceae, and
      Pseudomonadaceae was found in the biohydrogen process. In addition, a higher
      distribution of acetate-oxidizing bacteria (Spirochaetaceae) was observed in the 
      biomethane process of the two-stage systems, revealing improved acetogenesis
      accompanied with an efficient conversion of acetate. CONCLUSIONS: Biohythane
      production could be a promising process for the recovery of energy and
      degradation of organic compounds from hydrothermal liquefied biomass. The
      two-stage process not only contributed to the improved quality of the gas fuels
      but also strengthened the biotransformation process, which resulted from the
      function of detoxification during biohydrogen production and enhanced
      acetogenesis during biomethane production.

AB  - The direct generation of electricity from the most abundant renewable sugar,
      glucose, is an appealing alternative to the production of liquid biofuels and
      biohydrogen. However, enzyme-catalyzed bioelectricity generation from glucose
      suffers from low yields due to the incomplete oxidation of the six-carbon
      compound glucose via one or few enzymes. Here, we demonstrate a synthetic ATP-
      and CoA-free 12-enzyme pathway to implement the complete oxidation of glucose in 
      vitro. This pathway is comprised of glucose phosphorylation via polyphosphate
      glucokinase, NADH generation catalyzed by glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase
      (G6PDH) and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGDH), electron transfer from NADH
      to the anode, and glucose 6-phosphate regeneration via the non-oxidative pentose 
      phosphate pathway and gluconeogenesis. The faraday efficiency from glucose to
      electrons via this pathway was as high as 98.8%, suggesting the generation of
      nearly 24 electrons per molecule of glucose. The generated current density was
      greatly increased from 2.8 to 6.9mAcm(-2) by replacing a low-activity G6PDH with 
      a high-activity G6PDH and introducing a new enzyme, 6-phosphogluconolactonase,
      between G6PDH and 6PGDH. These results suggest the great potential of high-yield 
      bioelectricity generation through in vitro metabolic engineering.

TI  - Membrane Complexes of Syntrophomonas wolfei Involved in Syntrophic Butyrate
      Degradation and Hydrogen Formation.
PG  - 1795
AB  - Syntrophic butyrate metabolism involves the thermodynamically unfavorable
      production of hydrogen and/or formate from the high potential electron donor,
      butyryl-CoA. Such redox reactions can occur only with energy input by a process
      called reverse electron transfer. Previous studies have demonstrated that
      hydrogen production from butyrate requires the presence of a proton gradient, but
      the biochemical machinery involved has not been clearly elucidated. In this
      study, the gene and enzyme systems involved in reverse electron transfer by
      Syntrophomonas wolfei were investigated using proteomic and gene expression
      approaches. S. wolfei was grown in co-culture with Methanospirillum hungatei or
      Dehalococcoides mccartyi under conditions requiring reverse electron transfer and
      compared to both axenic S. wolfei cultures and co-cultures grown in conditions
      that do not require reverse electron transfer. Blue native gel analysis of
      membranes solubilized from syntrophically grown cells revealed the presence of a 
      membrane-bound hydrogenase, Hyd2, which exhibited hydrogenase activity during in 
      gel assays. Bands containing a putative iron-sulfur (FeS) oxidoreductase were
      detected in membranes of crotonate-grown and butyrate grown S. wolfei cells. The 
      genes for the corresponding hydrogenase subunits, hyd2ABC, were differentially
      expressed at higher levels during syntrophic butyrate growth when compared to
      growth on crotonate. The expression of the FeS oxidoreductase gene increased when
      S. wolfei was grown with M. hungatei. Additional membrane-associated proteins
      detected included FoF1 ATP synthase subunits and several membrane transporters
      that may aid syntrophic growth. Furthermore, syntrophic butyrate metabolism can
      proceed exclusively by interspecies hydrogen transfer, as demonstrated by growth 
      with D. mccartyi, which is unable to use formate. These results argue for the
      importance of Hyd2 and FeS oxidoreductase in reverse electron transfer during
      syntrophic butyrate degradation.

AB  - During anaerobic fermentation, consequent accumulation of acidic fermented
      products leads to the failure of pH homeostasis. The present study aimed to
      comprehend the changes in buffering capacity with addition of sodium salts of
      hydroxide, bicarbonate and phosphate. The results showed notable augmentation in 
      buffer capacity and cumulative hydrogen production (CHP) compared to control. The
      influential factor is the amount of undissociated volatile fatty acids released
      that affected the cell metabolism and consequently biohydrogen generation. It is 
      inferred that among the tested salts, sodium bicarbonate has substantial
      buffering capacity (beta, 0.035+/- mol) ensuing maximum CHP (468+/- mL). Besides,
      bioelectrochemical analysis revealed variations in redox currents that aligned
      with biohydrogen production. The study provides valuable information on the role 
      of inorganic dissolved salts that would be required to regulate H2 generation and
      acidogenesis in the aspects of acid-gas phase system.

AB  - Biohydrogen is produced by a number of microbial systems and the commonly used
      host bacterium Escherichia coli naturally produces hydrogen under fermentation
      conditions. One approach to engineering additional hydrogen production pathways
      is to introduce non-native hydrogenases into E. coli. An attractive candidate is 
      the soluble [NiFe]-hydrogenase from Ralstonia eutropha, which has been shown to
      link NADH/NAD(+) biochemistry directly to hydrogen metabolism, an activity that
      E. coli does not perform. In this work, three synthetic operons were designed
      that code for the soluble hydrogenase and two different enzyme maturase systems. 
      Interestingly, using this system, the recombinant soluble hydrogenase was found
      to be assembled by the native E. coli [NiFe]-hydrogenase assembly machinery, and,
      vice versa, the synthetic maturase operons were able to complement E. coli
      mutants defective in hydrogenase biosynthesis. The heterologously expressed
      soluble hydrogenase was found to be active and was shown to produce biohydrogen
      in vivo.

TI  - Effects of pH and substrate concentrations on dark fermentative biohydrogen
      production from xylose by extreme thermophilic mixed culture.
PG  - 7
AB  - Biohydrogen is considered as one of the most promising energy alternatives
      considering the climate and energy crisis. The dark fermentative hydrogen
      production from xylose at extreme thermophilic condition (70 degrees C) using
      mixed culture was conducted in this study. The effects of initial pH values
      (ranged from 5.0 to 10.0) and substrate concentrations (ranged from 2.5 to 15.0
      g/L) on the hydrogen production, substrate degradation and metabolite
      distributions were investigated using batch-mode operations. Results showed that 
      initial substrate pH values in the neutral region (6.0-7.0) were beneficial for
      hydrogen production. The fermentation at initial pH 7.0 and 7.5 g/L xylose
      reached an optimal hydrogen yield of 1.29 mol-H2/mol-xyloseconsumed. Ethanol,
      butyrate, and propionate were the major liquid metabolites. The xylose
      biodegradation efficiency of the mixed culture decreased sharply at high initial 
      culture pH values. The increase of xylose concentration resulted in the
      accumulation of propionate and an obvious decrease in the final pH value, as well
      as a low hydrogen yield. Polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel
      electrophoresis analysis indicated that hydrogen producing bacteria were enriched
      by repeated culture under extreme thermophilic conditions. Also, the mixed
      culture was dominated with bacterial species related to Clostridium and
      Thermoanaerobacterium.

AB  - Citrus crops are among the most abundant crops in the world, which processing is 
      mainly based on juice extraction, generating large amounts of effluents with
      properties that turn them into potential pollution sources if they are improperly
      discarded. This study evaluated the potential for bioconversion of effluents from
      citrus-processing industry (wastewater and vinasse) into hydrogen through the
      dark fermentation process, by applying anaerobic sewage sludge as inoculum. The
      inoculum was previously heat treated to eliminate H2-consumers microorganisms and
      improve its activity. Anaerobic batch reactors were operated in triplicate with
      increasing proportions (50, 80 and 100%) of each effluent as substrate at 37
      degrees C, pH 5.5. Citrus effluents had different effects on inoculum growth and 
      H2 yields, demonstrated by profiles of acetic acid, butyric acid, propionic acid 
      and ethanol, the main by-products generated. It was verified that there was an
      increase in the production of biogas with the additions of either wastewater
      (7.3, 33.4 and 85.3mmolL(-1)) or vinasse (8.8, 12.7 and 13.4mmolL(-1)) in
      substrate. These effluents demonstrated remarkable energetic reuse perspectives: 
      24.0MJm(-3) and 4.0MJm(-3), respectively. Besides promoting the integrated
      management and mitigation of anaerobic sludge and effluents from citrus industry,
      the biohydrogen production may be an alternative for the local energy supply,
      reducing the operational costs in their own facilities, while enabling a better
      utilization of the biological potential contained in sewage sludges.

AB  - Ralstonia eutropha is a hydrogen-oxidizing ("Knallgas") bacterium that can easily
      switch between heterotrophic and autotrophic metabolism to thrive in aerobic and 
      anaerobic environments. Its versatile metabolism makes R. eutropha an attractive 
      host for biotechnological applications, including H2-driven production of
      biodegradable polymers and hydrocarbons. H2 oxidation by R. eutropha takes place 
      in the presence of O2 and is mediated by four hydrogenases, which represent ideal
      model systems for both biohydrogen production and H2 utilization. The so-called
      soluble hydrogenase (SH) couples reversibly H2 oxidation with the reduction of
      NAD(+) to NADH and has already been applied successfully in vitro and in vivo for
      cofactor regeneration. Thus, the interaction of the SH with the cellular
      NADH/NAD(+) pool is of major interest. In this work, we applied the fluorescent
      biosensor Peredox to measure the [NADH]:[NAD(+)] ratio in R. eutropha cells under
      different metabolic conditions. The results suggest that the sensor operates
      close to saturation level, indicating a rather high [NADH]:[NAD(+)] ratio in
      aerobically grown R. eutropha cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
      multicomponent analysis of spectrally-resolved fluorescence lifetime data of the 
      Peredox sensor response to different [NADH]:[NAD(+)] ratios represents a novel
      and sensitive tool to determine the redox state of cells.

AB  - Hydrogen production from starch by a co-culture hybrid dark and photofermentation
      under repeated fed-batch conditions at different organic loading rates (OLR) was 
      studied. Effective cooperation between bacteria in co-culture during initial days
      was observed at controlled pH 7.0. However, at pH above 6.5 dark fermentation
      phase was redirected from H2 formation towards production of formic acid, lactic 
      acid and ethanol (which are not coupled with hydrogen production) with
      simultaneous lower starch removal efficiency. This resulted in decrease in the
      hydrogen production rate. The highest H2 production in co-culture process
      (3.23LH2/Lmedium - after 11days) was achieved at OLR of 1.5gstarch/L/day, and it 
      was twofold higher than for dark fermentation process (1.59LH2/Lmedium). The
      highest H2 yield in the co-culture (2.62molH2/molhexose) was obtained at the OLR 
      of 0.375gstarch/L/day. Different pH requirements of bacteria were proven to be a 
      key limitation in co-culture system.

TI  - Multi-species Identification of Polymorphic Peptide Variants via Propagation in
      Spectral Networks.
PG  - 3501-3512
AB  - Peptide and protein identification remains challenging in organisms with poorly
      annotated or rapidly evolving genomes, as are commonly encountered in
      environmental or biofuels research. Such limitations render tandem mass
      spectrometry (MS/MS) database search algorithms ineffective as they lack
      corresponding sequences required for peptide-spectrum matching. We address this
      challenge with the spectral networks approach to (1) match spectra of orthologous
      peptides across multiple related species and then (2) propagate peptide
      annotations from identified to unidentified spectra. We here present algorithms
      to assess the statistical significance of spectral alignments (Align-GF), reduce 
      the impurity in spectral networks, and accurately estimate the error rate in
      propagated identifications. Analyzing three related Cyanothece species, a model
      organism for biohydrogen production, spectral networks identified peptides from
      highly divergent sequences from networks with dozens of variant peptides,
      including thousands of peptides in species lacking a sequenced genome. Our
      analysis further detected the presence of many novel putative peptides even in
      genomically characterized species, thus suggesting the possibility of gaps in our
      understanding of their proteomic and genomic expression. A web-based pipeline for
      spectral networks analysis is available at http://proteomics.ucsd.edu/software.

AB  - Hydrogen production by cyanobacteria could be one of the promising energy
      resources in the future. However, there is very limited information regarding the
      kinetic modeling of hydrogen production by cyanobacteria available in the
      literature. To provide an in-depth understanding of the biological system
      involved during the process, the Haldane's noncompetitive inhibition equation has
      been modified to determine the specific hydrogen production rate (HPR) as a
      function of both dissolved CO2 concentration (CTOT) and oxygen production rate
      (OPR). The highest HPR of 15 [Formula: see text] was found at xCO2 of 5% vol/vol 
      and the rate consequently decreased when the CTOT and OPR were 0.015 k mol m(-3) 
      and 0.55 mL h(-1), respectively. The model provided a fairly good estimation of
      the HPR with respect to the experimental data collected.

TI  - The Evolution and Versatility of Microalgal Biotechnology: A Review.
PG  - 1104-1123
LID - 10.1111/1541-4337.12227 [doi]
AB  - Microalgal biotechnology has emerged due to the health-promoting properties of
      microalgae related to their bioactive compounds and the great diversity of
      products that can be developed from algal biomass. Microalgal biomasses have been
      produced industrially for applications in different fields such as food,
      pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, cosmetic, and animal feed industries. They can be 
      cultivated either in open systems or in closed systems (photobioreactors).
      Another important area is the use of microalgal biomass for energy production. It
      has become obvious that petroleum-derived fuels are unsustainable, due to
      depleting world reserves and greenhouse gas emissions. Microalgae can provide
      several different types of renewable biofuels. These include methane produced by 
      anaerobic digestion of the algal biomass, biodiesel derived from
      trans-esterification of microalgal lipids, bioethanol produced from carbohydrate 
      fermentations, and photobiologically produced biohydrogen. The idea of using
      microalgae as a source of fuel is not new. However, it is now being taken
      seriously because of increases in petroleum prices and, more significantly, the
      increasing concern about global warming as associated with burning fossil fuels. 
      This review offers an update on information about microalgae, specifically
      emphasizing their biotechnological importance.

AB  - The present study investigates the effect of spent media of acetogenic dark
      fermentation for mixotrophic algal cultivation for biodiesel production.
      Mixotrophic growth conditions were optimized in culture flask (250mL) using
      Chlorella sp. MJ 11/11. Maximum lipid accumulation (58% w/w) was observed under
      light intensity, pH, nitrate and phosphate concentration of 100mumolm(-2)s(-1),
      7, 2.7mM and 1.8mM, respectively. Air lift (1.4L) and flat panel (1.4L) reactors 
      were considered for algal cultivation. Air lift showed significant improvement in
      biomass and lipid production as compared to flat panel reactor. The results could
      help in development of sustainable technology involving acetogenic hydrogen
      production integrated with sequential mitigation of spent media by algal
      cultivation for improved energy recovery.

      hydrogenases.
PG  - 36034
LID - 10.1038/srep36034 [doi]
AB  - Biological hydrogen production is based on activity of specific enzymes called
      hydrogenases. Hydrogenases are oxygen sensitive metalloenzymes containing Ni
      and/or Fe atoms at the active site, catalyzing reversible reduction of protons.
      Generally, [Fe-Fe] hydrogenases prefer proton reduction to molecular hydrogen, a 
      potential energy carrier molecule that can be produced by bioprocesses in
      sustainable manner. Thus, monitoring tools have been developed to study the
      relationship between [Fe-Fe] hydrogenases and biohydrogen production in
      bioreactors at DNA and RNA levels. In the present study, novel molecular tools
      are introduced for quantitative monitoring of clostridial [Fe-Fe] hydrogenases at
      the protein level. Aerobic and anaerobic biopanning (for inactive and active
      [Fe-Fe] hydrogenase, respectively) of phage displayed single-chain variable
      fragment (scFv) antibody libraries aided in isolating nine potential scFvs. The
      enriched antibodies demonstrated high specificity towards Clostridium spp.
      [Fe-Fe] hydrogenases allowing detection from pure and mixed cultures.
      Additionally, the antibodies showed different binding characteristics towards
      hydrogenase catalytic states, providing a possible means for functional detection
      of clostridial [Fe-Fe] hydrogenases. From hydrogenase-antibody interaction
      studies we observed that though antibody binding reduced the enzyme catalytic
      activity, it facilitated to retain hydrogen evolution from oxygen exposed
      hydrogenases.

AB  - This study evaluated the impact of furfural (a furan derivative) on hydrogen
      production rates and yields at initial substrate-to-microorganism ratios (S
      degrees /X degrees ) of 4, 2, 1, and 0.5gCOD/gVSS and furfural concentrations of 
      4, 2, 1, and 0.5g/L. Fermentation studies were carried out in batches using
      synthetic lignocellulosic hydrolysate as substrate and mesophilic anaerobic
      digester sludge as seed. Contrary to other literature studies where furfural was 
      inhibitory, this study showed that furfural concentrations of up to 1g/L enhanced
      hydrogen production with yields as high as 19% from the control (batch without
      furfural). Plots of hydrogen yields against gfurfural/gsugars and hydrogen yields
      versus gfurfural/gbiomass showed negative linear correlation indicating that
      these parameters influence biohydrogen production. Regression analysis indicated 
      that gfurfural/gsugarsinitial exerted a greater effect on the degree of
      inhibition of hydrogen production than gfurfural/gVSSfinal.

AB  - The impact on dark fermentation of seven carbohydrates as model substrates of
      lignocellulosic fractions (glucose, cellobiose, microcrystalline cellulose,
      arabinose, xylose, xylan and wheat straw) was investigated. Metabolic patterns
      and bacterial communities were characterized at the end of batch tests inoculated
      with manure digestate. It was found that hydrogen production was linked to the
      sugar type (pentose or hexose) and the degree of polymerisation. Hexoses produced
      less hydrogen, with a specific selection of lactate-producing bacterial community
      structures. Maximal hydrogen production was five times higher on pentose-based
      substrates, with specific bacterial community structures producing acetate and
      butyrate as main metabolites. Low hydrogen amounts accumulated from complex
      sugars (cellulose, xylan and wheat straw). A relatively high proportion of the
      reads was affiliated to Ruminococcaceae suggesting an efficient hydrolytic
      activity. Knowing that the bacterial community structure is very specific to a
      particular substrate offers new possibilities to design more efficient
      H2-producing biological systems.

AB  - A native microalgae consortium treated under thermal-acidic hydrolysis was used
      to produce hydrogen and methane in a two-step sequential process. Different acid 
      concentrations were tested, generating hydrogen and methane yields of up to
      45mLH2gVS(-1) and 432mLCH4gVS(-1), respectively. The hydrogen production step
      solubilized the particulate COD (chemical oxygen demand) up to 30%, creating
      considerable amounts of volatile fatty acids (up to 10gCODL(-1)). It was observed
      that lower acid concentration presented higher hydrogen and methane production
      potential. The results revealed that thermal acid hydrolysis of a native
      microalgae consortium is a simple but effective strategy for producing hydrogen
      and methane in the sequential process. In addition to COD removal (50-70%), this 
      method resulted in an energy recovery of up to 15.9kJ per g of volatile solids of
      microalgae biomass, one of the highest reported.

AB  - Biohydrogen production from waste bread in a continuous stirred tank reactor
      (CSTR) was techno-economically assessed. The treating capacity of the
      H2-producing plant was assumed to be 2 ton waste bread per day with lifetime of
      10years. Aspen Plus was used to simulate the mass and energy balance of the
      plant. The total capital investment (TCI), total annual production cost (TAPC)
      and annual revenue of the plant were USD931020, USD299746/year and
      USD639920/year, respectively. The unit hydrogen production cost was USD1.34/m(3) 
      H2 (or USD14.89/kg H2). The payback period and net present value (NPV) of the
      plant were 4.8years and USD1266654, respectively. Hydrogen price and operators
      cost were the most important variables on the NPV. It was concluded that
      biohydrogen production from waste bread in the CSTR was feasible for practical
      application.

AB  - In this study, microbial responses of a continuous hydrogen reactor fed with
      galactose have been investigated. Process disturbances reduced H2 production
      performance as well as large fluctuations in microbial diversity. The peak values
      of the hydrogen yield (HY) was not influenced greatly during the steady state
      period, and accounted as 2.01 +/- 0.05 and 2.14 +/- 0.03 mol/mol galactoseadded, 
      while hydraulic retention time (HRT) was at 12 and 8 h, respectively. Microbial
      community analysis via 454 pyrosequencing revealed that functional redundancy
      following changes in the microbial community distribution led to the stability of
      the fermentation performance. The butyrate to acetate (B/A) ratio well correlated
      with changes in the microbial community. The energy generation rate and energy
      yield resulted in the peak values of 134 kJ/L-d and 612 kJ/moladded.

AB  - This study was undertaken to investigate the reduction of the hydraulic retention
      time (HRT) to decrease methane generation and recover hydrogen production during 
      the long-term operation of biohydrogen production in a continuous stirred tank
      reactor (CSTR) using molasses wastewater. Reduction of HRT can be a simple and
      economic method to immediately control unfavorable methane generated during
      continuous operation of a hydrogen production system. The steady-state
      performance of the CSTR showed a hydrogen content of 41.3 +/- 3.30% and a
      hydrogen production rate (HPR) of 63.7 +/- 10.01 mmol-H2L(-1)d(-1) under an
      organic loading rate (OLR) of 29.7 g CODL(-1) at an HRT of 24 h. Increase in the 
      methane level above 40% during long-term operation caused decrease in the
      hydrogen content and HPR to 5.9 +/- 1.6% and 2.1 +/- 1.1 mmoL-H2L(-1)d(-1),
      respectively. When methane increased to a high level over 40%, the CSTR at the
      HRT of 24 h was operated at the HRT of 12 h. Reduction of the HRT from 24 to 12 h
      led to decrease in the methane content of 12.1 +/- 4.44% and recovery of the HPR 
      value to 48.9 +/- 15.37 mmol-H2L(-1)d(-1) over a duration of 13-22 d. When
      methane is generated in a continuously operated reactor, reduction of the HRT can
      be an easy way to suppress methanogens and recover hydrogen production without
      any additives or extra treatments.

      food waste using an integrated system of a continuously stirred tank reactor
      (CSTR) and anaerobic fixed bed reactor (AFBR) was carried out in this study. The 
      system performance was evaluated for an operation period of 200days, by stepwise 
      shortening the hydraulic retention time (HRT). An increasing trend of biohydrogen
      in the CSTR and methane production rate in the AFBR was observed regardless of
      the HRT shortening. The highest biohydrogen yield in the CSTR and methane yield
      in the AFBR were 115.2 (+/-5.3)L H2/kgVSadded and 334.7 (+/-18.6)L
      CH4/kgCODadded, respectively. The AFBR presented a stable operation and excellent
      performance, indicated by the increased methane production rate at each shortened
      HRT. Besides, recirculation of the AFBR effluent to the CSTR was effective in
      providing alkalinity, maintaining the pH in optimal ranges (5.0-5.3) for the
      hydrogen producing bacteria.

AB  - The biodiesel industry has the potential to meet the fuel requirements in the
      future. A few inherent lacunae of this bioprocess are the effluent, which is 10 %
      of the actual product, and the fact that it is 85 % glycerol along with a few
      impurities. Biological treatments of wastes have been known as a dependable and
      economical direction of overseeing them and bring some value added products as
      well. A novel eco-biotechnological strategy employs metabolically diverse
      bacteria, which ensures higher reproducibility and economics. In this article, we
      have opined, which organisms and what bioproducts should be the focus, while
      exploiting glycerol as feed.

AB  - The anaerobic digestion process has been primarily utilized for methane
      containing biogas production over the past few years. However, the digestion
      process could also be optimized for producing volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and
      biohydrogen. This is the first review article that combines the optimization
      approaches for all three possible products from the anaerobic digestion. In this 
      review study, the types and configurations of the bioreactor are discussed for
      each type of product. This is followed by a review on optimization of common
      process parameters (e.g. temperature, pH, retention time and organic loading
      rate) separately for the production of VFA, biohydrogen and methane. This review 
      also includes additional parameters, treatment methods or special additives that 
      wield a significant and positive effect on production rate and these products'
      yield.

AB  - The contribution and insights of the immobilization technology in the recent
      years with regards to the generation of (bio)hydrogen via dark fermentation have 
      been reviewed. The types of immobilization practices, such as entrapment,
      encapsulation and adsorption, are discussed. Materials and carriers used for cell
      immobilization are also comprehensively surveyed. New development of nano-based
      immobilization and nano-materials has been highlighted pertaining to the specific
      subject of this review. The microorganisms and the type of carbon sources applied
      in the dark hydrogen fermentation are also discussed and summarized. In addition,
      the essential components of process operation and reactor configuration using
      immobilized microbial cultures in the design of varieties of bioreactors (such as
      fixed bed reactor, CSTR and UASB) are spotlighted. Finally, suggestions and
      future directions of this field are provided to assist the development of
      efficient, economical and sustainable hydrogen production technologies.

TI  - Contributing factors in the improvement of cellulosic H2 production in
      Clostridium thermocellum/Thermoanaerobacterium co-cultures.
PG  - 8607-20
LID - 10.1007/s00253-016-7776-1 [doi]
AB  - Lignocellulosic biohydrogen is a promising renewable energy source that could be 
      a potential alternative to the unsustainable fossil fuel-based energy.
      Biohydrogen production could be performed by Clostridium thermocellum that is the
      fastest known cellulose-degrading bacterium. Previous investigations have shown
      that the co-culture of C. thermocellum JN4 and a non-cellulolytic bacterium
      Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum GD17 produces more hydrogen than the 
      C. thermocellum JN4 mono-culture, but the mechanism of this improvement is
      unknown. In this work, we carried out genomic and evolutionary analysis of
      hydrogenase-coding genes in C. thermocellum and T. thermosaccharolyticum,
      identifying one Ech-type [NiFe] hydrogenase complex in each species, and,
      respectively, five and four monomeric or multimeric [FeFe] hydrogenases in the
      two species. Further transcriptional analysis showed hydrogenase-coding genes in 
      C. thermocellum are regulated by carbon sources, while hydrogenase-coding genes
      in T. thermosaccharolyticum are not. However, comparison between transcriptional 
      abundance of hydrogenase-coding genes in mono- and co-cultures showed the
      co-culturing condition leads to transcriptional changes of hydrogenase-coding
      genes in T. thermosaccharolyticum but not C. thermocellum. Further metabolic
      analysis showed T. thermosaccharolyticum produces H2 at a rate 4-12-fold higher
      than C. thermocellum. These findings lead to the suggestion that the improvement 
      of H2 production in the co-culture over mono-culture should be attributed to
      changes in T. thermosaccharolyticum but not C. thermocellum. Further suggestions 
      can be made that C. thermocellum and T. thermosaccharolyticum perform highly
      specialized tasks in the co-culture, and optimization of the co-culture for more 
      lignocellulosic biohydrogen production should be focused on the improvement of
      the non-cellulolytic bacterium.

AB  - For outdoor photobiological hydrogen production, the effective control of
      temperature in photobioreactors is a challenge. In this work, an internal cooling
      system for outdoor tubular photobioreactors was designed, built, and tested. The 
      temperatures in the reactors with bacteria were consistently higher than those
      without bacteria, and were also strongly influenced by solar irradiation and
      ambient air temperature. The cooling protocol applied successfully kept the
      reactor temperatures below the threshold limit (38 degrees C) required for the
      bioprocess and provided a uniform distribution of temperature along the reactor
      tube length. The biomass growth and hydrogen production were similar in the
      reactors cooled co-currently and counter-currently. The biomass growth rate was
      0.1 l/h, the maximum hydrogen production rate was 1.28 mol/m(3)/h, and the
      overall hydrogen yield obtained was 20 %. The change in the biomass was fitted
      using the logistic model while cumulative hydrogen production was fitted using
      the modified Gompertz equation.

AB  - The aims of this study were to simplify the fermentation medium and to optimize
      the conditions of dark fermentation of residual glycerin to produce biohydrogen. 
      It was possible to remove all micronutrients of fermentation medium and improve
      biohydrogen production by applying residual glycerin as feedstock. After
      statistical analysis of the following parameters pH, glycerin concentration and
      volatile suspended solids, the values of 5.5; 0.5g.L(-1) and 8.7g.L(-1),
      respectively, were defined as optimum condition for this process. It generated
      2.44molH2/molglycerin, an expressive result when compared to previous results
      reported in literature and considering that theoretical yield of H2 from glycerol
      in dark fermentation process is 3molH2/molglycerol. This study allowed the
      improvement of yield and productivity by 68% and 67%, respectively.

TI  - Multiple syntrophic interactions drive biohythane production from waste sludge in
      microbial electrolysis cells.
PG  - 162

AB  - BACKGROUND: Biohythane is a new and high-value transportation fuel present as a
      mixture of biomethane and biohydrogen. It has been produced from different
      organic matters using anaerobic digestion. Bioenergy can be recovered from waste 
      activated sludge through methane production during anaerobic digestion, but
      energy yield is often insufficient to sludge disposal. Microbial electrolysis
      cell (MEC) is also a promising approach for bioenergy recovery and waste sludge
      disposal as higher energy efficiency and biogas production. The systematic
      understanding of microbial interactions and biohythane production in MEC is still
      limited. Here, we report biohythane production from waste sludge in biocathode
      microbial electrolysis cells and reveal syntrophic interactions in microbial
      communities based on high-throughput sequencing and quantitative PCR targeting
      16S rRNA gene. RESULTS: The alkali-pretreated sludge fed MECs (AS-MEC) showed the
      highest biohythane production rate of 0.148 L.L(-1)-reactor.day(-1), which is 40 
      and 80 % higher than raw sludge fed MECs (RS-MEC) and anaerobic digestion (open
      circuit MEC, RS-OCMEC). Current density, metabolite profiles, and
      hydrogen-methane ratio results all confirm that alkali-pretreatment and microbial
      electrolysis greatly enhanced sludge hydrolysis and biohythane production.
      Illumina Miseq sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons indicates that anode biofilm
      was dominated by exoelectrogenic Geobacter, fermentative bacteria and
      hydrogen-producing bacteria in the AS-MEC. The cathode biofilm was dominated by
      fermentative Clostridium. The dominant archaeal populations on the cathodes of
      AS-MEC and RS-MEC were affiliated with hydrogenotrophic Methanobacterium (98 %,
      relative abundance) and Methanocorpusculum (77 %), respectively. Multiple
      pathways of gas production were observed in the same MEC reactor, including
      fermentative and electrolytic H2 production, as well as hydrogenotrophic
      methanogenesis and electromethanogenesis. Real-time quantitative PCR analyses
      showed that higher amount of methanogens were enriched in AS-MEC than that in
      RS-MEC and RS-OCMEC, suggesting that alkali-pretreated sludge and MEC facilitated
      hydrogenotrophic methanogen enrichment. CONCLUSION: This study proves for the
      first time that biohythane could be produced directly in biocathode MECs using
      waste sludge. MEC and alkali-pretreatment accelerated enrichment of
      hydrogenotrophic methanogen and hydrolysis of waste sludge. The results indicate 
      syntrophic interactions among fermentative bacteria, exoelectrogenic bacteria and
      methanogenic archaea in MECs are critical for highly efficient conversion of
      complex organics into biohythane, demonstrating that MECs can be more competitive
      than conventional anaerobic digestion for biohythane production using
      carbohydrate-deficient substrates. Biohythane production from waste sludge by MEC
      provides a promising new way for practical application of microbial
      electrochemical technology.

AB  - In this paper, biochemical hydrogen potential (BHP) tests were conducted to
      investigate H2 production from different substrate with acid-treated anaerobic
      digested sludge at the mesophilic range. The sludge was collected from an
      anaerobic digester and was subjected to sulfuric acid pretreatments at pH 3 for
      24 h. The effects of substrate type (glucose, fructose, and sucrose as carbon
      source) were investigated in batch experiments. Results showed that substrate
      degradation rate for all of the substrates was up 95 % and the electron
      equivalent balance showed good closure for glucose and sucrose. Batch experiments
      showed that the maximum molar hydrogen yield with glucose, fructose, and sucrose 
      was 3.27, 3.16, and 6.46 mol H2/mol of substrate. The maximum cumulative
      biohydrogen production was 1552, 1487, and 1366 mL and maximum hydrogen
      production rate was 308, 279, and 275 mL/h for glucose, sucrose, and fructose,
      respectively. The experimental results suggest that the formation of hydrogen
      associates with the main aqueous products, i.e., acetate butyrate.

AB  - Proof of principle of biohythane and potential energy production from garden
      waste (GW) is demonstrated in this study in a two-step process coupling dark
      fermentation and anaerobic digestion. The synergistic effect of using co-cultures
      of extreme thermophiles to intensify biohydrogen dark fermentation is
      demonstrated using xylose, cellobiose and GW. Co-culture of Caldicellulosiruptor 
      saccharolyticus and Thermotoga maritima showed higher hydrogen production yields 
      from xylose (2.7+/-0.1molmol(-1) total sugar) and cellobiose (4.8+/-0.3molmol(-1)
      total sugar) compared to individual cultures. Co-culture of extreme thermophiles 
      C. saccharolyticus and Caldicellulosiruptor bescii increased synergistically the 
      hydrogen production yield from GW (98.3+/-6.9Lkg(-1) (VS)) compared to individual
      cultures and co-culture of T. maritima and C. saccharolyticus. The biochemical
      methane potential of the fermentation end-products was 322+/-10Lkg(-1) (CODt).
      Biohythane, a biogas enriched with 15% hydrogen could be obtained from GW,
      yielding a potential energy generation of 22.2MJkg(-1) (VS).

      was of 0.06mWcm(-2)) electromagnetic irradiation (EMI) of extremely high
      frequencies or millimeter waves on the growth and hydrogen (H2) photoproduction
      by purple non-sulfur bacteria Rhodobacter sphaeroides MDC6521 (from Armenian
      mineral springs). After exposure of R. sphaeroides, grown under anaerobic
      conditions upon illumination, to EMI (51.8GHz and 53.0GHz) for 15min an increase 
      of specific growth rate by ~1.2-fold, in comparison with control (non-irradiated 
      cells), was obtained. However, the effect of EMI depends on the duration of
      irradiation: the exposure elongation up to 60min caused the delay of the growth
      lag phase and the decrease specific growth rate by ~1.3-fold, indicating the
      bactericidal effect of EMI. H2 yield of the culture, irradiated by EMI for 15min,
      determined during 72h growth, was ~1.2-fold higher than H2 yield of control
      cells, whereas H2 production by cultures, irradiated by EMI for 60min was not
      observed during 72h growth. This difference in the effects of extremely high
      frequency EMI indicates a direct effect of radiation on the membrane transfer and
      the enzymes of these bacteria. Moreover, EMI increased DCCD-inhibited H(+) fluxes
      across the bacterial membrane and DCCD-sensitive ATPase activity of membrane
      vesicles, indicating that the proton FoF1-ATPase is presumably a basic target for
      extremely high frequency EMI related to H2 production by cultures.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to develop a suitable pretreatment method to
      enhance the microbial degradation of lignocellulosic biomass and to maximize the 
      overall energy recovery by using biohythane process. An efficient and
      eco-friendly biological pretreatment was used. Maximum lignin removal using
      biological pretreatment of sugarcane top was 60.4% w/w after 21d incubation at 28
      degrees C in static condition. Confocal microscopy observation and FTIR analysis 
      confirmed the removal of lignin from sugarcane top. The maximum hydrogen
      production rate (Rm), hydrogen production potential (P) and lag time (lambda)
      using pretreated sugarcane top were 16.76mL/g-VS/h, 87.40mL/g-VS and 3.38h
      respectively. The maximum methane production potential using spent medium of dark
      fermentation was 180.86mL/g-VS with the lag time of 2.9d. The overall gaseous
      energy recovery was 37.7% which is 54% higher than that of the untreated one.

AB  - Biohydrogen and biomethane production offers many advantages for environmental
      protection over the fossil fuels or the existing physical-chemical methods for
      hydrogen and methane synthesis. The aim of this study is focused on the
      exploitation of several samples from the composting process: (1) a mixture of
      waste vegetable materials ("Mix"); (2) an unmatured compost sample (ACV15); and
      (3) three types of green compost with different properties and soil improver
      quality (ACV1, ACV2 and ACV3). These samples were tested for biohydrogen and
      biomethane production, thus obtaining second generation biofuels and resulting in
      a novel possibility to manage renewable waste biomasses. The ability of these
      substrates as original feed during dark fermentation was assayed anaerobically in
      batch, in glass bottles, in order to determine the optimal operating conditions
      for hydrogen and/or methane production using "Mix" or ACV1, ACV2 or ACV3 green
      compost and a limited amount of water. Hydrogen could be produced with a fast
      kinetic in the range 0.02-2.45mLH2g(-1)VS, while methane was produced with a
      slower kinetic in the range 0.5-8mLCH4g(-1)VS. It was observed that the
      composition of each sample influenced significantly the gas production. It was
      also observed that the addition of different water amounts play a crucial role in
      the development of hydrogen or methane. This parameter can be used to push
      towards the alternative production of one or another gas. Hydrogen and methane
      production was detected spontaneously from these matrices, without additional
      sources of nutrients or any pre-treatment, suggesting that they can be used as an
      additional inoculum or feed into single or two-stage plants. This might allow the
      use of compost with low quality as soil improver for alternative and further
      applications.
