TI  - A mutation in the putative CRP binding site of the dctA promoter of Salmonella
      enterica serovar Typhimurium enables growth with low orotate concentrations.
LID - 10.1139/cjm-2022-0120 [doi]
AB  - Salmonella enterica and Escherichia coli use the inner membrane transporter DctA 
      to import the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway intermediate orotate from the
      environment. To study the regulation of dctA expression, we used a S. enterica
      serovar Typhimurium pyrimidine auxotroph to select a mutant that could grow in an
      otherwise non-permissive culture medium containing glucose and a low
      concentration of orotate. Whole genome sequencing revealed a point mutation
      upstream of dctA in the putative cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) binding site. 
      The C->T transition converted the least-favourable base to the most-favourable
      base for CRP-DNA affinity. A dctA::lux transcriptional fusion confirmed that the 
      mutant dctA promoter gained responsiveness to CRP even in the presence of
      glucose. Moreover, dctA expression was higher in the mutant than the wild type in
      the presence of alternative carbon sources that activate CRP.

TI  - Protective effects of isofraxidin against scopolamine-induced cognitive and
      memory impairments in mice involve modulation of the BDNF-CREB-ERK signaling
      pathway.
LID - 10.1007/s11011-022-00980-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Isofraxidin is a coumarin compound mainly isolated from several
      traditional and functional edible plants beneficial for neurodegenerative
      diseases, including Sarcandra glabra and Apium graveolens, and Siberian Ginseng. 
      OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess effects of isofraxidin against memory
      impairments and cognition deficits in a scopolamine-induced mouse model.
      MATERIALS & METHODS: Animals were randomly divided into 6 groups, control,
      vehicle, donepezil (10 mg/kg, p.o.), and isofraxidin (3, 10, and 30 mg/kg, p.o.).
      Isofraxidin or donepezil was administered for 44 days, once per day. The
      scopolamine insults (1 mg/kg, i.p.) was given from the 21st day, once per day.
      Morris water maze test and Y-maze test were used for the behavioral test. After
      that, brain samples were collected for analysis. RESULTS: Firstly, isofraxidin
      significantly improved scopolamine-induced behavioral impairments and cognition
      deficits in Morris water maze and Y-maze test. Then, isofraxidin facilitated
      cholinergic activity via inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity.
      Besides, isofraxidin decreased lipid peroxidation level but enhanced levels of
      glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase. Moreover,
      isofraxidin suppressed the expression of inflammatory mediators and cytokines.
      Further investigations showed that isofraxidin up-regulated expression of
      brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and promoted phosphorylation of
      tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB), cyclic AMP-response element-binding protein 
      (CREB), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). DISCUSSION &
      CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested that isofraxidin ameliorated
      scopolamine-induced cognitive and memory impairments, possibly through regulating
      AChE activity, suppressing oxidative stress and inflammatory response, and
      modulating BDNF-CREB-ERK pathways.

TI  - Chemopreventive potential of Diosmin against benzo[a]pyrene induced lung
      carcinogenesis in Swiss Albino mice.
PG  - e23187
LID - 10.1002/jbt.23187 [doi]
AB  - Lung cancer, one of the most common cancer is a cause of concern associated with 
      cancer-related mortality. Benzo[a]pyrene [B(a)P], a potent carcinogen as well as 
      an environmental contaminant is reported to be found in cigarette smoke among
      various sources. The present study focuses on the chemopreventive potential of
      Diosmin against B[a]P-induced lung carcinogenesis and its possible mechanism in
      male Swiss Albino mice (SAM). SAM were treated orally with Diosmin (200 mg/kg
      b.w.) for 16 weeks and/or B[a]P (50 mg/kg b.w) for a period of 4 weeks. B[a]P
      treated cancerous mice showed increased peroxidation of membrane lipid as well as
      a decrease in the level/activity of antioxidant proteins. Cancerous mice also
      showed an increased level of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and neuron-specific
      enolase (NSE). Diosmin treatment, however, leads to decreased peroxidation of
      lipids, increased antioxidant proteins as well decrease in the level of CEA and
      NSE. B[a]P-induced cancerous animals also exhibited increased expression of
      cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB), COX2 as well as
      prostaglandin-E2 (PGE2) while Diosmin-treated mice were found to have an
      ameliorative effect. Histopathological results further confirm the protective
      effect of Diosmin in averting B[a]P-induced pathological alterations of lung
      tissue. Overall, our results suggest Diosmin exerts its chemopreventive potential
      possibly via targeting the CREB/cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)/PGE2 pathway thereby
      repressing inflammation.

TI  - Lysine-Tethered Stable Bicyclic Cationic Antimicrobial Peptide Combats Bacterial 
      Infection in Vivo.
LID - 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.2c00661 [doi]
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have attracted great attention as next generation
      antibiotics for the treatment of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial infections. 
      Poor proteolytic stability has however undermined clinical applications of AMPs. 
      A novel peptide cyclization approach is described to enhance the in vivo
      antibacterial activity of AMPs. Bicyclic antimicrobial peptides were synthesized 
      by cross-linking the epsilon-amino groups of three lysine residues with a
      1,3,5-trimethylene benzene spacer. In a proof of principal study, four bicyclic
      peptides were synthesized from the cationic AMP OH-CM6. One bicyclic peptide
      retained strong antimicrobial activity and low toxicity but exhibited a prolonged
      half-life in serum. Antibacterial activity was consequently improved in vivo
      without renal or hepato-toxicity. The novel peptide cyclization approach
      represents an important tool for enhancing AMP proteolytic stability for improved
      treatment of bacterial infection.

      pathway in lipopolysaccharide-challenged broilers.
PG  - 347-359
LID - 10.1016/j.aninu.2022.06.005 [doi]
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate the effects of glycerol monolaurate (GML)
      on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced immunological stress and intestinal mucosal
      injury in broilers and its underlying mechanisms. A total of 144 one-d-old Arbor 
      Acres broilers were allocated to a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement involving dietary 
      treatment (0 or 1,200 mg/kg dietary GML) and LPS challenge (injected with saline 
      or Escherichia coli LPS on d 16, 18, and 20). Samples were collected on d 21. The
      results revealed that dietary GML augmented serum immunoglobulin A (P = 0.009)
      and immunoglobulin G (P < 0.001) levels in challenged birds. Dietary GML
      normalized LPS-induced variations in serum interleukin-6, interferon-gamma, and
      LPS levels (P < 0.05), jejunal villus height (P = 0.030), and gene expression of 
      interleukin-6, macrophage inflammatory protein-3 alpha, Toll-like receptor 4,
      nuclear factor kappa-B, caspase-1, tight junction proteins, adenosine
      monophosphate-activated protein kinase alpha 1 (AMPKalpha1), nuclear
      factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and superoxide dismutase-1 (P <
      0.05). GML supplementation ameliorated LPS-induced peroxidation by reducing
      malondialdehyde content and increasing antioxidant enzyme activity (P < 0.05).
      Dietary GML enhanced the abundances of Anaerostipes, Pseudoflavonifractor, and
      Gordonibacter and reduced the proportion of Phascolarctobacterium in challenged
      birds. Dietary GML was positively correlated with alterations in antioxidant
      enzyme activities and AMPKalpha1, Nrf2, and zonula occludens-1 expressions. The
      genera Anaerostipes, Lachnospira, Gordonibacter, Lachnospira, Marvinbryantia,
      Peptococcus, and Pseudoflavonifractor were linked to attenuated inflammation and 
      improved antioxidant capacity of challenged birds. In conclusion, dietary GML
      alleviated LPS-induced immunological stress and intestinal injury of broilers by 
      suppressing inflammation and oxidative stress. Dietary GML regulated cecal
      microbiota and activated the AMPK/Nrf2 pathway in LPS-challenged broilers.

TI  - Bias and inconsistency in the estimation of tumour mutation burden.
PG  - 840
LID - 10.1186/s12885-022-09897-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tumour mutation burden (TMB), defined as the number of somatic
      mutations per megabase within the sequenced region in the tumour sample, has been
      used as a biomarker for predicting response to immune therapy. Several studies
      have been conducted to assess the utility of TMB for various cancer types;
      however, methods to measure TMB have not been adequately evaluated. In this
      study, we identified two sources of bias in current methods to calculate TMB.
      METHODS: We used simulated data to quantify the two sources of bias and their
      effect on TMB calculation, we down-sampled sequencing reads from exome sequencing
      datasets from TCGA to evaluate the consistency in TMB estimation across different
      sequencing depths. We analyzed data from ten cancer cohorts to investigate the
      relationship between inferred TMB and sequencing depth. RESULTS: We found that
      TMB, estimated by counting the number of somatic mutations above a threshold
      frequency (typically 0.05), is not robust to sequencing depth. Furthermore, we
      show that, because only mutations with an observed frequency greater than the
      threshold are considered, the observed mutant allele frequency provides a biased 
      estimate of the true frequency. This can result in substantial over-estimation of
      the TMB, when the cancer sample includes a large number of somatic mutations at
      low frequencies, and exacerbates the lack of robustness of TMB to variation in
      sequencing depth and tumour purity. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that care
      needs to be taken in the estimation of TMB to ensure that results are unbiased
      and consistent across studies and we suggest that accurate and robust estimation 
      of TMB could be achieved using statistical models that estimate the full mutant
      allele frequency spectrum.

TI  - Targeted inhibition of ubiquitin signaling reverses metabolic reprogramming and
      suppresses glioblastoma growth.
PG  - 780
LID - 10.1038/s42003-022-03639-8 [doi]
AB  - Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most frequent and aggressive form of primary
      brain tumor in the adult population; its high recurrence rate and resistance to
      current therapeutics urgently demand a better therapy. Regulation of protein
      stability by the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) represents an important
      control mechanism of cell growth. UPS deregulation is mechanistically linked to
      the development and progression of a variety of human cancers, including GBM.
      Thus, the UPS represents a potentially valuable target for GBM treatment. Using
      an integrated approach that includes proteomics, transcriptomics and metabolic
      profiling, we identify praja2, a RING E3 ubiquitin ligase, as the key component
      of a signaling network that regulates GBM cell growth and metabolism. Praja2 is
      preferentially expressed in primary GBM lesions expressing the wild-type
      isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 gene (IDH1). Mechanistically, we found that praja2
      ubiquitylates and degrades the kinase suppressor of Ras 2 (KSR2). As a
      consequence, praja2 restrains the activity of downstream AMP-dependent protein
      kinase in GBM cells and attenuates the oxidative metabolism. Delivery in the
      brain of siRNA targeting praja2 by transferrin-targeted self-assembling
      nanoparticles (SANPs) prevented KSR2 degradation and inhibited GBM growth,
      reducing the size of the tumor and prolonging the survival rate of treated mice. 
      These data identify praja2 as an essential regulator of cancer cell metabolism,
      and as a potential therapeutic target to suppress GBM growth.

TI  - AMPK and NRF2: Interactive players in the same team for cellular homeostasis?

AB  - NRF2 (Nuclear factor E2 p45-related factor 2) is a stress responsive
      transcription factor lending cells resilience against oxidative, xenobiotic, and 
      also nutrient or proteotoxic insults. AMPK (AMP-activated kinase), considered as 
      prime regulator of cellular energy homeostasis, not only tunes metabolism to
      provide the cell at any time with sufficient ATP or building blocks, but also
      controls redox balance and inflammation. Due to observed overlapping cellular
      responses upon AMPK or NRF2 activation and common stressors impinging on both
      AMPK and NRF2 signaling, it is plausible to assume that AMPK and NRF2 signaling
      may interdepend and cooperate to readjust cellular homeostasis. After a short
      introduction of the two players this narrative review paints the current picture 
      on how AMPK and NRF2 signaling might interact on the molecular level, and
      highlights their possible crosstalk in selected examples of pathophysiology or
      bioactivity of drugs and phytochemicals.

TI  - Mussel-Inspired Clickable Antibacterial Peptide Coating on Ureteral Stents for
      Encrustation Prevention.
LID - 10.1021/acsami.2c09448 [doi]
AB  - Long-term indwelling catheters or stents often cause complications like
      infection, encrustation, hematuria, pain, and so on. The source of these problems
      is bacteria, which can form biofilms on the stents to reduce antibiotic
      sensitivity and produce urease to form encrustation by increasing the urine pH.
      Urinary tract infection (UTI) can aggravate the body damage and even seriously
      endanger lives, and the encrustation will block the stents, which can cause
      hydronephrosis and renal function damage. Therefore, the prevention of UTI and
      encrustation represents a great challenge in clinical ureteral stent uses. In
      this work, a clickable mussel-inspired peptide and antimicrobial peptide (AMP)
      were used to functionalize the commercial stents' surfaces to inhibit long-term
      infection and encrustation caused by bacteria. Copper (Cu) ions were used to
      coordinate the mussel-inspired peptide to improve the stability. The AMP with an 
      azido group was clicked to the mussel-inspired Cu-coordinated peptide coating
      through click chemistry. The bio-inspired antibacterial coating was constructed
      with excellent stability, bactericidal properties, and improved biological
      compatibility. In in vitro and in vivo experiments, it was further found that the
      coating showed bactericidal and encrustation reduction abilities. This study thus
      developed an effective, safe, and stable AMP coating on urinary stents/catheters 
      capable of long-term antibacterial and encrustation inhibition.

TI  - Francisella tularensis Exploits AMPK Activation to Harvest Host-Derived Nutrients
      Liberated from Host Lipolysis.
PG  - e0015522
LID - 10.1128/iai.00155-22 [doi]
AB  - Francisella tularensis is a zoonotic, facultative intracellular bacterial
      pathogen that replicates in a variety of cell types during infection. Following
      entry into the cell and phagosome escape, the bacterium replicates rapidly in the
      cytoplasm. F. tularensis intracellular growth depends on the availability of
      metabolizable essential nutrients to support replication. However, the mechanism 
      by which metabolizable nutrients become available to the bacterium in the
      intracellular environment is not fully understood. We found that F.
      tularensis-infected cells had significantly smaller and fewer lipid droplets than
      uninfected cells. Inhibition of triacylglycerol degradation significantly reduced
      bacterial growth, whereas inhibition of triacylglycerol formation did not reduce 
      bacterial growth, suggesting that triacylglycerols sequestered within lipid
      droplets are important nutrient sources for F. tularensis. We found that F.
      tularensis-infected cells had increased activation of lipolysis and the upstream 
      regulatory protein AMP protein kinase (AMPK). These data suggest that F.
      tularensis exploits AMPK activation and lipid metabolism to use host-derived
      nutrients. Finally, we found that AMPK activation is correlated with an increased
      bacterial burden, which suggests that it is a host-mediated response to nutrient 
      starvation that results from increased bacterial replication. Altogether, we
      conclude that F. tularensis exploits AMPK activation to access nutrients
      sequestered in lipid droplets, specifically glycerol and fatty acids, to undergo 
      efficient bacterial replication and cause successful infection.

AB  - AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a heterotrimeric complex, can sense energy
      and nutritional status in eukaryotic cells, thereby participating in the
      regulation of multiple cellular processes. In this study, we characterized the
      function of the catalytic alpha-subunit (SNF1) and the two regulatory beta- and
      gamma-subunits (GAL83 and SNF4) of AMPK in a representative nematode-trapping
      fungus, Arthrobotrys oligospora, by gene knockout, phenotypic analysis, and RNA
      sequencing. The ability of the AMPK complex mutants (including DeltaAosnf1,
      DeltaAogal83, and DeltaAosnf4) to utilize a nonfermentable carbon source
      (glycerol) was reduced, and the spore yields and trap formation were remarkably
      decreased. Moreover, AMPK plays an important role in regulating stress response
      and nematode predation efficiency. Transcriptomic profiling between the wild-type
      strain and DeltaAosnf1 showed that differentially expressed genes were enriched
      for peroxisome, endocytosis, fatty acid degradation, and multilipid metabolism
      (sphingolipid, ether lipid, glycerolipid, and glycerophospholipid). Meanwhile, a 
      reduced lipid droplet accumulation in DeltaAosnf1, DeltaAogal83, and DeltaAosnf4 
      mutants was observed, and more vacuoles appeared in the mycelia of the
      DeltaAosnf1 mutant. These results highlight the important regulatory role of AMPK
      in the utilization of carbon sources and lipid metabolism, as well as providing
      novel insights into the regulatory mechanisms of the mycelia development,
      conidiation, and trap formation of nematode-trapping (NT) fungi. IMPORTANCE NT
      fungi are widely distributed in various ecosystems and are important factors in
      the control of nematode populations in nature; their trophic mycelia can form
      unique infectious devices (traps) for capturing nematodes. Arthrobotrys
      oligospora is a representative NT fungi which can develop complex
      three-dimensional networks (adhesive networks) for nematode predation. Here, we
      demonstrated that AMPK plays an important role in the glycerol utilization,
      conidiation, trap formation, and nematode predation of A. oligospora, which was
      further confirmed by transcriptomic analysis of the wild-type and mutant strains.
      In particular, our analysis indicated that AMPK is required for lipid metabolism,
      which is primarily associated with energy regulation and is essential for trap
      formation. Therefore, this study extends the functional study of AMPK in NT fungi
      and helps to elucidate the molecular mechanism of the regulation of trap
      development, as well as laying the foundation for the development of efficient
      nematode biocontrol agents.

LID - 10.1039/d2cp02108k [doi]
AB  - The solid-state (1)H, (31)P NMR spectra and cross-polarization (CP MAS) kinetics 
      in the series of samples containing amorphous phosphate phase (AMP), composite of
      AMP + nano-structured calcium hydroxyapatite (nano-CaHA) and high-crystalline
      nano-CaHA were studied under moderate spinning rates (5-30 kHz). The combined
      analysis of the solid-state (1)H and (31)P NMR spectra provides the possibility
      to determine the hydration numbers of the components and the phase composition
      index. A broad set of spin dynamics models (isotropic/anisotropic,
      relaxing/non-relaxing, secular/semi-non-secular) was applied and fitted to the
      experimental CP MAS data. The anisotropic model with the angular averaging of
      dipolar coupling was applied for AMP and nano-CaHA for the first time. It was
      deduced that the spin diffusion in AMP is close to isotropic, whereas it is
      highly anisotropic in nano-CaHA being close to the Ising-type. This can be caused
      by the different number of internuclear interactions that must be explicitly
      considered in the spin system for AMP (I-S spin pair) and nano-CaHA (IN-S spin
      system with N >/= 2). The P-H distance in nano-CaHA was found to be significantly
      shorter than its crystallographic value. An underestimation can be caused by
      several factors, among those - proton conductivity via a large-amplitude motion
      of protons (O-H tumbling and the short-range diffusion) that occurs along OH(-)
      chains. The P-H distance deduced for AMP, i.e. the compound with HPO4(2-) as the 
      dominant structure, is fairly well matched to the crystallographic data. This
      means that the CP MAS kinetics is a capable technique to obtain complementary
      information on the proton localization in H-bonds and the proton transfer in the 
      cases where traditional structure determination methods fail.

TI  - Enhancement of BCAT2-Mediated Valine Catabolism Stimulates beta-Casein Synthesis 
      via the AMPK-mTOR Signaling Axis in Bovine Mammary Epithelial Cells.
LID - 10.1021/acs.jafc.2c03629 [doi]
AB  - Valine, a kind of branched-chain amino acid, plays a regulatory role beyond that 
      of a building block in milk protein synthesis. However, the underlying molecular 
      mechanism through which valine stimulates beta-casein synthesis has not been
      clarified. Therefore, our study aimed to evaluate the effect of valine on
      beta-casein synthesis and shed light into the molecular mechanism using an in
      vitro model. Results showed that valine supplementation significantly increased
      beta-casein synthesis in bovine mammary epithelial cells (BMECs). Meanwhile, the 
      supplementation of valine resulted in high levels of branched-chain
      aminotransferase transaminase 2 (BCAT2), TCA-cycle intermediate metabolites, and 
      ATP, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) inhibition, and mammalian target of
      rapamycin (mTOR) activation. Furthermore, the inhibition of BCAT2 decreased the
      beta-casein synthesis and downregulated the AMPK-mTOR pathway, with similar
      results observed for AMPK activation. Together, the present data indicate that
      valine promotes the synthesis of beta-casein by affecting the AMPK-mTOR signaling
      axis and that BCAT2-mediated valine catabolism is the key target.

TI  - Ellagic Acid Alters Muscle Fiber-Type Composition and Promotes Mitochondrial
      Biogenesis through the AMPK Signaling Pathway in Healthy Pigs.
LID - 10.1021/acs.jafc.2c04108 [doi]
AB  - Ellagic acid (EA), because of its remarkable health-promoting ability, has
      aroused widespread interest in the fields of nutrition and medicine. However, no 
      reports showed that EA regulates mitochondrial biogenesis as well as muscle
      fiber-type composition in pigs. Our study found that dietary 75 and 150 mg/kg EA 
      obviously augmented the slow myosin heavy chain (MyHC) protein level, the number 
      of slow-twitch muscle fibers, and the activity of malate dehydrogenase (MDH) in
      the longissimus thoracis (LT) muscle of growing-finishing pigs. In contrast,
      dietary 75 and 150 mg/kg EA decreased the fast MyHC level, the number of
      fast-twitch muscle fibers, and the activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the
      LT muscle. In addition, our further study found that dietary 75 and 150 mg/kg EA 
      promoted the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content, the mRNA expressions of ATP
      synthase (ATP5G), mtDNA transcription factor A (TFAM), AMP-activated protein
      kinase alpha1 (AMPKalpha1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma
      coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha) and sirtuin 1 (Sirt1), and the level of
      phospho-LKB1 (P-LKB1), phospho-AMPK (P-AMPK), Sirt1, and PGC-1alpha in the LT
      muscle. In vitro, 5, 10, and 20 mumol/L EA treatment upregulated the level of
      slow MyHC, but only 10 mumol/L EA treatment decreased fast MyHC protein
      expression in porcine skeletal muscle satellite cells (PSCs). In addition, our
      data again found that 10 mumol/L EA treatment promoted the mtDNA content, the
      mRNA levels of ATP5G, mitochondrial transcription factor b1 (TFB1M), citrate
      synthase (Cs), AMPKalpha1, PGC-1alpha, and Sirt1, and the protein expressions of 
      P-AMPK, P-LKB1, PGC-1alpha, and Sirt1 in PSCs. What is more, inhibition of the
      AMPK signaling pathway by AMPKalpha1 siRNA significantly eliminated the
      improvement of EA on muscle fiber-type composition as well as the mtDNA content
      in PSCs. In conclusion, EA altered muscle fiber-type composition and promoted
      mitochondrial biogenesis through the AMPK signaling pathway.

      With Disabilities.
PG  - e241
LID - 10.3346/jkms.2022.37.e241 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study investigated the demand for and awareness of a primary
      healthcare pilot project for people with disabilities; it also sought to identify
      relevant determinants for demand and awareness using Andersen's behavioral model 
      of health service use. METHODS: This study is a secondary analysis of data from
      the population-based survey conducted in Gyeonggi Regional Health &amp; Medical
      Center for People with Disabilities. The data was designed with quota random
      sampling based on the population with disabilities in each district (city [si]
      and county [gun]) across the Gyeonggi province (do) to evaluate the health and
      healthcare accessibility of the disabled people living in the Gyeonggi province. 
      The data was collected through the mobile-based survey of 1,140 people with
      disabilities living in Gyeonggi-do between March 2021 and June 2021. RESULTS:
      Awareness of the service (12.1%) was remarkably low, while the demand (80.5%) was
      high. The gap between respondents who needed the service but were unaware of it
      differed according to age, education, activities of daily living, health
      information sources, chronic disease, depression, subjective health status, and
      unmet healthcare needs. Chronic disease (odds ratio [OR], 1.86; P = 0.001) and an
      unmet need for medical care (OR, 2.30; P = 0.002) had significant influences on
      demand for the service. Furthermore, living alone (OR, 0.42; P = 0.023), medical 
      aid program beneficiary status (OR, 2.10; P = 0.020), access to health
      information from health service centers (OR, 4.00; P = 0.002), chronic disease
      (OR, 1.68; P = 0.043), severity of disability (OR, 1.78; P = 0.025), and
      subjective health status (OR, 4.51; P < 0.001) significantly affected awareness
      of the program. CONCLUSION: Chronic disease and an unmet need for medical care
      were key determinants of service demand, while the severity of disability was
      not. Thus, there is a need to review the initiative that defines service
      beneficiaries as people with severe disabilities. Policy makers should consider
      advertising programs to improve service awareness among people with disabilities.

TI  - In Silico and In Vitro Approach to Assess Direct Allosteric AMPK Activators from 
      Nature.
PG  - 794-804
LID - 10.1055/a-1797-3030 [doi]
AB  - The 5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an important
      metabolic regulator. Its allosteric drug and metabolite binding (ADaM) site was
      identified as an attractive target for direct AMPK activation and holds promise
      as a novel mechanism for the treatment of metabolic diseases. With the exception 
      of lusianthridin and salicylic acid, no natural product (NP) is reported so far
      to directly target the ADaM site. For the streamlined assessment of direct AMPK
      activators from the pool of NPs, an integrated workflow using in silico and in
      vitro methods was applied. Virtual screening combining a 3D shape-based approach 
      and docking identified 21 NPs and NP-like molecules that could potentially
      activate AMPK. The compounds were purchased and tested in an in vitro AMPK alpha 
      1 beta 1 gamma 1 kinase assay. Two NP-like virtual hits were identified, which,
      at 30 microM concentration, caused a 1.65-fold (+/- 0.24) and a 1.58-fold (+/-
      0.17) activation of AMPK, respectively. Intriguingly, using two different
      evaluation methods, we could not confirm the bioactivity of the supposed AMPK
      activator lusianthridin, which rebuts earlier reports.

AB  - Intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) is a chronic progressive condition mainly 
      caused by excessive inflammatory cytokines. Berberine (BBR) exerts
      anti-inflammatory effect on diseases and protective effect against IDD. However, 
      the mechanism is not uncertain. This study is aimed at investigating the
      molecular mechanism of BBR on IDD. Nucleus pulposus (NP) cells were treated with 
      BBR at different concentrations. The IDD rat model was established by
      acupuncture. The effect of BBR on interleukin- (IL-) 1beta-induced cell
      proliferation was measured by CCK-8 assay and BrdU staining. The role of BBR in
      IL-1beta-induced apoptosis, autophagy repression, and extracellular matrix (ECM) 
      degradation was measured by Annexin/PI staining, immunofluorescence, and
      immunoblot. The effect of BBR on IDD was investigated in rat. Our findings showed
      that BBR restored cell growth and attenuated apoptosis in IL-1beta-induced NP
      cells. BBR also prevented the IL-1beta-induced ECM degradation through regulating
      ECM-related enzymes and factors. Additionally, BBR significantly activated
      autophagy repressed by IL-1beta. Autophagy stimulated by BBR was diminished by
      the inhibition of the AMPK/mTOR/Ulk1 signaling pathway. In vivo study also showed
      BBR attenuated intervertebral disc degeneration. BBR could attenuate NP cells
      apoptosis and ECM degradation induced by IL-1beta through autophagy by the
      AMPK/mTOR/Ulk1 pathway. This study suggests BBR might function as an AMPK
      activator to alleviate IDD progression.

TI  - Vitamin C Sensitizes Pancreatic Cancer Cells to Erastin-Induced Ferroptosis by
      Activating the AMPK/Nrf2/HMOX1 Pathway.
PG  - 5361241
LID - 10.1155/2022/5361241 [doi]
AB  - Ferroptosis is a type of regulated cell death that displays a promising
      therapeutic pathway for drug-resistant tumor cells. However, some pancreatic
      cancer (PC) cells are less sensitive to erastin-induced ferroptosis, and normal
      pancreatic cells are susceptible to this newly discovered cell death. Therefore, 
      there is an urgent need to find drugs to enhance the sensitivity of these PC
      cells to erastin while limiting side effects. Here, we found that the oxidized
      form of vitamin C-dehydroascorbic acid (DHA) can be transported into PC cells
      expressing high levels of GLUT1, resulting in ferroptosis. Moreover,
      pharmacological vitamin C combined with erastin can synergistically induce
      ferroptosis of PC cells involving glutathione (GSH) reduction and ferrous iron
      accumulation while inhibiting the cytotoxicity of normal cells. Mechanistically, 
      as a direct system Xc(-) inhibitor, erastin can directly suppress the synthesis
      of GSH, and the recycling of vitamin C and DHA is performed through GSH
      consumption, which is denoted as the classical mode. Furthermore, oxidative
      stress induced by erastin and vitamin C could enhance the expression of HMOX1 via
      the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor
      2 (NRF2) pathway to increase the labile iron level, which is named the
      nonclassical mode. In vivo experiments showed that erastin and vitamin C can
      significantly slow tumor growth in PC xenografts. In summary, the combination of 
      erastin and vitamin C exerts a synergistic effect of classical and nonclassical
      modes to induce ferroptosis in PC cells, which may provide a promising
      therapeutic strategy for PC.

TI  - Diet-induced obesity impairs spermatogenesis: the critical role of NLRP3 in
      Sertoli cells.
PG  - 24
LID - 10.1186/s41232-022-00203-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence indicates a key role of Sertoli cell (SC)
      malfunction in spermatogenesis impairment induced by obesity. Nucleotide-binding 
      oligomerization domain-like receptor with a pyrin domain 3 (NLRP3) is expressed
      in SCs, but the role of NLRP3 in the pathological process of obesity-induced male
      infertility remains unclear. METHODS: NLRP3-deficient mice were fed a high-fat
      diet for 24 weeks to establish obesity-related spermatogenesis impairment. In
      another set of experiments, a lentiviral vector containing a microRNA (miR)-451
      inhibitor was injected into AMP-activated protein kinase alpha
      (AMPKalpha)-deficient mouse seminiferous tubules. Human testis samples were
      obtained by testicular puncture from men with obstructive azoospermia whose
      samples exhibited histologically normal spermatogenesis. Isolated human SCs were 
      treated with palmitic acid (PA) to mimic obesity model in vitro. RESULTS:
      Increased NLRP3 expression was observed in the testes of obese rodents. NLRP3 was
      also upregulated in PA-treated human SCs. NLRP3 deficiency attenuated
      obesity-related male infertility. SC-derived NLRP3 promoted interleukin-1beta
      (IL-1beta) secretion to impair testosterone synthesis and sperm performance and
      increased matrix metalloproteinase-8 (MMP-8) expression to degrade occludin via
      activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB). Increased miR-451 caused by
      obesity, decreased AMPKalpha expression and sequentially increased NADPH oxidase 
      activity were responsible for the activation of NLRP3. miR-451 inhibition
      protected against obesity-related male infertility, and these protective effects 
      were abolished by AMPKalpha deficiency in mice. CONCLUSIONS: NLRP3 promoted
      obesity-related spermatogenesis impairment. Increased miR-451 expression,
      impaired AMPKalpha pathway and the subsequent ROS production were responsible for
      NLRP3 activation. Our study provides new insight into the mechanisms underlying
      obesity-associated male infertility.

AB  - There is an urgent need in the medicinal fields to discover biocompatible
      nanoformulations with low cytotoxicity, which provide new strategies for
      promising therapies for several types of tumors. Bovine lactoperoxidase (LP) and 
      lactoferrin (LF) have recently attracted attention in medicine for their
      antitumor activities with recognized safety pattern. Both LP and LF are suitable 
      proteins to be coated or adsorbed to Cu and Fe nanometals for developing stable
      nanoformulations that boost immunity and strong anticancer effects. New
      nanometals of Cu and Fe NPs embedded in LP and LF forming novel nanocombinations 
      of LP-CNPs and LF-FNPs had a spherical shape with an average nanosize of about 21
      nm. The combination of LP-CNPs and LF-FNPs significantly exhibited the highest
      growth inhibitory efficacy, in terms of effectively lowering the half-maximal
      inhibitory concentration (IC50) values, against Caco-2, HepG2 and MCF7 cells
      comparing to nanometals, LP, LF and individual nanoproteins (LP-CNPs or LF-FNPs).
      The highest apoptotic effect of this nanocombination (LP-CNPs and LF-FNPs) was
      confirmed by the highest percentages of annexin-stained apoptotic cells and G0
      population with the strongest alteration in the expression of two
      well-characterized apoptosis guards (p53 and Bcl-2) and the maximum suppression
      in the proliferation marker (Ki-67). Also, the in silico analysis predicted that 
      LP-CNPs and LF-FNPs enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK, p53 activator)
      activity and inhibited cancer migration-related proteases (cathepsin B and matrix
      metalloproteinase (MMP)-9). Our results offer for the first time that these novel
      nanocombinations of LP and LF were superior in their selectivity and
      apoptosis-mediating anticancer activity to Cu and Fe nanometals as well as the
      free form of these proteins or their individual nanoforms.

      coordinating mitochondrial fission and mitophagy.

AB  - During the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in both mouse models and
      human patients, soluble forms of Amyloid-beta 1-42 oligomers (Abeta42o) trigger
      loss of excitatory synapses (synaptotoxicity) in cortical and hippocampal
      pyramidal neurons (PNs) prior to the formation of insoluble amyloid plaques. In a
      transgenic AD mouse model, we observed a spatially restricted structural
      remodeling of mitochondria in the apical tufts of CA1 PNs dendrites corresponding
      to the dendritic domain where the earliest synaptic loss is detected in vivo. We 
      also observed AMPK over-activation as well as increased fragmentation and loss of
      mitochondrial biomass in Ngn2-induced neurons derived from a new APP(Swe/Swe)
      knockin human ES cell line. We demonstrate that Abeta42o-dependent
      over-activation of the CAMKK2-AMPK kinase dyad mediates synaptic loss through
      coordinated phosphorylation of MFF-dependent mitochondrial fission and
      ULK2-dependent mitophagy. Our results uncover a unifying stress-response pathway 
      causally linking Abeta42o-dependent structural remodeling of dendritic
      mitochondria to synaptic loss.

AB  - Lung cancer is a leading cause of tumor-associated death worldwide. Autophagy
      plays a key role in regulating lung cancer progression, and is a promising option
      for lung cancer treatment. Saponins are a group of naturally occurring plant
      glycosides, characterized by their strong foam-forming properties in aqueous
      solution, and exert various biological properties, such as anti-inflammation and 
      anti-cancer. In the present study, we for the first time explored the effects of 
      gitogenin (GIT), an important saponin derived from Tribulus longipetalus, on lung
      cancer progression both in vitro and in vivo. We found that GIT markedly reduced 
      the proliferation and induced apoptosis in lung cancer cells through increasing
      the cleavage of Caspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs). In addition,
      GIT-incubated lung cancer cells exhibited clear accumulation of autophagosome,
      which was essential for GIT-suppressed lung cancer. Mechanistically, GIT-induced 
      autophagy initiation was mainly through activating AMP-activated protein kinase
      (AMPK) and blocking protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathways, respectively.
      Moreover, the autophagic flux was disrupted in GIT-treated lung cancer cells,
      contributing to the accumulation of impaired autophagolysosomes. Importantly, we 
      found that suppressing autophagy initiation could abolish GIT-induced cell death;
      however, autophagosomes accumulation sensitized lung cancer cells to cell death
      upon GIT treatment. More in vitro experiments showed that GIT led to reactive
      oxygen species (ROS) production in lung cancer cells, which was also involved in 
      the modulation of apoptosis. The in vivo findings confirmed the effects of GIT
      against lung cancer progression with undetectable toxicity to organs. In
      conclusion, we provided new insights into the treatment of lung cancer, and GIT
      might be an effective strategy for future clinical application.

TI  - Fic-mediated AMPylation tempers the unfolded protein response during
      physiological stress.
PG  - e2208317119
LID - 10.1073/pnas.2208317119 [doi]
AB  - The proper balance of synthesis, folding, modification, and degradation of
      proteins, also known as protein homeostasis, is vital to cellular health and
      function. The unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated when the mechanisms
      maintaining protein homeostasis in the endoplasmic reticulum become overwhelmed. 
      However, prolonged or strong UPR responses can result in elevated inflammation
      and cellular damage. Previously, we discovered that the enzyme filamentation
      induced by cyclic-AMP (Fic) can modulate the UPR response via posttranslational
      modification of binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP) by AMPylation during
      homeostasis and deAMPylation during stress. Loss of fic in Drosophila leads to
      vision defects and altered UPR activation in the fly eye. To investigate the
      importance of Fic-mediated AMPylation in a mammalian system, we generated a
      conditional null allele of Fic in mice and characterized the effect of Fic loss
      on the exocrine pancreas. Compared to controls, Fic(-/-) mice exhibit elevated
      serum markers for pancreatic dysfunction and display enhanced UPR signaling in
      the exocrine pancreas in response to physiological and pharmacological stress. In
      addition, both fic(-/-) flies and Fic(-/-) mice show reduced capacity to recover 
      from damage by stress that triggers the UPR. These findings show that
      Fic-mediated AMPylation acts as a molecular rheostat that is required to temper
      the UPR response in the mammalian pancreas during physiological stress. Based on 
      these findings, we propose that repeated physiological stress in differentiated
      tissues requires this rheostat for tissue resilience and continued function over 
      the lifetime of an animal.

AB  - Animals maintain the ability to survive and reproduce by acclimating to
      environmental temperatures. We showed here that Caenorhabditis elegans exhibited 
      temperature acclimation plasticity, which was regulated by a head-tail-head
      neural circuitry coupled with gut fat storage. After experiencing cold, C.
      elegans individuals memorized the experience and were prepared against subsequent
      cold stimuli. The cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element-binding 
      protein (CREB) regulated temperature acclimation in the ASJ thermosensory neurons
      and RMG head interneurons, where it modulated ASJ thermosensitivity in response
      to past cultivation temperature. The PVQ tail interneurons mediated the
      communication between ASJ and RMG via glutamatergic signaling. Temperature
      acclimation occurred via gut fat storage regulation by the triglyceride lipase
      ATGL-1, which was activated by a neuropeptide, FLP-7, downstream of CREB. Thus, a
      head-tail-head neural circuit coordinated with gut fat influenced
      experience-dependent temperature acclimation.

TI  - Microparticle Delivery of a STING Agonist Enables Indirect Activation of NK Cells
      by Antigen-Presenting Cells.
LID - 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.2c00207 [doi]
AB  - Natural killer (NK) cells are an important member of the innate immune system and
      can participate in direct tumor cell killing in response to immunotherapies. One 
      class of immunotherapy is stimulator of interferon gene (STING) agonists, which
      result in a robust type I interferon (IFN-I) response. Most mechanistic studies
      involving STING have focused on macrophages and T cells. Nevertheless, NK cells
      are also activated by IFN-I, but the effect of STING activation on NK cells
      remains to be adequately investigated. We show that both direct treatment with
      soluble STING agonist cyclic di-guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate
      (cGAMP) and indirect treatment with cGAMP encapsulated in microparticles (MPs)
      result in NK cell activation in vitro, although the former requires 100x more
      cGAMP than the latter. Additionally, direct activation with cGAMP leads to NK
      cell death. Indirect activation with cGAMP MPs does not result in NK cell death
      but rather cell activation and cell killing in vitro. In vivo, treatment with
      soluble cGAMP and cGAMP MPs both cause short-term activation, whereas only cGAMP 
      MP treatment produces long-term changes in NK cell activation markers. Thus, this
      work indicates that treatment with an encapsulated STING agonist activates NK
      cells more efficiently than that with soluble cGAMP. In both the in vitro and in 
      vivo systems, the MP delivery system results in more robust effects at a greatly 
      reduced dosage. These results have potential applications in aiding the
      improvement of cancer immunotherapies.

TI  - Extracellular histones induce inflammation and senescence of vascular smooth
      muscle cells by activating the AMPK/FOXO4 signaling pathway.
LID - 10.1007/s00011-022-01618-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sepsis is an abnormal immune-inflammatory response that is mainly
      caused by infection. It can lead to life-threatening organ dysfunction and death.
      Severely damaged tissue cells will release intracellular histones into the
      circulation as damage-related molecular patterns (DAMPs) to accelerate the
      systemic immune response. Although various histone-related cytotoxicity
      mechanisms have been explored, those that affect extracellular histones involved 
      in vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) dysfunction are yet to be determined.
      METHODS: Mouse aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were stimulated with
      different concentrations of histones, and cell viability was detected by CCK-8
      assay. Cellular senescence was assessed by SA beta-gal staining. C57BL/6 mice
      were treated with histones with or without BML-275 treatment. RT-qPCR was
      performed to determine the expression of inflammatory cytokines. Western blotting
      was used to analyze the expression of NLRP3, ASC and caspase-1 inflammasome
      proteins. The interaction of NLRP3 and ASC was detected by CoIP and
      immunofluorescence staining. RESULTS: In this study, we found that extracellular 
      histones induced senescence and inflammatory response in a dose-dependent manner 
      in cultured VSMCs. Histone treatment significantly promoted apoptosis-associated 
      speck-like protein containing CARD (ASC) as well as NACHT, LRR and PYD
      domains-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) interaction of inflammasomes in VSMCs.
      Forkhead box protein O4 (FOXO4), which is a downstream effector molecule of
      extracellular histones, was found to be involved in histone-regulated VSMC
      inflammatory response and senescence. Furthermore, the 5'-AMP-activated protein
      kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway was confirmed to mediate extracellular
      histone-induced FOXO4 expression, and blocking this signaling pathway with an
      inhibitor can suppress vascular inflammation induced by extracellular histones in
      vivo and in vitro. CONCLUSION: Extracellular histones induce inflammation and
      senescence in VSMCs, and blocking the AMPK/FOXO4 pathway is a potential target
      for the treatment of histonemediated organ injury.

AB  - Magnesium phosphates (MgP)s have attracted interest as an alternative biomaterial
      compared to the calcium phosphate (CaP)s compounds in the bone regeneration
      application in terms of their prominent biodegradability, lack of cytotoxicity,
      and ability of bone repair stimulation. Among them, amorphous magnesium
      phosphates (AMP)s indicated a higher rate of resorption, while preserving high
      osteoblasts viability and proliferation, which is comparable to their CaP peers. 
      However, fast degradation of AMP leads to the initial fast release of Mg(2+) ions
      and adverse effects on its excellent biological features. It seems that the
      addition of graphene oxide (GO) to magnesium phosphate can moderate its
      degradation rate. Hence, a novel in situ synthesized AMP powders containing 0.05,
      0.25, 0.5, and 1 wt% of graphene oxide (AMP/GO) were developed to achieve a
      favorable degradation rate, desirable antibacterial properties against both
      Escherichia coli (E. coli), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) accompanying with
      proper cell viability and proliferation. The incorporation of 0.5 wt% of graphene
      oxide into the AMP ceramic led to reduce the release of Mg(2+) ions from 571.2
      +/- 12.9 mg/L to 372.8 +/- 14.7 mg/L and P ions from 354.8 +/- 11.9 mg/L to 245.3
      +/- 9.9 mg/L, at day 10 of immersion in PBS. Besides, AMP/0.5 GO bioceramics were
      capable of eradicating all bacterial colonies of both strains. On the other hand,
      MG63 cells viability went up from 143.46% +/- 7.54 to 184.46% +/- 11.54 on the
      7th day of culture in the presence of 0.5 wt% of GO compared to pure AMP ceramic.
      Furthermore, alizarin red staining and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity
      demonstrated the ability of AMP/GO to maintain the osteogenic phenotype of MG63
      cells during 7 days culture. Therefore, it can be concluded that well distributed
      and in situ synthesized AMP/0.5GO powders can be a promising biomaterial for bone
      tissue regeneration.

TI  - Systemic Candida albicans Infection in Mice Causes Endogenous Endophthalmitis via
      Breaching the Outer Blood-Retinal Barrier.
PG  - e0165822
LID - 10.1128/spectrum.01658-22 [doi]
AB  - Candida albicans is the leading cause of endogenous fungal endophthalmitis;
      however, its pathobiology studies are limited. Moreover, the contribution of host
      factors in the pathogenesis of Candida endophthalmitis remains unclear. In the
      present study, we developed a murine model of C. albicans endogenous
      endophthalmitis and investigated the molecular pathobiology of ocular candidiasis
      and blood-retinal barrier permeability. Our data show that intravenous injection 
      of C. albicans in immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice led to endogenous endophthalmitis 
      without causing mortality, and C. albicans was detected in the eyes at 3 days
      postinfection and persisted for up to 10 days. The intraocular presence of C.
      albicans coincided with a decrease in retinal function and increased expression
      of inflammatory mediators (tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-alpha], interleukin
      1beta [IL-1beta], MIP2, and KC) and antimicrobial peptides (human beta-defensins 
      [hBDs] and LL37) in mouse retinal tissue. C. albicans infection disrupted the
      blood-retinal barrier (BRB) by decreasing the expression of tight junction (ZO-1)
      and adherens junction (E-cadherin, N/R-cadherin) proteins. In vitro studies using
      human retinal pigment epithelial (ARPE-19) cells showed time-dependent activation
      of eIF2alpha, extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK), and NF-kappaB signaling 
      and decreased activity of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) leading to the
      induction of an inflammatory response upon C. albicans infection. Moreover, C.
      albicans-infected cells exhibited increased cellular permeability coinciding with
      a reduction in cellular junction proteins. Overall, our study provides new
      insight into the molecular pathogenesis of C. albicans endogenous
      endophthalmitis. Furthermore, the experimental models developed in the study can 
      be used to identify newer therapeutic targets or test the efficacy of drugs to
      treat and prevent fungal endophthalmitis. IMPORTANCE Patients with candidemia
      often experience endophthalmitis, a blinding infectious eye disease. However, the
      pathogenesis of Candida endophthalmitis is not well understood. Here, using in
      vivo and in vitro experimental models, we describe events leading to the invasion
      of Candida into the eye. We show that Candida from the systemic circulation
      disrupts the protective blood-retinal barrier and causes endogenous
      endophthalmitis. Our study highlights an important role of retinal pigment
      epithelial cells in evoking innate inflammatory and antimicrobial responses
      toward C. albicans infection. This study allows a better understanding of the
      pathobiology of fungal endophthalmitis, which can lead to the discovery of novel 
      therapeutic targets to treat ocular fungal infections.

TI  - DHHC17 Is a New Regulator of AMPK Signaling.
PG  - e0013122
LID - 10.1128/mcb.00131-22 [doi]
AB  - The association of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) with membranes plays a
      critical role in the regulation of AMPK activation and function. Protein lipid
      modification, including palmitoylation, myristoylation, and farnesyation,
      constitutes a crucial mechanism in the regulation of protein dynamic interactions
      with membranes. Among the three subunits of the AMPK heterotrimeric complex, the 
      structural subunit AMPKbeta is myristoylated and the catalytic subunit AMPKalpha 
      is palmitoylated. Here, we report the characterization of AMPKalpha
      palmitoylation. We found that AMKPalpha was palmitoylated at Cys209 and Cys543,
      and this was required for AMPK activation and subcellular membrane
      compartmentalization. To understand the regulation of AMPKalpha palmitoylation,
      we have identified DHHC17 as a candidate palmitoyltransferase for AMPKalpha and
      found that DHHC17, by palmitoylating AMPKalpha, modulated AMPK membrane
      association and activation in response to energy stress. To determine the role of
      DHHC17 in cell function, we generated DHHC17 liver-specific knockout mice and
      found that inactivation of DHHC17 in the mouse liver impaired AMPK activation and
      hepatic autophagy and caused a type 2 diabetes-like syndrome. Overall, our
      studies demonstrate that AMPKalpha palmitoylation plays a critical role in AMPK
      activation and that DHHC17, through its modulation of AMPK signaling, constitutes
      a new regulator of hepatic metabolism.

TI  - Coordination variability reduced for soccer players compared to non-athletes
      during the stance phase of gait.
LID - 10.23736/S0022-4707.22.13964-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Soccer is a unilateral sports activity that may alter the
      spatiotemporal characteristics of gait. This may alter motor control of gait in
      the dominant leg in soccer players and lead to a sport-specific gait pattern,
      which has not yet been considered. We aimed to determine whether soccer players
      exhibit differences in the lower extremity coupling variability during gait
      compared to healthy non-athletes. METHODS: Hip, knee, and ankle joint angles from
      fourteen soccer players and sixteen controls were acquired during treadmill
      walking. Hip-knee coupling, knee-ankle coupling and coupling angle variability
      (CAV) of the right leg in the sagittal plane were assessed using a vector coding 
      technique. RESULTS: Soccer players showed reduced hip-knee CAV during the
      mid-stance and terminal-stance phases of gait compared to the control group (Padj
      = 0.04 and P < 0.001, respectively). In addition, soccer players less often used 
      an ankle coordination pattern, in which only the ankle joint but not the knee
      joint rotates (Padj = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In summary, soccer players show altered
      gait dynamics during normal walking, possibly due to intense soccer training.
      These changes provide evidence of adaptive strategies of the motor control system
      to sports activities that can be used for gait rehabilitation. Clinicians should 
      note that some sport, such as soccer, may result in sport-specific gait patterns 
      However, further works are needed to confirm this finding.

TI  - Grateful Patient Fundraising: Stories from Physicians.
PG  - 1-4
LID - 10.1353/nib.2022.0001 [doi]
AB  - This symposium includes 12 personal narratives from physicians who have been
      encouraged by their institutions to solicit donations from patients. This issue
      also includes three commentaries on these narratives by Stacey A. Tovino, Ceciel 
      Rooker &amp; Alyssa Sutton, and Richard Culbertson. This symposium presents a
      range of real life examples of how physicians and institutions navigate the
      ethical issues around fundraising from grateful patients paying particular
      attention to attempting to establish best practices to minimize any ethical
      conflicts. Some potential problem areas are also explored around transparency,
      real or perceived coercion and respect for boundaries.

TI  - Safety evaluation of enterococci isolated from raw milk and artisanal cheeses
      made in Slovenia and Serbia.

LID - 10.1177/10820132221117870 [doi]
AB  - Enterococci represent a significant part of the non-starter LAB microbiota of
      artisanal cheeses produced mainly from raw milk. Common approaches to safety
      evaluation of enterococci isolates include assessment of antimicrobial resistance
      and virulence potential. Hence, a collection of 47 (n = 22, Serbia; n = 25,
      Slovenia) dairy enterococcal isolates, of which E. faecalis (n = 28), E. faecium 
      (n = 11), E. durans (n = 5), E. casseliflavus (n = 2), and E. gallinarum (n = 1),
      was analyzed. The susceptibility to 12 antimicrobials was tested using a broth
      microdilution method, and the presence of the selected antimicrobial resistance
      and virulence genes was investigated using PCR. Isolates were resistant to
      tetracycline (TET) (25.5%), erythromycin (ERY) (17.0%), gentamycin and
      chloramphenicol (CHL) ( approximately 6%). No resistance to ampicillin (AMP),
      ciprofloxacin (CIP), daptomycin (DAP), linezolid (LZD), teicoplanin (TEI),
      tigecycline (TGC) and vancomycin (VAN) was detected. Among all the resistance
      determinants analyzed, ermB gene was detected most frequently. All 10 virulence
      genes analyzed were detected with a distribution of cpd (72.3%), cob and ccf
      (70.2%), gelE (68.1%), hyl (59.6%), agg (53.2%) and esp (46.8%). The genes
      encoding cytolysin (cylA, cylM and cylB) were amplified to a lesser extent
      (21.3%, 21.3% and 12.8%, respectively). However, due to the limited number of
      enterococci isolates analyzed in the present study, further studies are still
      required in order to better document the safety status of dairy enterococci.

TI  - Clinical and laboratory features in women with different phenotypes of polycystic
      ovary syndrome.
LID - 10.23736/S2724-606X.22.05124-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Misdiagnosis is still an obstacle in the workup of polycystic ovary
      syndrome. We compared patients' characteristics among phenotypes of the syndrome 
      and assessed the association of the characteristics with oligo-anovulation,
      hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovary. METHODS: In the infertility department of
      a teaching hospital, we performed a cross-sectional study. Based on the Rotterdam
      criteria, we included 136 patients with polycystic ovary syndrome and 46 healthy 
      controls. RESULTS: The most common phenotype was A (N=45;33%). Overall, A and C
      had larger body mass index (P=0.019 and 0.030, respectively) and waist
      circumference (P=0.005 and 0.003) than control. Also, A and D had higher serum
      anti-mullerian hormone than control (both P<0.001) or phenotype C (P<0.001 and
      =0.01). Phenotypes A and C had higher insulin than control (both P=0.004). The
      highest level of estradiol was for control and the lowest for B. The lowest
      high-density lipoprotein was for C; and A to C phenotypes had higher triglyceride
      than control (P=0.002, <0.001, and =0.041). Larger body mass was associated with 
      hyperandrogenism [adjusted odds ratio (95% CI) =1.11(1.01, 1.23), P=0.034];
      higher anti-mullerian hormone and high-density lipoprotein were related to
      oligo-anovulation [1.2(1.07,1.37), P=0.004; 1.1(1.00,1.13), P=0.041]. Higher
      insulin and lower high-density lipoprotein were associated with polycystic ovary 
      [1.11(1.03,1.21), P=0.013; 0.9(0.82,0.97), P=0.014]. CONCLUSIONS: There are
      potentials in body mass index, waist circumference, serum anti-mullerian hormone,
      insulin, estradiol, high-density lipoprotein, and triglyceride concentration for 
      differentiating the phenotypes of polycystic ovary syndrome and for more precise 
      diagnosis of hyperandrogenism, oligo-anovulation, and polycystic ovary
      morphology.

TI  - Hydrogen Sulfide Ameliorated High Choline-Induced Cardiac Dysfunction by
      Inhibiting cGAS-STING-NLRP3 Inflammasome Pathway.
PG  - 1392896
LID - 10.1155/2022/1392896 [doi]
AB  - Although it is an essential nutrient, high choline intake directly or indirectly 
      via its metabolite is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease,
      the mechanism of which remains to be elucidated. The present study was performed 
      to investigate whether hydrogen sulfide (H2S) was involved in high
      choline-induced cardiac dysfunction and explore the potential mechanisms. We
      found that ejection fraction (EF) and fractional shortening (FS), the indicators 
      of cardiac function measured by echocardiography, were significantly decreased in
      mice fed a diet containing 1.3% choline for 4 months as compared to the control, 
      while applying 3,3-dimethyl-1-butanol (DMB) to suppress trimethylamine N-oxide
      (TMAO, a metabolite of choline) generation ameliorated the cardiac function.
      Subsequently, we found that feeding choline or TMAO significantly increased the
      protein levels of cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS), stimulator of
      interferon genes (STING), NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3), caspase-1, and
      interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) as compared to the control, which indicated the
      activation of cGAS-STING-NLRP3 inflammasome axis. Moreover, the protein
      expression of cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE), the main enzyme for H2S production
      in the cardiovascular system, was significantly increased after dietary
      supplementation with choline, but the plasma H2S levels were significantly
      decreased. To observe the effect of endogenous H2S, CSE knockout (KO) mice were
      used, and we found that the EF, FS, and plasma H2S levels in WT mice were
      significantly decreased after dietary supplementation with choline, while there
      was no difference between CSE KO + control and CSE KO + choline group. To observe
      the effect of exogenous H2S, mice were intraperitoneally injected with sodium
      hydrosulfide (NaHS, a H2S donor) for 4 months, and we found that NaHS improved
      the cardiac function and reduced the protein levels of cGAS, STING, NLRP3,
      caspase-1, and IL-1beta in mice receiving dietary choline. In conclusion, our
      studies revealed that high choline diet decreased plasma H2S levels and induced
      cardiac dysfunction via cGAS-STING-NLRP3 inflammasome axis while H2S treatment
      could restore the cardiac function by inhibiting cGAS-STING-NLRP3 inflammasome
      axis.

AB  - Introduction: Rewarming from accidental hypothermia is often complicated by
      hypothermia-induced cardiovascular dysfunction, which could lead to shock.
      Current guidelines do not recommend any pharmacological treatment at core
      temperatures below 30 degrees C, due to lack of knowledge. However, previous in
      vivo studies have shown promising results when using phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE3)
      inhibitors, which possess the combined effects of supporting cardiac function and
      alleviating the peripheral vascular resistance through changes in cyclic
      nucleotide levels. This study therefore aims to investigate whether PDE3
      inhibitors milrinone, amrinone, and levosimendan are able to modulate cyclic
      nucleotide regulation in hypothermic settings. Materials and methods: The effect 
      of PDE3 inhibitors were studied by using recombinant phosphodiesterase enzymes
      and inverted erythrocyte membranes at six different temperatures-37 degrees C, 34
      degrees C, 32 degrees C, 28 degrees C, 24 degrees C, and 20 degrees C- in order
      to evaluate the degree of enzymatic degradation, as well as measuring cellular
      efflux of both cAMP and cGMP. The resulting dose-response curves at every
      temperature were used to calculate IC50 and Ki values. Results: Milrinone IC50
      and Ki values for cGMP efflux were significantly lower at 24 degrees C (IC50:
      8.62 +/- 2.69 microM) and 20 degrees C (IC50: 7.35 +/- 3.51 microM), compared to 
      37 degrees C (IC50: 22.84 +/- 1.52 microM). There were no significant changes in 
      IC50 and Ki values for enzymatic breakdown of cAMP and cGMP. Conclusion:
      Milrinone, amrinone and levosimendan, were all able to suppress enzymatic
      degradation and inhibit extrusion of cGMP and cAMP below 30 degrees C. Our
      results show that these drugs have preserved effect on their target molecules
      during hypothermia, indicating that they could provide an important treatment
      option for hypothermia-induced cardiac dysfunction.

AB  - Vascular diseases affect the circulatory system and comprise most human diseases.
      They cause severe symptoms and affect the quality of life of patients. Recently, 
      since their identification, exchange proteins directly activated by cAMP (Epac)
      have attracted increasing scientific interest, because of their role in cyclic
      adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signaling, a well-known signal transduction
      pathway. The role of Epac in cardiovascular disease and cancer is extensively
      studied, whereas their role in kidney disease has not been comprehensively
      explored yet. In this study, we aimed to review recent studies on the regulatory 
      effects of Epac on various vascular diseases, such as cardiovascular disease,
      cerebrovascular disease, and cancer. Accumulating evidence has shown that both
      Epac1 and Epac2 play important roles in vascular diseases under both
      physiological and pathological conditions. Additionally, there has been an
      increasing focus on Epac pharmacological modulators. Therefore, we speculated
      that Epac could serve as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of vascular
      diseases.

AB  - Aim: To develop an extraction protocol and determine stability for antimicrobial 
      peptide (AMP) Kn2-7 and its d-enantiomer dKn2-7 in human serum. Materials &
      methods: We compared use of ethanol, acetonitrile, RapiGest SF Surfactant and 1% 
      formic acid in ethanol for AMP recovery from serum prior to liquid
      chromatography-mass spectrometry quantification. Results: Precipitation of
      samples with 1% formic acid in ethanol caused the least amount of AMP loss during
      extraction from serum. Time-course experiments revealed dKn2-7 was significantly 
      more stable than Kn2-7 in 25% serum, with 78.5% of dKn2-7 and only 1.0% of Kn2-7 
      remaining after 24 h at 37 degrees C. Conclusion: The optimized method
      significantly increased peptide recovery and allowed more accurate and consistent
      quantification of Kn2-7 and dKn2-7 serum stability.

TI  - Extracellular Nicotinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase Is a Component of the
      Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype.
PG  - 935106
LID - 10.3389/fendo.2022.935106 [doi]
AB  - Cellular senescence is a stress or damage response by which a cell adopts of
      state of essentially permanent proliferative arrest, coupled to the secretion of 
      a number of biologically active molecules. This senescence-associated secretory
      phenotype (SASP) underlies many of the degenerative and regenerative aspects of
      cellular senescence - including promoting wound healing and development, but also
      driving diabetes and multiple age-associated diseases. We find that nicotinamide 
      phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in
      nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) biosynthesis, is elevated in senescent
      cells without a commensurate increase in NAD levels. This elevation is distinct
      from the acute DNA damage response, in which NAD is depleted, and recovery of NAD
      by NAMPT elevation is AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent. Instead, we
      find that senescent cells release extracellular NAMPT (eNAMPT) as part of the
      SASP. eNAMPT has been reported to be released as a catalytically active
      extracellular vesicle-contained dimer that promotes NAD increases in other cells 
      and extends lifespan, and also as free monomer that acts as a damage-associated
      molecular pattern and promotes conditions such as diabetes and fibrosis.
      Senescent cells released eNAMPT as dimer, but surprisingly eNAMPT appeared in the
      soluble secretome while being depleted from exosomes. Finally, diabetic mice
      showed elevated levels of eNAMPT, and this was lowered by treatment with the
      senolytic drug, ABT-263. Together, these data reveal a new SASP factor with
      implications for NAD metabolism.

TI  - Pharmacological Targeting of Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition in Colorectal
      Cancer.
LID - 10.2174/1381612828666220728152350 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cause of cancer
      deaths, and metastasis is a major cause of mortalities. The survival rate of
      patients diagnosed with metastasis remains disappointing. Therefore, the
      prevention of tumor dissemination as well as treatment of existing metastatic
      lesions is an important focus of new cancer therapies. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal 
      transition (EMT) is defined as a cellular transition from an epithelial to a
      mesenchymal state and determines cancer lethal characteristics consisting of
      invasiveness, metastasis formation, and drug resistance. METHODS: We reviewed
      PubMed and EMBASE libraries to gather data about pharmacological targeting of
      Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition in colorectal cancer to prevent the tumor
      metastatic distribution and improve survival of patients with CRC. RESULT: We
      provided an overview of the available EMT-based therapies in CRC, summarized
      FDA-approved and under-clinical trial drugs with EMT-inhibiting property in
      metastatic CRC, and described several agents preventing EMT-associated
      progression and metastasis in preclinical studies. Although various preclinical
      and clinical findings have proven that inhibiting EMT via different
      pharmacological approaches can reduce aggressive features of many cancers, not
      all agents possessing EMT-inhibiting function in preclinical research exhibit
      improvement in clinical studies. CONCLUSION: Combating EMT as a therapeutic
      intervention with the aim of preventing tumor dissemination, eliminating exiting 
      metastasis, and promoting resistance to therapy may be a novel and effective
      strategy in the treatment of CRC. Our hope is that further exploration about
      EMT-related mechanisms and EMT-inhibiting drugs provide more opportunities for us
      to treat CRC efficiently.

TI  - Cardiomyocyte-specific knockout of ADAM17 ameliorates left ventricular remodeling
      and function in diabetic cardiomyopathy of mice.
PG  - 259
LID - 10.1038/s41392-022-01054-3 [doi]
AB  - Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has proven beneficial in attenuating
      diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) but has been found to be a substrate of a
      disintegrin and metalloprotease protein-17 (ADAM17). However, whether ADAM17
      plays a role in the pathogenesis and intervention of DCM is obscure. In this
      study, we created cardiomyocyte-specific knockout of ADAM17 (A17(alpha-MHCKO))
      mice, and left ventricular dimension, function, pathology and molecular biology
      were assessed in ADAM17(fl/fl) control, A17(alpha-MHCKO) control, ADAM17(fl/fl)
      diabetic and A17(alpha-MHCKO) diabetic mice. Both differentiated H9c2 cells and
      neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs) were used to explore the molecular mechanisms
      underlying the effect of ADAM17 on DCM. The results showed that protein
      expression and activity of ADAM17 were upregulated whereas the protein expression
      of ACE2 was downregulated in the myocardium of diabetic mice.
      Cardiomyocyte-specific knockout of ADAM17 mitigated cardiac fibrosis and
      cardiomyocyte apoptosis and ameliorated cardiac dysfunction in mice with DCM.
      Bioinformatic analyses detected a number of genes enriched in metabolic pathways,
      in particular the AMPK signaling pathway, expressed differentially between the
      hearts of A17(alpha-MHCKO) and ADAM17(fl/fl) diabetic mice. The mechanism may
      involve activated AMPK pathway, increased autophagosome formation and improved
      autophagic flux, which reduced the apoptotic response in cardiomyocytes. In
      addition, hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) might act as an upstream
      mediator of upregulated ADAM17 and ADAM17 might affect AMPK signaling via alpha1 
      A-adrenergic receptor (ADRA1A). These results indicated that ADAM17 activity and 
      ACE2 shedding were enhanced in DCM, which was reversed by cardiomyocyte-specific 
      ADAM17 knockout. Thus, inhibition of ADAM17 may provide a promising approach to
      the treatment of DCM.

TI  - Decreased expression of GRIM-19 induces autophagy through the AMPK/ULK1 signaling
      pathway during adenomyosis.
LID - ioac151 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/biolre/ioac151 [doi]
AB  - The processes underlying adenomyosis are similar to those of tumor metastasis,
      and it is defined as progressive invasion by the endometrium and the subsequent
      creation of ectopic lesions. GRIM-19 regulates cell death via the mitochondrial
      respiratory chain. Stress following oxygen deprivation can induce tumor cell
      autophagy, leading to cell invasion and migration. Here, we revealed that GRIM-19
      negatively regulates autophagy, and, at least in adenomyosis, decreased
      expression of GRIM-19 is accompanied by an increased level of autophagy and
      5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase-Unc-51 like autophagy
      activating kinase 1 (AMPK-ULK1) activation. Upregulation of GRIM-19 expression in
      human primary endometrial cells and ISHIKAWA cells inhibits autophagy via the
      AMPK-ULK1 pathway and helps control cell invasion and migration. In addition, we 
      also identified increased expression of AMPK and ULK1, and higher levels of
      autophagy in the uterine tissues of GRIM-19+/- mice. Importantly, the function of
      the GRIM-19-AMPK-ULK1 axis in regulating autophagy in adenomyosis is similar to
      that of tumor tissues, which may help elucidate the regulation of adenomyosis
      tumor-like behavior, and is expected to help identify novel targets for the
      diagnosis and treatment of adenomyosis.

TI  - Ym155 localizes to the mitochondria leading to mitochondria dysfunction and
      activation of AMPK that inhibits BMP signaling in lung cancer cells.
PG  - 13135
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-17446-y [doi]
AB  - The imidazolium compound Ym155 was first reported to be a survivin inhibitor.
      Ym155 potently induces cell death of many types of cancer cells in preclinical
      studies. However, in phase II clinical trials Ym155 failed to demonstrate a
      significant benefit. Studies have suggested that the cytotoxic effects of Ym155
      in cancer cells are not mediated by the inhibition of survivin. Understanding the
      mechanism by which Ym155 induces cell death would provide important insight how
      to improve its efficacy as a cancer therapeutic. We demonstrate a novel mechanism
      by which Ym155 induces cell death by localizing to the mitochondria causing
      mitochondrial dysfunction. Our studies suggest that Ym155 binds mitochondrial DNA
      leading to a decrease in oxidative phosphorylation, decrease in TCA cycle
      intermediates, and an increase in mitochondrial permeability. Furthermore, we
      show that mitochondrial stress induced by Ym155 and other mitochondrial
      inhibitors activates AMP-activated kinase leading to the downregulation to bone
      morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling. We provide first evidence that Ym155
      initiates cell death by disrupting mitochondrial function.

AB  - The International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium
      (ISARIC) COVID-19 dataset is one of the largest international databases of
      prospectively collected clinical data on people hospitalized with COVID-19. This 
      dataset was compiled during the COVID-19 pandemic by a network of hospitals that 
      collect data using the ISARIC-World Health Organization Clinical Characterization
      Protocol and data tools. The database includes data from more than 705,000
      patients, collected in more than 60 countries and 1,500 centres worldwide.
      Patient data are available from acute hospital admissions with COVID-19 and
      outpatient follow-ups. The data include signs and symptoms, pre-existing
      comorbidities, vital signs, chronic and acute treatments, complications, dates of
      hospitalization and discharge, mortality, viral strains, vaccination status, and 
      other data. Here, we present the dataset characteristics, explain its
      architecture and how to gain access, and provide tools to facilitate its use.

AB  - In this study, we probe the role of secondary messenger c-di-AMP in drug
      tolerance, which includes both persister and resistant mutant characterization of
      Mycobacterium smegmatis. Specifically, with the use of c-di-AMP null and
      overproducing mutants, we showed how c-di-AMP plays a significant role in
      resistance mutagenesis against antibiotics with different mechanisms of action.
      We elucidated the specific molecular mechanism linking the elevated intracellular
      c-di-AMP level and high mutant generation and highlighted the significance of
      non-homology-based DNA repair. Further investigation enabled us to identify the
      unique mutational landscape of target and non-target mutation categories linked
      to intracellular c-di-AMP levels. Overall fitness cost of unique target mutations
      was estimated in different strain backgrounds, and then we showed the critical
      role of c-di-AMP in driving epistatic interactions between resistance genes,
      resulting in the evolution of multi-drug tolerance. Finally, we identified the
      role of c-di-AMP in persister cells regrowth and mutant enrichment upon cessation
      of antibiotic treatment.

TI  - Single cell transcriptome sequencing of inspiratory neurons of the preBotzinger
      complex in neonatal mice.
PG  - 457
LID - 10.1038/s41597-022-01569-y [doi]
AB  - Neurons in the brainstem preBotzinger complex (preBotC) generate the rhythm and
      rudimentary motor pattern for inspiratory breathing movements. We performed
      whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from inspiratory neurons in the preBotC of
      neonatal mouse slices that retain breathing-related rhythmicity in vitro. We
      classified neurons based on their electrophysiological properties and genetic
      background, and then aspirated their cellular contents for single-cell RNA
      sequencing (scRNA-seq). This data set provides the raw nucleotide sequences
      (FASTQ files) and annotated files of nucleotide sequences mapped to the mouse
      genome (mm10 from Ensembl), which includes the fragment counts, gene lengths, and
      fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM). These data 
      reflect the transcriptomes of the neurons that generate the rhythm and pattern
      for inspiratory breathing movements.

TI  - Reducing VEGFB accelerates NAFLD and insulin resistance in mice via inhibiting
      AMPK signaling pathway.
PG  - 341
LID - 10.1186/s12967-022-03540-2 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Vascular endothelial growth factor B (VEGFB) was regarded to improve
      lipid metabolism and reduce obesity-related hyperlipidemia. Whether VEGFB
      participates in lipid metabolism in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has 
      not been clear yet. This study investigated the involvement of VEGFB in lipid
      metabolism and insulin resistance via the AMPK signaling pathway in NAFLD.
      METHODS: We constructed the animal and cell model of NAFLD after VEGFB gene
      knockout to detect liver damage and metabolism in NAFLD. Bioinformatics analysis 
      of VEGFB and the AMPK signaling pathway relative genes to verify the differential
      proteins. And mRNA levels of NAFLD fatty acid metabolism-related genes were
      detected. RESULTS: After the systemic VEGFB knockout mice were fed with high fat,
      the body fat, serum lipoprotein, NAFLD score, and insulin resistance were
      increased. Animal and cell experiments showed that the expression levels of
      phosphorylated proteins of CaMKK2 and AMPK decreased, the expression of proteins 
      related to AMPK/ACC/CPT1 signaling pathway decreased, and the target genes
      CPT1alpha and Lcad decreased accordingly, reducing fatty acid oxidation in
      hepatocyte mitochondria; The expression of AMPK/SREBP1/Scd1 signaling pathway
      relative proteins increased, ACC1 and FAS increased correspondingly, which
      increased lipid synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum. CONCLUSION: VEGFB can
      participate in lipid metabolism and insulin resistance of NAFLD through the AMPK 
      signaling pathway.

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are currently the most common cause of morbidity
      and mortality worldwide. Experimental studies suggest that liver kinase B1 (LKB1)
      plays an important role in the heart. Several studies have shown that
      cardiomyocyte-specific LKB1 deletion leads to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, left
      ventricular contractile dysfunction, and an increased risk of atrial
      fibrillation. In addition, the cardioprotective effects of several medicines and 
      natural compounds, including metformin, empagliflozin, bexarotene, and
      resveratrol, have been reported to be associated with LKB1 activity. LKB1 limits 
      the size of the damaged myocardial area by modifying cellular metabolism,
      enhancing the antioxidant system, suppressing hypertrophic signals, and inducing 
      mild autophagy, which are all primarily mediated by the AMP-activated protein
      kinase (AMPK) energy sensor. LKB1 also improves myocardial efficiency by
      modulating the function of contractile proteins, regulating the expression of
      electrical channels, and increasing vascular dilatation. Considering these
      properties, stimulation of LKB1 signaling offers a promising approach in the
      prevention and treatment of heart diseases.

AB  - Inhibition of the NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE), the key E1 enzyme in the
      neddylation cascade, has been considered an attractive anticancer strategy with
      the discovery of the first-in-class NAE inhibitor, MLN4924. In this study, we
      identified SOMCL-19-133 as a highly potent, selective, and orally available NAE
      inhibitor, which is an analog to AMP. It effectively inhibited NAE with an IC50
      value of 0.36 nM and exhibited more than 2855-fold selectivity over the closely
      related Ubiquitin-activating enzyme (UAE). It is worth noting that treatment with
      SOMCL-19-133 prominently inhibited Cullin neddylation and delayed the turnover of
      a panel of Cullin-RING ligases (CRLs) substrates (e.g., Cdt1, p21, p27, and Wee1)
      at lower effective concentrations than that of MLN4924, subsequently caused DNA
      damage and Chk1/Chk2 activation, and thus triggered cell cycle arrest and
      apoptosis. Moreover, SOMCL-19-133 exhibited potent antiproliferative activity
      against a broad range of human tumor cell lines (mean IC50 201.11 nM), which was 
      about 5.31-fold more potent than that of MLN4924. In vivo, oral delivery
      treatments with SOMCL-19-133, as well as the subcutaneous injection, led to
      significant tumor regression in mouse xenograft models. All of the treatments
      were well tolerated on a continuous daily dosing schedule. Compared with MLN4924,
      SOMCL-19-133 had a 5-fold higher peak plasma concentration, lower plasma
      clearance, and a 4-fold larger area under the curve (AUClast). In conclusion,
      SOMCL-19-133 is a promising preclinical candidate for treating cancers owing to
      its profound in vitro and in vivo efficacy and favorable pharmacokinetic
      properties.

TI  - Unlocking the access to oxidized coenzyme A via a single-step green
      membrane-based purification.

AB  - A new membrane-based strategy to purify oxidized coenzyme A ((CoAS)2) from
      adenosine triphosphate (ATP), adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and adenosine
      monophosphate (AMP) has been developed. Commercially available membranes were
      screened and studied (permeate flux and overall compounds retention) which
      allowed the identification of one efficient membrane (GK from Suez Water
      Technologies & Solutions). Different total compounds concentrations solutions
      were used in the system in order to find the following working conditions: 4 bars
      with a total compounds solution of 5.19 g L(-1). Applying these conditions to a
      dia-filtration set-up allowed us to reach 68% pure (CoAS)2 in 4.8 diafiltration
      volumes (DV) and a 95% (CoAS)2 purity can be predicted in 8.5 DV. A comparative
      study of green metrics-i.e. process mass index (PMI)-of the classic
      chromatography vs the membrane-based one demonstrated the great advantages of the
      latter in terms of sustainability. This strategy unlocks the access to the
      essential and central cofactor that is coenzyme A.

AB  - Glioblastoma is the most common aggressive adult brain tumor. Numerous studies
      have reported results from either private institutional data or publicly
      available datasets. However, current public datasets are limited in terms of: a) 
      number of subjects, b) lack of consistent acquisition protocol, c) data quality, 
      or d) accompanying clinical, demographic, and molecular information. Toward
      alleviating these limitations, we contribute the "University of Pennsylvania
      Glioblastoma Imaging, Genomics, and Radiomics" (UPenn-GBM) dataset, which
      describes the currently largest publicly available comprehensive collection of
      630 patients diagnosed with de novo glioblastoma. The UPenn-GBM dataset includes 
      (a) advanced multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging scans acquired during
      routine clinical practice, at the University of Pennsylvania Health System, (b)
      accompanying clinical, demographic, and molecular information, (d) perfusion and 
      diffusion derivative volumes, (e) computationally-derived and manually-revised
      expert annotations of tumor sub-regions, as well as (f) quantitative imaging
      (also known as radiomic) features corresponding to each of these regions. This
      collection describes our contribution towards repeatable, reproducible, and
      comparative quantitative studies leading to new predictive, prognostic, and
      diagnostic assessments.

TI  - Xiaoyao San, a Chinese herbal formula, ameliorates depression-like behavior in
      mice through the AdipoR1/AMPK/ACC pathway in hypothalamus.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Depression and metabolic disorders have overlapping psychosocial and
      pathophysiological causes. Current research is focused on the possible role of
      adiponectin in regulating common biological mechanisms. Xiaoyao San (XYS), a
      classic Chinese medicine compound, has been widely used in the treatment of
      depression and can alleviate metabolic disorders such as lipid or glucose
      metabolism disorders. However, the ability of XYS to ameliorate depression-like
      behavior as well as metabolic dysfunction in mice and the underlying mechanisms
      are unclear. METHODS: An in vivo animal model of depression was established by
      chronic social defeat stress (CSDS). XYS and fluoxetine were administered by
      gavage to the drug intervention group. Depression-like behaviors were analyzed by
      the social interaction test, open field test, forced swim test, and elevated plus
      maze test. Glucose levels were measured using the oral glucose tolerance test.
      The involvement of certain molecules was validated by immunofluorescence,
      histopathology, and Western blotting. In vitro, hypothalamic primary neurons were
      exposed to high glucose to induce neuronal damage, and the neuroprotective effect
      of XYS was evaluated by cell counting kit-8 assay. Immunofluorescence and Western
      blotting were used to evaluate the influences of XYS on adiponectin receptor 1
      (AdipoR1), adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK),
      acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC) and other related proteins. RESULTS: XYS
      ameliorated CSDS-induced depression-like behaviors and glucose tolerance
      impairment in mice and increased the level of serum adiponectin. XYS also
      restored Nissl bodies in hypothalamic neurons in mice that exhibited
      depression-like behaviors and decreased the degree of neuronal morphological
      damage. In vivo and in vitro studies indicated that XYS increased the expression 
      of AdipoR1 in hypothalamic neurons. CONCLUSION: Adiponectin may be a key
      regulator linking depression and metabolic disorders; regulation of the
      hypothalamic AdipoR1/AMPK/ACC pathway plays an important role in treatment of
      depression by XYS.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial peptides, natural or synthetic, appear as promising
      molecules for antimicrobial therapy because of their both broad antimicrobial
      activity and mechanism of action. Herein, we determine the anti-Candida and
      antimycobacterial activities, mechanism of action on yeasts, and cytotoxicity on 
      mammalian cells in the presence of the bioinspired peptide CaDef2.1G27-K44.
      METHODS: CaDef2.1G27-K44 was designed to attain the following criteria: high
      positive net charge; low molecular weight (<3000 Da); Boman index </=2.5; and
      total hydrophobic ratio >/= 40%. The mechanism of action was studied by growth
      inhibition, plasma membrane permeabilization, ROS induction, mitochondrial
      functionality, and metacaspase activity assays. The cytotoxicity on macrophages, 
      monocytes, and erythrocytes were also determined. RESULTS: CaDef2.1G27-K44 showed
      inhibitory activity against Candida spp. with MIC100 values ranging from 25 to 50
      muM and the standard and clinical isolate of Mycobacterium tuberculosis with
      MIC50 of 33.2 and 55.4 muM, respectively. We demonstrate that CaDef2.1G27-K44 is 
      active against yeasts at different salt concentrations, induced morphological
      alterations, caused membrane permeabilization, increased ROS, causes loss of
      mitochondrial functionality, and activation of metacaspases. CaDef2.1G27-K44 has 
      low cytotoxicity against mammalian cells. CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained
      showed that CaDef2.1G27-K44 has great antimicrobial activity against Candida spp.
      and M. tuberculosis with low toxicity to host cells. For Candida spp., the
      treatment with CaDef2.1G27-K44 induces a process of regulated cell death with
      apoptosis-like features. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: We show a new AMP bioinspired with
      physicochemical characteristics important for selectivity and antimicrobial
      activity, which is a promising candidate for drug development, mainly to control 
      Candida infections.

TI  - Astragalus polysaccharide alleviates transport stress-induced heart injury in
      newly hatched chicks via ERS-UPR-autophagy dependent pathway.

AB  - Transport stress (TS) not only affects animal welfare but also eventually leads
      to higher morbidity and mortality. Moreover, TS could induce heart injury in
      animals, but the possible mechanism has yet to be fully explored. Astragalus
      polysaccharide (APS) is a main active component of Radix Astragali, which has an 
      extensive anti-stress effect. However, the effect of APS on TS-induced heart
      injury has not yet been elucidated. In this study, a chick model of simulated TS 
      was used. 240 newly hatched chicks were arranged into 4 groups: Control (Con),
      Transport group (T), Transport + water group (TW), and Transport + APS group
      (TA). Before transport, the chicks of the TW and TA groups were treated with
      deionized water and APS (0.25 mg/mL, 100 microL) by oral drops respectively. The 
      histopathological analysis of myocardial tissue was assessed by hematoxylin and
      eosin staining. qRT-PCR and Western Blotting assays were employed to measure the 
      expression of genes and proteins. Semiquantitative PCR was performed for the X
      box-binding protein-1 (XBP-1) mRNA splicing assay. The results indicated that APS
      significantly reduced TS-induced myocardial histopathological changes. Meanwhile,
      TS induced endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS), evidenced by an activation of the 
      unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling pathway and up-regulation of
      ERS-markers (P < 0.05). Moreover, TS markedly triggered autophagy induction by
      activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), reflected by augmented
      LC3-II/LC3-I, AMPK phosphorylation and autophagy-related genes (ATGs) expression 
      (P < 0.05). Importantly, our study manifested that treatment of APS could reduce 
      TS-induced ERS and AMPK-activated autophagy, accordingly alleviating heart injury
      of transported chicks. In summary, these findings indicate that TS induces heart 
      injury in chicks via an ERS-UPR-autophagy-dependent pathway, and APS as an
      effective therapeutic method to alleviate it.

TI  - Evidence for a neuromuscular circuit involving hypothalamic interleukin-6 in the 
      control of skeletal muscle metabolism.
PG  - eabm7355
LID - 10.1126/sciadv.abm7355 [doi]
AB  - Hypothalamic interleukin-6 (IL6) exerts a broad metabolic control. Here, we
      demonstrated that IL6 activates the ERK1/2 pathway in the ventromedial
      hypothalamus (VMH), stimulating AMPK/ACC signaling and fatty acid oxidation in
      mouse skeletal muscle. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the hypothalamic
      IL6/ERK1/2 axis is closely associated with fatty acid oxidation- and
      mitochondrial-related genes in the skeletal muscle of isogenic BXD mouse strains 
      and humans. We showed that the hypothalamic IL6/ERK1/2 pathway requires the
      alpha2-adrenergic pathway to modify fatty acid skeletal muscle metabolism. To
      address the physiological relevance of these findings, we demonstrated that this 
      neuromuscular circuit is required to underpin AMPK/ACC signaling activation and
      fatty acid oxidation after exercise. Last, the selective down-regulation of IL6
      receptor in VMH abolished the effects of exercise to sustain AMPK and ACC
      phosphorylation and fatty acid oxidation in the muscle after exercise. Together, 
      these data demonstrated that the IL6/ERK axis in VMH controls fatty acid
      metabolism in the skeletal muscle.

AB  - Purpose: We sought to reveal the expression profiles of transfer RNA-derived
      small RNAs (tsRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) in the vitreous humor of patients with
      proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). Methods: Vitreous humor samples were
      obtained from PDR patients and a control group for this study. Sequencing of
      small RNAs was conducted to assess the expression profiles of tsRNAs and miRNAs
      in both groups, which was followed by validation using reverse
      transcription-quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR).
      Bioinformatics analyses were conducted to predict the target genes and their
      potential biological functions and signaling pathways. Results: A total of 37
      tsRNAs and 70 miRNAs with significant differences were screened out from the
      vitreous humor samples of PDR patients compared to controls. Following validation
      by RT-qPCR, the target genes of the validated tsRNAs and miRNAs were predicted,
      and Gene Ontology analysis indicated that the target genes of the tsRNAs were
      most enriched in the cellular macromolecule metabolic process, cytoplasm, and
      ion-binding, while those of the miRNAs were most abundant in the regulation of
      major metabolic process, cytoplasm, and protein-binding. In addition, Kyoto
      Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis showed that the target genes
      of said tsRNAs and miRNAs were most enriched in the adenosine
      monophosphate-activated protein kinase signaling pathway and Th17 cell
      differentiation, respectively. Conclusions: The present study identified altered 
      tsRNAs and miRNAs in vitreous humor samples of PDR patients, which may play
      important roles in the pathogenesis of PDR and could be considered potential
      therapeutic targets in the treatment of PDR.

TI  - Evaluating the efficacy and mechanism of metformin targets on reducing
      Alzheimer's disease risk in the general population: a Mendelian randomisation
      study.
LID - 10.1007/s00125-022-05743-0 [doi]
AB  - AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Metformin use has been associated with reduced incidence of
      dementia in diabetic individuals in observational studies. However, the causality
      between the two in the general population is unclear. This study uses Mendelian
      randomisation (MR) to investigate the causal effect of metformin targets on
      Alzheimer's disease and potential causal mechanisms in the brain linking the two.
      METHODS: Genetic proxies for the effects of metformin drug targets were
      identified as variants in the gene for the corresponding target that associated
      with HbA1c level (N=344,182) and expression level of the corresponding gene
      (N</=31,684). The cognitive outcomes were derived from genome-wide association
      studies comprising 527,138 middle-aged Europeans, including 71,880 with
      Alzheimer's disease or Alzheimer's disease-by-proxy. MR estimates representing
      lifelong metformin use on Alzheimer's disease and cognitive function in the
      general population were generated. Effect of expression level of 22
      metformin-related genes in brain cortex (N=6601 donors) on Alzheimer's disease
      was further estimated. RESULTS: Genetically proxied metformin use, equivalent to 
      a 6.75 mmol/mol (1.09%) reduction on HbA1c, was associated with 4% lower odds of 
      Alzheimer's disease (OR 0.96 [95% CI 0.95, 0.98], p=1.06x10(-4)) in non-diabetic 
      individuals. One metformin target, mitochondrial complex 1 (MCI), showed a robust
      effect on Alzheimer's disease (OR 0.88, p=4.73x10(-4)) that was independent of
      AMP-activated protein kinase. MR of expression in brain cortex tissue showed that
      decreased MCI-related gene (NDUFA2) expression was associated with lower
      Alzheimer's disease risk (OR 0.95, p=4.64x10(-4)) and favourable cognitive
      function. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Metformin use may cause reduced Alzheimer's
      disease risk in the general population. Mitochondrial function and the NDUFA2
      gene are plausible mechanisms of action in dementia protection.

AB  - Growth hormone transgenic coho salmon experience increased growth rates, driven
      primarily through elevated feed intake and feed conversion. However,
      neuropeptides that signal appetite stimulation have been shown to exhibit
      variable responses across fed states, suggesting a more complex system mediating 
      growth in these fish. Studies have proposed that growth hormone may have a
      modulatory role on the energy reserves of fish, possibly through AMP-activated
      protein kinase (AMPK) activation. AMPK, an energy sensor in cells, has previously
      been shown to be upregulated in growth hormone transgenic salmon when compared to
      wild type, however, whether this effect is seen across fed states is unknown.
      Here, we tested the hypothesis that growth hormone induces an energetic deficit
      in metabolic tissues, leading to constitutive AMPK activation in growth hormone
      transgenic salmon. This study compared AMPK activity, ATP, and glycogen, of the
      liver, heart, and muscle of wild-type, and growth hormone transgenic salmon
      either fed to satiation or a wild-type ration. The results suggest that white
      muscle ATP levels in growth hormone salmon are elevated in satiation and rationed
      conditions. In the liver, growth hormone transgenic salmon fed a rationed
      wild-type diet experience reductions in ATP level and glycogen. In none of the
      tissues examined, did AMPK activity change. Taken together, these results
      indicate that growth hormone transgenic salmon experience metabolic duress when
      not fed to satiation.

AB  - The cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) signaling
      pathway, as vital component of innate immune system, acts a vital role in
      distinguishing invasive pathogens and cytosolic DNA. Cytosolic DNA sensor cGAS
      first binds to cytosolic DNA and catalyzes synthesis of cyclic guanosine
      monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP), which is known as the second
      messenger. Next, cGAMP activates the adaptor protein STING, triggering a
      molecular chain reaction to stimulate cytokines including interferons (IFNs).
      Recently, many researches have revealed that the regulatory role of cGAS-STING
      signaling pathway in autoimmune diseases (AIDs) such as Rheumatoid arthritis
      (RA), Aicardi Goutieres syndrome (AGS) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
      Moreover, accumulated evidence have showed inhibition of the cGAS-STING signaling
      pathway could remarkably suppress the joint swelling and inflammatory cell
      infiltration in RA mice. Therefore, in this review, we describe the molecular
      properties, biologic function and mechanisms of the cGAS-STING signaling pathway 
      in AIDs. In addition, potential clinical applications especially selective small 
      molecule inhibitors targeting the cGAS-STING signaling pathway are also
      discussed.

TI  - PI3K(p110alpha) as a determinant and gene therapy for atrial enlargement in
      atrial fibrillation.
LID - 10.1007/s11010-022-04526-w [doi]
AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an irregular heart rhythm, characterised by chaotic
      atrial activation, which is promoted by remodelling. Once initiated, AF can also 
      propagate the progression of itself in the so-called ''AF begets AF''. Several
      lines of investigation have shown that signalling molecules, including reactive
      oxygen species, angiotensin II, and phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks), in
      presence or absence of cardiovascular disease risk factors, stabilise and promote
      AF maintenance. In particular, reduced cardiac-specific PI3K activity that is not
      associated with oncology is cardiotoxic and increases susceptibility to AF.
      Atrial-specific PI3K(p110alpha) transgene can cause pathological atrial
      enlargement. Highlighting the crucial importance of the p110alpha protein in a
      clinical problem that currently challenges the professional health care practice,
      in over forty (40) transgenic mouse models of AF (Table1), currently existing, of
      which some of the models are models of human genetic disorders, including
      PI3K(p110alpha) transgenic mouse model, over 70% of them reporting atrial size
      showed enlarged, greater atrial size. Individuals with minimal to severely
      dilated atria develop AF more likely. Left atrial diameter and volume
      stratification are an assessment for follow-up surveillance to detect AF. Gene
      therapy to reduce atrial size will be associated with a reduction in AF burden.
      In this overview, PI3K(p110alpha), a master regulator of organ size, was
      investigated in atrial enlargement and in physiological determinants that promote
      AF. Table 1 Transgenic and Knockout Mouse Models of AF Gene Alteration Atrial

TI  - MCAD activation by empagliflozin promotes fatty acid oxidation and reduces lipid 
      deposition in NASH.
LID - 10.1530/JME-22-0022 [doi]
LID - JME-22-0022 [pii]
AB  - Medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) is one of the significant enzymes
      involved in beta-oxidation of mitochondrial fatty acids. MCAD deficiency affects 
      the beta-oxidation of fatty acid and leads to lipid deposition in multiple
      organs, but little is known about its importance in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis 
      (NASH). Empagliflozin is revealed to effectively improve NASH by increasing
      research, whereas the specific mechanism still has to explore. Human liver
      tissues of patients with or without NASH were obtained for proteomic analysis to 
      screen proteins of interest. Db/db mice were given empagliflozin by gavage for 8 
      weeks. The expression of MCAD and signaling molecules involved in hepatic lipid
      metabolism were evaluated in human liver, mice and HL7702 cells. We found that
      the MCAD levels in the liver were significantly reduced in NASH patients compared
      to patients without NASH. Protein protein interaction (PPI) network analysis
      showed that MCAD was highly correlated with forkhead box A2 (FOXA2) and protein
      kinase AMP-activated catalytic subunit alpha (PRKAA). AMPK/FOXA2/MCAD signaling
      pathway was detected to be inhibited in the liver of NASH patients. Decreased
      expression of MCAD was also observed in the livers of db/db mice and hepatocyte
      treated with palmitic acid (PA) and glucose. Of note, empagliflozin could
      upregulate MCAD expression by activating AMPK/FOXA2 signaling pathway, reduce
      lipid deposition and improve NASH in vivo and in vitro. This research
      demonstrated that MCAD is a key player of hepatic lipid deposition and it's
      targeting partially corrects NASH. MCAD thus may be a potential therapeutic
      target for the treatment of NASH.

LID - 10.1093/jat/bkac055 [doi]
AB  - Amphetamines in hair were investigated with thousands of workplace testing head
      and body hair samples collected and analyzed over ten years and tabulated by
      year. All samples were washed by a published extensive method prior to
      confirmation by LC-MS/MS. Presented are concentrations of parent (methamphetamine
      (METH), 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA), and methylenedioxy-amphetamine
      (MDA) as metabolite and amphetamine (AMP) as metabolite and without presence of
      parent drug. Some differences in METH concentrations from year-to-year were
      significant, and some ratios of metabolite to parent drug for both METH and MDMA 
      also varied significantly. While rates of METH use may not have changed
      significantly, some aspects of the drugs ingested as demonstrated by hair
      analysis varied over the ten-year period.

AB  - Previous studies have not completely elucidated the role of the histaminergic
      system in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. This study aimed to evaluate the effects
      of adalimumab and cyclosporine A on the expression of histaminergic
      system-related genes and miRNAs regulating these genes in bacterial
      lipopolysaccharide A (LPS)-stimulated human keratinocyte (HaCaT) cells. HaCaT
      cells were treated with 1 microg/mL LPS for 8 h, followed by treatment with 8
      microg/mL adalimumab or 100 ng/mL cyclosporine A for 2, 8, or 24 h. Untreated
      cells served as controls. The cells were subjected to ribonucleic acid (RNA)
      extraction and microarray, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and 
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analyses. Statistical analysis was performed
      using the Statistica 13.0 PL (StatSoft, Cracow, Poland) and the Transcriptome

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Health professionals are at the forefront of information and
      acceptability regarding contraceptive methods, however only one study evaluated
      their knowledge of male contraception (MC) including hormonal MC (HMC) and
      thermal MC (TMC). Our objective was to evaluate the knowledge, professional
      attitudes, and training of French practitioners regarding the management of
      couple contraception by male contraception (MC). STUDY DESIGN: We designed a
      descriptive, cross-sectional, multicentre study in 2,396 French practitioners
      belonging to national or regional institutions involved in contraception. We
      solicited practitioners by e-mail to complete an anonymous questionnaire; we
      analysed their knowledge, professional attitudes, and training regarding the
      management of couple contraception by MC. RESULTS: The overall participation rate
      was 18% (427/2,396). Condoms, withdrawal, and vasectomy were known by 98%, 89%,
      and 76% of the population, respectively. Hormonal MC and Thermal (TMC) were known
      by 10% and 24% of the population, respectively. Fifty-five percent of the
      population never or infrequently offered MC during a couple's contraceptive
      request consultation. Only 14% of the population had ever participated in
      training on MC; 96% wanted to be better trained on MC, and 87% expressed a
      willingness to participate in training on the subject. CONCLUSIONS: Health
      professionals involved in contraception have unsatisfactory knowledge about MC
      methods based on spermatogenesis inhibition and are eager to have more
      information about them. To advance the acceptability and dissemination of MC
      methods, it seems imperative to enhance research in the field and to provide
      health professionals with an adapted training programme.

TI  - Rosuvastatin potentiates the thyrotropin-lowering effect of metformin in men with
      non-autoimmune subclinical hypothyroidism and prediabetes.
LID - 10.1111/jcpt.13746 [doi]
AB  - WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Metformin treatment decreases thyrotropin levels in 
      individuals with hypothyroidism and this effect seems to be mediated by the
      5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase pathway in the pituitary. The
      activity of this pathway is also stimulated by statins. The current study was
      aimed at investigating whether the impact of metformin on
      hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis activity is affected by statin use. METHODS: 
      The study included three matched groups of men with non-autoimmune hypothyroidism
      and prediabetes: patients treated for at least 6 months with high-intensity
      rosuvastatin therapy (20-40 mg daily) [groups A (n = 24) and C (n = 19)] and men 
      not receiving statin therapy [group B (n = 24)]. Over the entire study period (6 
      months), groups A and B received metformin (2.55-3 g daily). Moreover, groups A
      and C continued rosuvastatin therapy. The lipid profile, glucose homeostasis
      markers, and plasma concentrations of thyrotropin, total and free thyroid
      hormones, prolactin, FSH, LH, ACTH and insulin-like growth factor-1 were
      determined at baseline and 6 months later. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Fifty-nine
      patients completed the study. There were differences between groups A and C and
      group B in baseline values of total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, gonadotropins
      and ACTH. Although observed in both groups of metformin-treated patients, the
      effect on thyrotropin levels was more pronounced in group A than in group B. The 
      impact on fasting glucose and insulin sensitivity was stronger in group B than
      group A. In turn, only in group A metformin tended to reduce gonadotropin levels.
      There were no differences between follow-up and baseline values of lipids, total 
      and free thyroid hormones, prolactin, ACTH and insulin-like growth factor-1 in
      both these groups. In group C, all assessed variables remained at a similar
      level. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: The results of the current study suggest that 
      rosuvastatin potentiates the inhibitory effect of metformin on thyrotrope
      secretory function.

TI  - Endothelial UCP2 Is a Mechanosensitive Suppressor of Atherosclerosis.
PG  - 101161CIRCRESAHA122321187
LID - 10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.122.321187 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflamed endothelial cells (ECs) trigger atherogenesis, especially at
      arterial regions experiencing disturbed blood flow. UCP2 (Uncoupling protein 2), 
      a key mitochondrial antioxidant protein, improves endothelium-dependent
      relaxation in obese mice. However, whether UCP2 can be regulated by shear flow is
      unknown, and the role of endothelial UCP2 in regulating inflammation and
      atherosclerosis remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the
      mechanoregulation of UCP2 expression in ECs and the effect of UCP2 on endothelial
      inflammation and atherogenesis. METHODS: In vitro shear stress simulation system 
      was used to investigate the regulation of UCP2 expression by shear flow.
      EC-specific Ucp2 knockout mice were used to investigate the role of UCP2 in
      flow-associated atherosclerosis. RESULTS: Shear stress experiments showed that
      KLF2 (Kruppel-like factor 2) mediates fluid shear stress-dependent regulation of 
      UCP2 expression in human aortic and human umbilical vein ECs. Unidirectional
      shear stress, statins, and resveratrol upregulate whereas oscillatory shear
      stress and proinflammatory stimuli inhibit UCP2 expression through altered KLF2
      expression. KLF2 directly binds to UCP2 promoter to upregulate its transcription 
      in human umbilical vein ECs. UCP2 knockdown induced expression of genes involved 
      in proinflammatory and profibrotic signaling, resulting in a proatherogenic
      endothelial phenotype. EC-specific Ucp2 deletion promotes atherogenesis and
      collagen production. Additionally, we found endothelial Ucp2 deficiency
      aggravates whereas adeno-associated virus-mediated EC-Ucp2 overexpression
      inhibits carotid atherosclerotic plaque formation in disturbed flow-enhanced
      atherosclerosis mouse model. RNA-sequencing analysis revealed FoxO1 (forkhead box
      protein O1) as the major proinflammatory transcriptional regulator activated by
      UCP2 knockdown, and FoxO1 inhibition reduced vascular inflammation and disturbed 
      flow-enhanced atherosclerosis. We showed further that UCP2 level is critical for 
      phosphorylation of AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase), which is required for
      UCP2-induced inhibition of FoxO1. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, our studies uncover
      that UCP2 is novel mechanosensitive gene under the control of fluid shear stress 
      and KLF2 in ECs. UCP2 expression is critical for endothelial proinflammatory
      response and atherogenesis. Therapeutic strategies enhancing UCP2 level may have 
      therapeutic potential against atherosclerosis.

      CD206 was performed. Results: We evaluated 15 invasive and 21 non-invasive NFPAs.
      A total of 22 metabolites were identified through non-targeted metabolomics
      analysis. Among them, the expression of 1-octadecanol, inosine 5'-monophosphate, 
      adenosine 5'-monophosphate, guanosine 5'-monophosphate, creatinine, desmosterol, 
      taurine, hypotaurine, lactic acid, and succinic acid was upregulated in invasive 
      NFPAs, while that of 1-oleoylglycerol, arachidonic acid, cis-11-eicosenoic acid, 
      docosahexaenoic acid, glyceric acid, hypoxanthine, linoleic acid, lysine, oleic
      acid, uracil, valine, and xanthine was downregulated. Immunohistochemical
      analysis suggested that the number of CD206-positive cells was higher in invasive
      NFPAs than in non-invasive NFPAs. Conclusion: Invasive and non-invasive NFPAs
      showed distinct metabolite profiles. The levels of succinic acid and lactic acid 
      were higher in invasive NFPAs, and the high expression of the M2 macrophage
      marker was verified in invasive NFPAs.

TI  - Estimation of the Mixed Layer Depth in the Indian Ocean from Surface Parameters: 
      A Clustering-Neural Network Method.
LID - 5600 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/s22155600 [doi]
AB  - The effective estimation of mixed-layer depth (MLD) plays a significant role in
      the study of ocean dynamics and global climate change. However, the methods of
      estimating MLD still have limitations due to the sparse resolution of the
      observed data. In this study, a hybrid estimation method that combines the
      K-means clustering algorithm and an artificial neural network (ANN) model was
      developed using sea-surface parameter data in the Indian Ocean as a case study.
      The oceanic datasets from January 2012 to December 2019 were obtained via
      satellite observations, Argo in situ data, and reanalysis data. These datasets
      were unified to the same spatial and temporal resolution (1 degrees x 1 degrees ,
      monthly). Based on the processed datasets, the K-means classifier was applied to 
      divide the Indian Ocean into four regions with different characteristics. For ANN
      training and testing in each region, the gridded data of 84 months were used for 
      training, and 12-month data were used for testing. The ANN results show that the 
      optimized NN architecture comprises five input variables, one output variable,
      and four hidden layers, each of which has 40 neurons. Compared with the multiple 
      linear regression model (MLR) with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 5.2248 m
      and the HYbrid-Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) with an RMSE of 4.8422 m, the RMSE 
      of the model proposed in this study was reduced by 27% and 22%, respectively.
      Three typical regions with high variability in their MLDs were selected to
      further evaluate the performance of the ANN model. Our results showed that the
      model could reveal the seasonal variation trend in each of the selected regions, 
      but the estimation accuracy showed room for improvement. Furthermore, a
      correlation analysis between the MLD and input variables showed that the surface 
      temperature and salinity were the main influencing factors of the model. The
      results of this study suggest that the pre-clustering ANN method proposed could
      be used to estimate and analyze the MLD in the Indian Ocean. Moreover, this
      method can be further expanded to estimate other internal parameters for typical 
      ocean regions and to provide effective technical support for ocean researchers
      when studying the variability of these parameters.

TI  - Time-Frequency Mask-Aware Bidirectional LSTM: A Deep Learning Approach for
      Underwater Acoustic Signal Separation.
LID - 5598 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/s22155598 [doi]
AB  - Underwater acoustic signal separation is a key technique for underwater
      communications. The existing methods are mostly model-based, and cannot
      accurately characterize the practical underwater acoustic communication
      environment. They are only suitable for binary signal separation and cannot
      handle multivariate signal separation. However, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) 
      show a powerful ability to extract the features of temporal sequences. Inspired
      by this, in this paper, we present a data-driven approach for underwater acoustic
      signal separation using deep learning technology. We use a bidirectional long
      short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) approach to explore the features of a time-frequency 
      (T-F) mask, and propose a T-F-mask-aware Bi-LSTM for signal separation. Taking
      advantage of the sparseness of the T-F image, the designed Bi-LSTM network is
      able to extract the discriminative features for separation, which further
      improves the separation performance. In particular, this method breaks through
      the limitations of the existing methods and not only achieves good results in
      multivariate separation but also effectively separates signals when they are
      mixed with 40 dB Gaussian noise signals. The experimental results show that this 
      method can achieve a 97% guarantee ratio (PSR), and the average similarity
      coefficient of the multivariate signal separation is stable above 0.8 under high 
      noise conditions. It should be noted that our model can only handle known signals
      such as test signals for calibration.

TI  - Lightweight Single Image Super-Resolution with Selective Channel Processing
      Network.
LID - 5586 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/s22155586 [doi]
AB  - With the development of deep learning, considerable progress has been made in
      image restoration. Notably, many state-of-the-art single image super-resolution
      (SR) methods have been proposed. However, most of them contain many parameters,
      which leads to a significant amount of calculation consumption in the inference
      phase. To make current SR networks more lightweight and resource-friendly, we
      present a convolution neural network with the proposed selective channel
      processing strategy (SCPN). Specifically, the selective channel processing module
      (SCPM) is first designed to dynamically learn the significance of each channel in
      the feature map using a channel selection matrix in the training phase.
      Correspondingly, in the inference phase, only the essential channels indicated by
      the channel selection matrixes need to be further processed. By doing so, we can 
      significantly reduce the parameters and the calculation consumption. Moreover,
      the differential channel attention (DCA) block is proposed, which takes into
      consideration the data distribution of the channels in feature maps to restore
      more high-frequency information. Extensive experiments are performed on the
      natural image super-resolution benchmarks (i.e., Set5, Set14, B100, Urban100,
      Manga109) and remote-sensing benchmarks (i.e., UCTest and RESISCTest), and our
      method achieves superior results to other state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, 
      our method keeps a slim size with fewer than 1 M parameters, which proves the
      superiority of our method. Owing to the proposed SCPM and DCA, our SCPN model
      achieves a better trade-off between calculation cost and performance in both
      general and remote-sensing SR applications, and our proposed method can be
      extended to other computer vision tasks for further research.

TI  - Low-Cost Metamaterial Antennas: Forward-Looking Imaging Experiment and Analysis.
LID - 5563 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/s22155563 [doi]
AB  - A phase error correction method is proposed to compensate for the phase error in 
      super-resolution correlated imaging based on metamaterial antennas. The varying
      carrier frequencies of a metamaterial antenna can generate the random radiation
      field for super-resolution correlation imaging, but the variation of the signal
      carrier frequency leads to large phase errors in the imaging results. In this
      proposed method, the sampling matrix in the super-resolution correlated imaging
      algorithm is used to compensate for the phase errors. Each element of the matrix 
      is multiplied by a compensation phase corresponding to the phase error, and the
      error is subtly removed from the algorithm. In the experiment, the antenna
      pattern at each frequency of the metamaterial antenna is measured and recorded.
      In addition, an external field experiment is also carried out, and the collected 
      data are imaged with the improved algorithm. Experimental results show that this 
      technology can effectively solve the effect of phase errors on imaging results
      caused by signal carrier frequency changes.

TI  - FPCB as an Acoustic Matching Layer for 1D Linear Ultrasound Transducer Arrays.
LID - 5557 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/s22155557 [doi]
AB  - An acoustic matching layer is an essential component of an ultrasound transducer 
      to achieve maximum ultrasound transmission efficiency. Here, we develop a
      flexible printed circuit board (FPCB) with a composite structure consisting of
      multiple polyimide and copper layers and demonstrate it as a novel acoustic
      matching layer. With a flexible substrate and robust ACF bonding, the FPCB not
      only serves as an acoustic matching layer between piezoelectric elements and the 
      surrounding medium but also as a ground for the electrical connection between the
      transducer array elements and the folded substrate. A 1D linear ultrasound
      transducer array with the FPCB matching layer exhibits larger output pressure,
      wider -3dB bandwidth, and higher ultrasound beam intensity compared to that of an
      ultrasound transducer array with the alumina/epoxy matching layer, which is one
      of the most commonly applied composite matching layers. The enhanced transmission
      performance verifies that the proposed FPCB is an excellent matching layer for 1D
      linear ultrasound transducer arrays.

TI  - A Novel Design and Development of a Strip-Fed Circularly Polarized Rectangular
      Dielectric Resonator Antenna for 5G NR Sub-6 GHz Band Applications.
LID - 5531 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/s22155531 [doi]
AB  - In this article, a rectangular dielectric resonator antenna (RDRA) with
      circularly polarized (CP) response is presented for 5G NR (New Radio) Sub-6 GHz
      band applications. A uniquely shaped conformal metal feeding strip is proposed to
      excite the RDRA in higher-order mode for high gain utilization. By using the
      proposed feeding mechanism, the degenerate mode pair of the first higher-order,
      i.e., TEdelta13x at 4.13 GHz and TE1delta3y,&amp;nbsp; at 4.52 GHz is excited to 
      achieve a circularly polarized response. A circular polarization over a bandwidth
      of ~10%, in conjunction with a wide impedance matching over a bandwidth of ~17%, 
      were attained by the antenna. The CP antenna proposed offers a useful gain of
      ~6.2 dBic. The achieved CP bandwidth of the RDRA is good enough to cover the
      targeted 5G NR bands around 4.4-4.8 GHz, such as n79. The proposed antenna
      configuration is modelled and optimized using computer simulation technology
      (CST). A prototype was built to confirm (validate) the performance estimated
      through simulation. A good agreement was observed between simulated and measured 
      results.

TI  - A Novel Method to Measure the Static Coefficient of Friction for Socks.
LID - 5525 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/s22155525 [doi]
AB  - Mechanical testers have commonly been used to measure the frictional properties
      of socks. However, the friction values may be susceptible to the level of
      stretchiness of tested fabrics or human variability. Thus, the aim of this study 
      was to propose a novel method that enables friction measurement of socks in a
      sock-wearing condition with less human variability effects. Five socks with
      different frictional properties were chosen. Three experimental ramp tests were
      performed with an artificial structure shaped like the foot-ankle complex (last) 
      and a ramp tester to quantify the static coefficient of friction (COF) at the
      foot against sock, at the sock against an insole, and the foot wearing socks
      against the insole, respectively. The angle where the last slipped while the ramp
      surface was gradually inclined was used to compute the static COF values for each
      sock. The reliability was 0.99, and COF values ranged from 0.271 to 0.861 at the 
      foot-sock interface, 0.342 to 0.639 at the sock-insole interface, and 0.310 to
      0.614 in the third test. Socks with different frictional properties were
      successfully distinguished each other. Thus, the suggested protocol could be a
      reliable option for measuring the static COF values in the tension similar with
      it found in a sock-waring condition with reduced effects of human variability.

TI  - Deep Unsupervised Domain Adaptation with Time Series Sensor Data: A Survey.
LID - 5507 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/s22155507 [doi]
AB  - Sensors are devices that output signals for sensing physical phenomena and are
      widely used in all aspects of our social production activities. The continuous
      recording of physical parameters allows effective analysis of the operational
      status of the monitored system and prediction of unknown risks. Thanks to the
      development of deep learning, the ability to analyze temporal signals collected
      by sensors has been greatly improved. However, models trained in the source
      domain do not perform well in the target domain due to the presence of domain
      gaps. In recent years, many researchers have used deep unsupervised domain
      adaptation techniques to address the domain gap between signals collected by
      sensors in different scenarios, i.e., using labeled data in the source domain and
      unlabeled data in the target domain to improve the performance of models in the
      target domain. This survey first summarizes the background of recent research on 
      unsupervised domain adaptation with time series sensor data, the types of sensors
      used, the domain gap between the source and target domains, and commonly used
      datasets. Then, the paper classifies and compares different unsupervised domain
      adaptation methods according to the way of adaptation and summarizes different
      adaptation settings based on the number of source and target domains. Finally,
      this survey discusses the challenges of the current research and provides an
      outlook on future work. This survey systematically reviews and summarizes recent 
      research on unsupervised domain adaptation for time series sensor data to provide
      the reader with a systematic understanding of the field.

TI  - Evaluating the Forest Ecosystem through a Semi-Autonomous Quadruped Robot and a
      Hexacopter UAV.
LID - 5497 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/s22155497 [doi]
AB  - Accurate and timely monitoring is imperative to the resilience of forests for
      economic growth and climate regulation. In the UK, forest management depends on
      citizen science to perform tedious and time-consuming data collection tasks. In
      this study, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with a light sensor and
      positioning capabilities is deployed to perform aerial surveying and to observe a
      series of forest health indicators (FHIs) which are inaccessible from the ground.
      However, many FHIs such as burrows and deadwood can only be observed from under
      the tree canopy. Hence, we take the initiative of employing a quadruped robot
      with an integrated camera as well as an external sensing platform (ESP) equipped 
      with light and infrared cameras, computing, communication and power modules to
      observe these FHIs from the ground. The forest-monitoring time can be extended by
      reducing computation and conserving energy. Therefore, we analysed different
      versions of the YOLO object-detection algorithm in terms of accuracy, deployment 
      and usability by the EXP to accomplish an extensive low-latency detection. In
      addition, we constructed a series of new datasets to train the YOLOv5x and
      YOLOv5s for recognising FHIs. Our results reveal that YOLOv5s is lightweight and 
      easy to train for FHI detection while performing close to real-time,
      cost-effective and autonomous forest monitoring.

TI  - Timeline of the Development of Skin-Lightening Active Ingredients in Japan.
LID - 4774 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27154774 [doi]
AB  - Japanese pharmaceutical cosmetics, often referred to as quasi-drugs, contain
      skin-lightening active ingredients formulated to prevent sun-induced pigment
      spots and freckles. Their mechanisms of action include suppressing melanin
      production in melanocytes and promoting epidermal growth to eliminate melanin
      more rapidly. For example, arbutin and rucinol are representative skin-lightening
      active ingredients that inhibit melanin production, and disodium adenosine
      monophosphate and dexpanthenol are skin-lightening active ingredients that
      inhibit melanin accumulation in the epidermis. In contrast, oral administration
      of vitamin C and tranexamic acid in pharmaceutical products can lighten freckles 
      and melasma, and these products are more effective than quasi-drugs. On the basis
      of their clinical effectiveness, skin-lightening active ingredients can be
      divided into four categories according to their effectiveness and adverse
      effects. This review discusses academic research and development regarding
      skin-lightening ingredients in Japan.

TI  - Action of Mangifera indica Leaf Extract on Acne-Prone Skin through Sebum
      Harmonization and Targeting C. acnes.
LID - 4769 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27154769 [doi]
AB  - (1) Background: Preclinical studies report that the ethanolic fraction from
      Mangifera&amp;nbsp;indica leaves is a potential anti-acne agent. Nevertheless,
      the biological activity of Mangifera indica leaves has scarcely been
      investigated, and additional data are needed, especially in a clinical setting,
      for establishing the actual effectiveness of Mangifera indica extract as an
      active component of anti-acne therapy. (2) Methods: The evaluation of the
      biological activity of Mangifera indica extract was carried out through different
      experimental phases, which comprised in silico, in vitro, ex vivo and clinical
      evaluations. (3) Results: In silico and in vitro studies allowed us to identify
      the phytomarkers carrying the activity of seboregulation and acne management.
      Results showed that Mangifera indica extract reduced lipid production by 40% in
      sebocytes, and an improvement of the sebum quality was reported after the
      treatment in analyses performed on sebaceous glands from skin explants. The
      evaluation of the sebum quantity and quality using triglyceride/free fatty acid
      analysis conducted on Caucasian volunteers evidenced a strong improvement and a
      reduction of porphyrins expression. The C. acnes lipase activity from a severe
      acne phylotype was evaluated in the presence of Mangifera indica, and a reduction
      by 29% was reported. In addition, the analysis of the skin microbiota documented 
      that Mangifera indica protected the microbiota equilibrium while the placebo
      induced dysbiosis. (4) Conclusions: Our results showed that Mangifera indica is
      microbiota friendly and efficient against lipase activity of C. acnes and
      supports a role for Mangifera indica in the therapeutic strategy for prevention
      and treatment of acne.

TI  - Peptide Biomarkers Discovery for Seven Species of Deer Antler Using LC-MS/MS and 
      Label-Free Approach.
LID - 4756 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27154756 [doi]
AB  - Deer antler is a globally widely used precious natural medicine and the material 
      of deer horn gelatin. However, identification of deer antler species based on
      traditional approaches are problematic because of their similarity in appearance 
      and physical-chemical properties. In this study, we performed a comprehensive
      antler peptidome analysis using a label-free approach: nano LC-Orbitrap MS was
      applied to discover peptide biomarkers in deer adult beta-globin (HBBA), and
      HPLC-Triple Quadrupole MS was used to verify their specificity. Nineteen peptide 
      biomarkers were found, on which foundation a strategy for antlers and a strategy 
      for antler mixtures such as flakes or powder are provided to identify seven
      species of deer antler including Eurasian elk (Alces alces), reindeer (Rangifer
      tarandus), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus viginianus), white-lipped deer
      (Przewalskium albirostris), fallow deer (Dama dama), sika deer (Cervus nippon),
      and red deer (Cervus elaphus) simultaneously. It is worth noting that our search 
      found that the HBBA gene of sika deer, red deer, and North American wapiti
      (Cervus canadensis) in China may have undergone severe genetic drifts.

TI  - Elecampane (Inula helenium) Root Extract and Its Major Sesquiterpene Lactone,
      Alantolactone, Inhibit Adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 Preadipocytes.
LID - 4765 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27154765 [doi]
AB  - Recent studies have shown that Nur77 and AMPKalpha play an important role in
      regulating adipogenesis and isoalantolactone (ISO) dual-targeting AMPKalpha and
      Nur77 inhibits adipogenesis. In this study, we hypothesized that Inula helenium
      (elecampane) root extract (IHE), which contains two sesquiterpene lactones,
      alantolactone (ALA) and ISO, as major compounds, might inhibit adipogenesis.
      Here, we found that ALA and IHE simultaneously target AMPKalpha and Nur77 and
      inhibited adipogenic differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells, accompanied by the
      decreased expression of adipocyte markers. Further mechanistic studies
      demonstrated that IHE shares similar mechanisms of action with ISO that reduce
      mitotic clonal expansion during the early phase of adipogenic differentiation and
      decrease expression of cell cycle regulators. These results suggest that IHE
      inhibits adipogenesis, in part, through co-regulation of AMPKalpha and Nur77, and
      has potential as a therapeutic option for obesity and related metabolic
      dysfunction.

TI  - Structure-Based Bioisosterism Design, Synthesis, Biological Activity and Toxicity
      of 1,2,4-Oxadiazole Substituted Benzamides Analogues Containing Pyrazole Rings.
LID - 4692 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27154692 [doi]
AB  - In order to discover pesticidal lead compounds with high activity and low
      toxicity, a series of novel benzamides substituted with pyrazole-linked
      1,2,4-oxadiazole were designed via bioisosterism. The chemical structures of the 
      target compounds were confirmed via (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR and HRMS analysis. The
      preliminary bioassay showed that most compounds exhibited good lethal activities 
      against Mythimna separate, Helicoverpa armigera, Ostrinia nubilalis and
      Spodoptera frugiperda at 500 mg/L. Particularly in the case of Mythimna separate,
      compound 14q (70%) exhibited obvious insecticidal activity. In addition, compound
      14h demonstrated good fungicidal activity against Pyricularia oryae with an
      inhibition rate of 77.8%, and compounds 14e, 14k, 14n and 14r also showed certain
      antifungal activities (55.6-66.7%). The zebrafish toxicity test showed that the
      LC50 of compound 14h was 14.01 mg/L, which indicated that it may be used as a
      potential leading compound for further structural optimization.

TI  - Beneficial Effect of Methanolic Extract of Frankincense (Boswellia Sacra) on
      Testis Mediated through Suppression of Oxidative Stress and Apoptosis.

AB  - Boswellia sacra oleo gum resin (Burseraceae) commonly known as frankincense is
      traditionally used in many countries for its beneficial effect on male fertility.
      This study explores its effect on the male reproductive system after a 60-day
      repeated administration at two different doses to rats (in vivo) and on human
      Leydig cells (in vitro). The methanolic extract of B. sacra was analyzed for the 
      presence of various constituents by preliminary phytochemical analysis and gas
      chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) while quantitative analysis of boswellic
      acids was done by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Administration
      of B. sacra extract to rats elevated the serum testosterone levels with an
      associated reduction in serum levels of FSH and LH. An increase in the activity
      of antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase and catalase, was seen. A
      dose-dependent increase in the sperm count and sperm motility was also observed. 
      The in vivo results were supported by changes in the expression of the Bcl-2 gene
      and caspase-3 gene in human Leydig cells in vitro. The results of this study
      support the traditional use of B. sacra to increase male fertility.

TI  - Evaluation of Water Ammonium Ion Test Kit and Its Feasibility for the Analysis of
      Protein in Food.
LID - 4689 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27154689 [doi]
AB  - The traditional method for the determination of protein in food needs the
      operations of digestion, distillation, absorption, and titration; therefore, it
      is complicated and time-consuming and requires professional personnel. Is there a
      more convenient and faster detection method that can directly determine the
      ammonium ions in protein digestion solution to obtain the protein content of food
      and avoid the distillation-absorption-titration process? The feasibility of water
      ammonium ion test kits for food protein rapid detection was discussed here. After
      digestion, the protein in food transforms into ammonium ions in the digestion
      solution. Because of the variety of food, there are many different inorganic ions
      left in the food digestion solution, and at the same time, digestion agents are
      added in the digestion process and become potential interference factors in
      ammonium determination. Therefore, the detection accuracy of ammonium test kits
      needs to be evaluated first, including their anti-interference ability. The
      standard curve of ammonium was established by the test kit. When the ammonium
      concentration was 0.00-2.50 mg/L, the absorbance at 620 nm was linearly related
      to the ammonium concentration, the determination coefficient R(2) was 0.9995, and
      the detection limit of this method was 0.01 mg/L. The influences of temperature, 
      pH value, and reaction time on the test kit method were discussed. The precision 
      was 0.90-3.33%; the repeatability was 1.71-4.86%; and the recovery rate of tap
      water, river water, and sea water was controlled within 90-103%. The
      anti-interference ability of the evaluated test kit was better than that of the
      national standard detection method. The test kit, combined with sample
      pretreatment and protein conversion formula, was used to detect protein in
      different types of food (milk powder, rice flour, wheat flour, soy, banana, milk,
      fish food, chicken food, and dog food). The results showed that there were no
      significant differences (rho &gt; 0.05) between the national method and the test 
      kit method. The ammonium ion test kit method shortened the determination time and
      had higher sensitivity, showing its potential for the rapid determination of food
      protein.

TI  - Gut Barrier Damage and Gut Translocation of Pathogen Molecules in Lupus, an
      Impact of Innate Immunity (Macrophages and Neutrophils) in Autoimmune Disease.
LID - 8223 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23158223 [doi]
AB  - The gut barrier is a single cell layer that separates gut micro-organisms from
      the host, and gut permeability defects result in the translocation of microbial
      molecules from the gut into the blood. Despite the silent clinical manifestation,
      gut translocation of microbial molecules can induce systemic inflammation that
      might be an endogenous exacerbating factor of systemic lupus erythematosus. In
      contrast, circulatory immune-complex deposition and the effect of medications on 
      the gut, an organ with an extremely large surface area, of patients with active
      lupus might cause gut translocation of microbial molecules, which worsens lupus
      severity. Likewise, the imbalance of gut microbiota may initiate lupus and/or
      interfere with gut integrity which results in microbial translocation and lupus
      exacerbation. Moreover, immune hyper-responsiveness of innate immune cells
      (macrophages and neutrophils) is demonstrated in a lupus model from the loss of
      inhibitory Fc gamma receptor IIb (FcgRIIb), which induces prominent responses
      through the cross-link between activating-FcgRs and innate immune receptors. The 
      immune hyper-responsiveness can cause cell death, especially apoptosis and
      neutrophil extracellular traps (NETosis), which possibly exacerbates lupus,
      partly through the enhanced exposure of the self-antigens. Leaky gut monitoring
      and treatments (such as probiotics) might be beneficial in lupus. Here, we
      discuss the current information on leaky gut in lupus.

TI  - Carbamate Pesticides: Shedding Light on Their Impact on the Male Reproductive
      System.
LID - 8206 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23158206 [doi]
AB  - Carbamates are widely used and known around the world as pesticides in spite of
      also having medical applications. This class of chemicals is classified as
      acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, blocking acetylcholine hydrolyzation in a
      reversible manner. Their lack of species selectivity and their reported high
      toxicity can induce, upon exposure, adverse outcomes in male fertility that may
      lead to infertility. In addition, they are also considered endocrine-disrupting
      chemicals and can interfere with the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis,
      essential for the normal function of the male reproductive system, thus being
      able to provoke male reproductive dysfunctions. Although the molecular mechanisms
      are not fully understood, various signaling pathways, such as those mediated by
      acetylcholine or kisspeptin, are affected by exposure to carbamates, thus
      compromising steroidogenesis and spermatogenesis. Over the last decades, several 
      studies, both in vitro and in vivo, have reported a myriad of negative effects of
      carbamates on the male reproductive system. In this review, an up-to-date
      overview of the impact of carbamates on the male reproductive system is
      discussed, with an emphasis on the role of these compounds on acetylcholine
      regulation and the male endocrine system.

TI  - Genome-Wide Identification, Characterization, and Expression Analysis Related to 
      Low-Temperature Stress of the CmGLP Gene Family in Cucumis melo L.
LID - 8190 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23158190 [doi]
AB  - Germin-like protein (GLP) participates in plant growth and development and plays 
      an important role in plant stress. In the present study, 22 CmGLPs belonging to
      five classes were identified in the melon genome. Each member of the CmGLPs
      family contains a typical Cupin_1 domain. We conducted a genome-wide analysis of 
      the melon GLP gene family characterization. CmGLPs were randomly distributed in
      the melon chromosomes, with the largest number on chromosome 8, having eight
      family members. Gene duplication events drive the evolution and expansion of the 
      melon GLP gene family. Based on the phylogenetic tree analysis of GLP proteins in
      melon, rice, Arabidopsis, and cucumber, it was found that the GLP gene families
      of different species have diverged in evolution. Based on qRT-PCR results, all
      members of the CmGLP gene family could be expressed in different tissues of
      melon. Most CmGLP genes were up-regulated after low-temperature stress. The
      relative expression of CmGLP2-5 increased by 157.13 times at 48 h after
      low-temperature treatment. This finding suggests that the CmGLP2-5 might play an 
      important role in low-temperature stress in melon. Furthermore, quantitative dual
      LUC assays indicated that CmMYB23 and CmWRKY33 can bind the promoter fragment of 
      the CmGLP2-5. These results were helpful in understanding the functional
      succession and evolution of the melon GLP gene family and further revealed the
      response of CmGLPs to low-temperature stress in melon.

TI  - Effects and Mechanism of Particulate Matter on Tendon Healing Based on Integrated

AB  - Exposure to particulate matter (PM) has been linked with the severity of various 
      diseases. To date, there is no study on the relationship between PM exposure and 
      tendon healing. Open Achilles tenotomy of 20 rats was performed. The animals were
      divided into two groups according to exposure to PM: a PM group and a non-PM
      group. After 6 weeks of PM exposure, the harvest and investigations of lungs,
      blood samples, and Achilles tendons were performed. Compared to the non-PM group,
      the white blood cell count and tumor necrosis factor-alpha expression in the PM
      group were significantly higher. The Achilles tendons in PM group showed
      significantly increased inflammatory outcomes. A TEM analysis showed reduced
      collagen fibrils in the PM group. A biomechanical analysis demonstrated that the 
      load to failure value was lower in the PM group. An upregulation of the gene
      encoding cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) was detected in the
      PM group by an integrated analysis of DNA methylation and RNA sequencing data, as
      confirmed via a Western blot analysis showing significantly elevated levels of
      phosphorylated CREB. In summary, PM exposure caused a deleterious effect on
      tendon healing. The molecular data indicate that the action mechanism of PM may
      be associated with upregulated CREB signaling.

TI  - AaZFP3, a Novel CCCH-Type Zinc Finger Protein from Adonis amurensis, Promotes
      Early Flowering in Arabidopsis by Regulating the Expression of Flowering-Related 
      Genes.
LID - 8166 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23158166 [doi]
AB  - CCCH-type zinc finger proteins (ZFP) are a large family of proteins that play
      various important roles in plant growth and development; however, the functions
      of most proteins in this family are uncharacterized. In this study, a CCCH-type
      ZFP, AaZFP3, was identified in the floral organ of Adonis amurensis. Quantitative
      real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis revealed that AaZFP3 was widely expressed in the
      flowers of A.amurensis. Subcellular localization analysis showed that the AaZFP3 
      protein was mainly localized to the cytoplasm in tobacco and Arabidopsis.
      Furthermore, the overexpression of AaZFP3 promoted early flowering in
      Arabidopsis&amp;nbsp;under both normal and relatively low-temperature conditions.
      RNA-sequencing and qPCR analyses revealed that the expression of multiple key
      flowering-time genes was altered in transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing AaZFP3 
      compared to wild-type. Of these genes, FLOWERING LOCUS T (AtFT) expression was
      most significantly up-regulated, whereas FLOWERING LOCUS C (AtFLC) was
      significantly down-regulated. These results suggest that the overexpression of
      AaZFP3 promotes early flowering in Arabidopsis by affecting the expression of
      flowering-time genes. Overall, our study indicates that AaZFP3 may be involved in
      flowering regulation in A.amurensis and may represent an important genetic
      resource for improving flowering-time control in other ornamental plants or
      crops.

TI  - Molecular Identification of the G-Protein Genes and Their Expression Profiles in 
      Response to Nitrogen Deprivation in Brassica napus.
LID - 8151 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23158151 [doi]
AB  - Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding protein (G-protein) consisting of
      Galpha, Gbeta, and Ggamma subunits is one of the key signal transducers in
      plants. Recent studies indicated that G-protein has been proposed as an important
      mediator of nitrogen responses in rice, wheat, and Arabidopsis. However, little
      is known about these G-proteins in Brassica napus (B. napus), except for three
      identified G-proteins, BnGA1, BnGB1, and BnGG2. Therefore, the aim of the present
      study is to characterize the members of the G-protein gene family in
      allotetraploid B. napus and to analyze their expression profiles in response to
      nitrogen deprivation. In total, 21 G-protein family members were identified in B.
      napus, encoding two Galpha, six Gbeta, and 13 Ggamma. Sequence and phylogenetic
      analyses showed that although genome-wide triploid events increased the number of
      genes encoding Galpha, Gbeta, and Ggamma subunits, the gene structure and protein
      properties of the genes encoding each G-protein subunit were extremely conserved.
      Collinearity analysis showed that most G-protein genes in B. napus had syntenic
      relationships with G-protein members of Arabidopsis, Brassica rape (B. rapa), and
      Brassica oleracea (B. oleracea). Expression profile analysis indicated that
      Galpha and C-type Ggamma genes (except BnGG10 and BnGG12 were highly expressed in
      flower and ovule) were barely expressed in most organs, whereas most Gbeta and
      A-type Ggamma genes tended to be highly expressed in most organs. G-protein genes
      also showed various expression patterns in response to nitrogen-deficient
      conditions. Under nitrogen deficiency, Galpha and five C-type Ggamma genes were
      upregulated initially in roots, while in leaves, Galpha was downregulated
      initially and five C-type Ggamma genes were highly expressed in different times. 
      These results provide a complex genetic dissection of G-protein genes in B.
      napus, and insight into the biological functions of G-protein genes in response
      to nitrogen deficiency.

TI  - 1,4-Naphthoquinone (CNN1) Induces Apoptosis through DNA Damage and Promotes
      Upregulation of H2AFX in Leukemia Multidrug Resistant Cell Line.

LID - 10.3390/ijms23158105 [doi]
AB  - The multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype is one of the major obstacles in the
      treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in advantage stages such as blast
      crisis. In this scenario, more patients develop resistance mechanisms during the 
      course of the disease, making tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) target therapies 
      ineffective. Therefore, the aim of the study was to examine the pharmacological
      role of CNN1, a para-naphthoquinone, in a leukemia multidrug resistant cell line.
      First, the in vitro cytotoxic activity of Imatinib Mesylate (IM) in K-562 and
      FEPS cell lines was evaluated. Subsequently, membrane integrity and mitochondrial
      membrane potential assays were performed to assess the cytotoxic effects of CNN1 
      in K-562 and FEPS cell lines, followed by cell cycle, alkaline comet assay and
      annexin V-Alexa Fluor((R))&amp;nbsp;488/propidium iodide assays (Annexin/PI)
      using flow cytometry. RT-qPCR was used to evaluate the H2AFX gene expression. The
      results demonstrate that CNN1 was able to induce apoptosis, cell membrane rupture
      and mitochondrial membrane depolarization in leukemia cell lines. In addition,
      CNN1 also induced genotoxic effects and caused DNA fragmentation, cell cycle
      arrest at the G2/M phase in leukemia cells. No genotoxicity was observed on
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Additionally, CNN1 increased mRNA
      levels of H2AFX. Therefore, CNN1 presented anticancer properties against leukemia
      multidrug resistant cell line being a potential anticancer agent for the
      treatment of resistant CML.

TI  - Spontaneous and Ionizing Radiation-Induced Aggregation of Human Serum Albumin:
      Dityrosine as a Fluorescent Probe.
LID - 8090 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23158090 [doi]
AB  - The use of spectroscopic techniques has shown that human serum albumin (HSA)
      undergoes reversible self-aggregation through protein-protein interactions. It
      ensures the subsequent overlapping of electron clouds along with the stiffening
      of the conformation of the interpenetrating network of amino acids of adjacent
      HSA molecules. The HSA oxidation process related to the transfer of one electron 
      was investigated by pulse radiolysis and photochemical methods. It has been shown
      that the irradiation of HSA solutions under oxidative stress conditions results
      in the formation of stable protein aggregates. The HSA aggregates induced by
      ionizing radiation are characterized by specific fluorescence compared to the
      emission of non-irradiated solutions. We assume that HSA dimers are mainly
      responsible for the new emission. Dityrosine produced by the intermolecular
      recombination of protein tyrosine radicals as a result of radiolysis of an
      aqueous solution of the protein is the main cause of HSA aggregation by
      cross-linking. Analysis of the oxidation process of HSA confirmed that the
      reaction of mild oxidants (Br2*-,&amp;nbsp;N3*, SO4*-) with albumin leads to the 
      formation of covalent bonds between tyrosine residues. In the case of (*)OH
      radicals and partly, Cl2*-, species other than DT are formed. The light emission 
      of this species is similar to the emission of self-associated HSA.

TI  - Enhancement of Domain Wall Pinning in High-Temperature Resistant Sm2Co17 Type
      Magnets by Addition of Y2O3.
LID - 5160 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ma15155160 [doi]
AB  - In this study, the effects of Y2O3 addition on the magnetic properties,
      microstructure and magnetization reversal behavior of
      Sm(Co0.79Fe0.09Cu0.09Zr0.03)7.68 magnet were investigated. By addition of Y2O3,
      the coercivity was increased from 21.34 kOe to 27.42 kOe at 300 K and from 5.14
      kOe to 6.27 kOe at 823 K. A magnet with a maximum magnetic energy product of 9.86
      MGOe at 823 K was obtained. With the interdiffusion of Y and Sm after appropriate
      addition, the Cu content within the cell boundary phase close to the oxide was
      detected to be nearly twice as high as that away from the oxide. We report for
      the first time that a collection of lamellar phases were formed on both sides of 
      the inserted oxide, providing a strong pinning field against magnetic domain wall
      motion based on in-situ Lorentz TEM observation. Furthermore, the ordering
      process of the original magnet was delayed after Y2O3 addition, resulting in the 
      refinement of cellular structure, which can also enhance the domain wall pinning 
      ability of cellular structures based on micromagnetic simulation. However,
      excessive addition of Y2O3 led to large Cu-rich phase and Zr-rich impurity phase 
      precipitated at the edge of the oxide, resulting in the destruction of cellular
      structures and a significant reduction in coercivity. This study provides a new
      technical approach to regulate the microstructure of Sm2Co17 type magnets.
      Addition of Y2O3 is expected to play a significant role in improvement of high
      temperature magnetic properties.

TI  - Measurement of Water Absorption of Recycled Aggregate.
LID - 5141 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ma15155141 [doi]
AB  - Owing to the high absorption capacity of recycled aggregate (RA), it is crucial
      to accurately measure its saturated-surface-dried water absorption (WSSD), which 
      largely affects an effective water-to-binder ratio of recycled aggregate
      concrete. In this study, existing measurement methods for the WSSD of RA are
      extensively reviewed, including Wiping, Slumping, Centrifugation, Infrared,
      Evaporation, Airflow drying, Conductivity, Pycnometer, Hydrostatic balance, and
      Extrapolation. In particular, the physical principles and operability of these
      methods are emphasized. It was determined that the accuracy of all test results
      was not satisfactory. For example, the water in pores with an open-ended
      direction that was opposite to the centrifugal force could largely be retained.
      In Airflow drying, the temperature change was significantly delayed. In addition,
      in Hydrostatic balance, RA would pre-absorb water before determining the initial 
      reading. Therefore, several suggestions for optimizing these methods are
      presented, such as the combination of Evaporation and Airflow drying, the liquid 
      selection in Hydrostatic balance, and the addition of a tiny mixer in each
      centrifuge tube. In summary, this review facilitates the development of an
      accurate and convenient method for measuring the WSSD of RA.

TI  - Estimation of Drag Finishing Abrasive Effect for Cutting Edge Preparation in
      Broaching Tool.
LID - 5135 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ma15155135 [doi]
AB  - In recent years, cutting edge preparation became a topic of high interest in the 
      manufacturing industry because of the important role it plays in the performance 
      of the cutting tool. This paper describes the use of the drag finishing DF
      cutting edge preparation process on the cutting tool for the broaching process.
      The main process parameters were manipulated and analyzed, as well as their
      influence on the cutting edge rounding, material remove rate MRR, and surface
      quality/roughness (Ra, Rz). In parallel, a repeatability and reproducibility R&R 
      analysis and cutting edge radius re prediction were performed using machine
      learning by an artificial neural network ANN. The results achieved indicate that 
      the influencing factors on re, MRR, and roughness, in order of importance, are
      drag depth, drag time, mixing percentage, and grain size, respectively. The
      reproducibility accuracy of re is reliable compared to traditional processes,
      such as brushing and blasting. The prediction accuracy of the re of preparation
      with ANN is observed in the low training and prediction errors 1.22% and 0.77%,
      respectively, evidencing the effectiveness of the algorithm. Finally, it is
      demonstrated that the DF has reliable feasibility in the application of edge
      preparation on broaching tools under controlled conditions.

TI  - Molecular Dynamics Simulations of PtTi High-Temperature Shape Memory Alloys Based
      on a Modified Embedded-Atom Method Interatomic Potential.
LID - 5104 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ma15155104 [doi]
AB  - A new second nearest-neighbor modified embedded-atom model-based PtTi binary
      interatomic potential was developed by improving the pure Pt unary descriptions
      of the pre-existing interatomic potential. Specifically, the interatomic
      potential was developed focusing on the shape memory-associated phenomena and the
      properties of equiatomic PtTi, which has potential applications as a
      high-temperature shape memory alloy. The simulations using the developed
      interatomic potential reproduced the physical properties of the equiatomic PtTi
      and various intermetallic compound/alloy compositions and structures. Large-scale
      molecular dynamic simulations of single crystalline and nanocrystalline
      configurations were performed to examine the temperature- and stress-induced
      martensitic transformations. The results show good consistency with the
      experiments and demonstrate the reversible phase transformation of PtTi SMA
      between the cubic B2 austenite and the orthorhombic B19 martensite phases. In
      addition, the importance of anisotropy, constraint and the orientation of grains 
      on the transformation temperature, mechanical response, and microstructure of SMA
      are presented.

TI  - The Spatiotemporal Distribution and Drivers of Urban Carbon Emission Efficiency: 
      The Role of Technological Innovation.
LID - 9111 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19159111 [doi]
AB  - Urban agglomerations have become the core areas for carbon reduction in China
      since they account for around 75% of its total emissions. Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei
      (BTH), Yangtze River Delta (YRD), and the Pearl River Delta (PRD), which are its 
      most important poles of regional development and technological innovation, are
      key to achieving China's carbon peak emissions target. Based on the panel data of
      these three major urban agglomerations from 2003 to 2017, this study estimated
      the carbon emission efficiency (CEE) by the super-efficiency slacks-based measure
      (super-SBM) model and analyzed its spatiotemporal distribution pattern. The Dagum
      Gini coefficient was used to evaluate the difference in CEE between the three
      major agglomerations, while panel data models were established to analyze the
      impact of technological innovation on the three agglomerations. The overall CEE
      showed an upward trend during the study period, with significant spatial and
      temporal variations. Additionally, the main source of urban agglomeration
      difference in CEE evolved from inter-regional net differences to intensity of
      transvariation. While technological innovations are expected to significantly
      improve CEE, their effect varies among urban agglomerations. These results
      provide policymakers with insights on the collaborative planning of urban
      agglomerations and the low-carbon economy.

TI  - Measured and Perceived Effects of Upper Limb Home-Based Exergaming Interventions 
      on Activity after Stroke: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
LID - 9112 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19159112 [doi]
AB  - After discharge from the hospital to home, stroke patients may experience
      weakness and reduced movement in their hemiparetic arms that limits their ability
      to perform daily activities. Therapists can use exercise games (exergames) to
      maintain functional abilities and daily use of the arm at home. A systematic
      review and meta-analysis was conducted to determine the efficiency of upper limb 
      home-based rehabilitation, using exergaming on activity abilities in
      stroke.&amp;nbsp;Randomized controlled trials were reviewed in the CENTRAL,
      MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, and SCOPUS online databases. Clinical measures of
      observation and self-reporting were studied in post-intervention and follow-up.
      Nine studies were included in this systematic review (535 participants). The
      Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) score was 6.6/10 (SD 1.0, range 5-8),
      indicating good quality. This systematic review and meta-analysis showed that
      upper limb home-based exergaming interventions were no more effective in terms of
      activity than conventional therapy after stroke, according to the observational
      and subjective assessments in post-intervention and follow-up. Using this same
      approach, future studies should focus on evaluating home-based exergames through 
      subgroup analysis to be able to propose recommendations.

TI  - An Empirical Study on the Influence of Smart Home Interface Design on the
      Interaction Performance of the Elderly.
LID - 9105 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19159105 [doi]
AB  - The concept of the smart home has been widely recognized and accepted, but the
      differentiated characteristics of elderly smart products in terms of demand and
      use are becoming more and more prominent. The lack of an efficient navigation
      design of the smart product interface increases the cognitive burden of elderly
      users, and how to better meet the needs of the elderly with smart products
      gradually becomes the focus of attention. This study was conducted for the
      elderly group, using the scenario-based design method to analyze the needs of
      elderly users, combining the research results of scenario theory with the smart
      home interaction design research method, focusing on how to make the style of
      interface navigation, sliding layout and button size more suitable for the
      cognitive behavior of elderly users. The purpose of this research is to realize
      an age-friendly smart home interaction design in terms of functional design and
      interface design. The experiment is divided into two stages: in stage 1, two
      different layouts and operation methods are commonly used for the age-friendly
      smart home interface: up and down sliding and left and right sliding; in stage 2,
      the functional buttons are square, where 4 styles are selected, and the side
      lengths are set to 10 mm, 12 mm, 15 mm, 18 mm and 22 mm. The sliding and
      retrieval test and retrieval and click test results show that for different
      sliding layout methods, the interactive performance and subjective evaluation of 
      the interface with the up-and-down sliding layout are better. Among all
      functional button styles, the interaction performance and subjective evaluation
      of the simple button style with lines are the best. Among the function keys with 
      a size of 10-22 mm, the interaction performance is better from 12 mm to 18 mm.
      The conclusion of the better interface data information obtained from this
      experiment improves the rationality of the age-friendly smart home interface and 
      makes the smart home interface better for the age-friendly scenario.

TI  - The Effect of Endurance Training on Pulmonary V O2 Kinetics in Solid Organs
      Transplanted Recipients.
LID - 9097 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19159097 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We investigated the effects of single (SL-ET) and double leg (DL-ET) 
      high-intensity interval training on O2 deficit (O2Def) and mean response time
      (MRT) during square-wave moderate-intensity exercise (DL-MOD), and on the
      amplitude of V O2p slow component (SCamp), during heavy intensity exercise
      (DL-HVY), on 33 patients (heart transplant = 13, kidney transplanted = 11 and
      liver transplanted = 9). METHODS: Patients performed DL incremental step exercise
      to exhaustion, two DL-MOD tests, and a DL-HVY trial before and after 24 sessions 
      of SL-ET (n = 17) or DL-ET (n = 16). RESULTS: After SL-ET, O2Def, MRT and SCamp
      decreased by 16.4% +/- 13.7 (p = 0.008), by 15.6% +/- 13.7 (p = 0.004) and by 35%
      +/- 31 (p = 0.002), respectively. After DL-ET, they dropped by 24.9% +/- 16.2 (p 
      &lt; 0.0001), by 25.9% +/- 13.6 (p &lt; 0.0001) and by 38% +/- 52 (p = 0.0003),
      respectively. The magnitude of improvement of O2Def, MRT, and SCamp was not
      significantly different between SL-ET and DL-ET after training. CONCLUSIONS: We
      conclude that SL-ET is as effective as DL-ET if we aim to improve V O2p kinetics 
      in transplanted patients and suggest that the slower, V O2p kinetics is mainly
      caused by the impairment of peripherals exchanges likely due to the
      immunosuppressive medications and disuse.

AB  - The present study aims to provide evidence on the effects of pandemic curtailment
      measures on public health, targeting the changes in breathable air quality,
      within urban areas. The analyzed period covers the full impact of lockdowns in
      Europe in 2020. We used everyday data for each analyzed pollutant, NO2, SO2, CO, 
      PM2.5 and PM10, from urban monitoring stations that provided real-time
      concentrations (provided by Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service,
      Environmental Protection Agency repository and European Environment Agency map
      services) and satellite data (provided by NASA Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2). In
      the present study, the urban air quality was computed using a composite index
      that was further analyzed in comparison with pandemic restrictions. Descriptive
      statistics, charts and maps were used to visualize the data that covered the
      analyzed countries. Our results show that air pollution was reduced by 12% after 
      lockdowns in European urban areas, with a 0.76 correlation between air pollution 
      and pandemic restrictions. All air pollutants registered significant drops.

LID - 10.3390/ijerph19159020 [doi]
AB  - Direct-absorption anaerobic reactors can maintain the fermentation process of
      microorganisms by utilizing solar absorption and scattering media in the biogas
      reactor to improve the slurry temperature. Direct-absorption heating alone can
      save the corresponding electric energy and ensure the normal fermentation process
      of the biogas slurry in the reactor, but there is still the problem of
      temperature fluctuation. In order to improve the stability of the fermentation
      process, it is proposed to optimize the design of this kind of reactor by adding 
      paraffin phase change material. This article mainly studies the influence of
      paraffin phase change material added on the top and side of the reactor in the
      fermentation process and gives the corresponding design parameters for different 
      climatic conditions, which lays a theoretical reference for the design process of
      this kind of reactor.

TI  - Movement Pandemic Adaptability: Health Inequity and Advocacy among Latinx
      Immigrant and Indigenous Peoples.
LID - 8981 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19158981 [doi]
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated longstanding inequities in resources and
      healthcare, stacked on top of historical systems that exploit immigrants and
      communities of color. The range of relief, mutual aid, and advocacy responses to 
      the pandemic highlights the role of social movement organizations in addressing
      the ways that immigration status creates systemic barriers to adequate health and
      wellbeing. This paper conceptualizes what I call, "movement pandemic
      adaptability," drawing from a decolonial-inspired study including
      participant-observation (September 2018-September 2020), interviews (n = 31), and
      focus groups (n = 12) with community members and health advocates. Data
      collection began before the COVID-19 pandemic (September 2018-February 2019) and 
      continued during its emergence and the initial shelter-in-place orders (March
      2019-September 2020). Movement pandemic adaptability emerged as a strategy of
      drawing from pre-existing networks and solidarities to provide culturally
      relevant resources for resilience that addressed vulnerabilities created by
      restrictions against undocumented people and language barriers for communities
      that speak Spanish and a range of Indigenous languages. This paper presents how
      the relationship between immigration status and health is influenced by the local
      context, as well as the decisions of advocates, policymakers, and community
      members.

      Africa: A Workshop Report.
LID - 8973 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19158973 [doi]
AB  - Despite the fact that several cases of unsafe pesticide use among farmers in
      different parts of Africa have been documented, there is limited evidence
      regarding which specific interventions are effective in reducing pesticide
      exposure and associated risks to human health and ecology. The overall goal of
      the African Pesticide Intervention Project&amp;nbsp;(APsent) study is to better
      understand ongoing research and public health activities related to interventions
      in Africa through the implementation of suitable target-specific situations or
      use contexts. A systematic review of the scientific literature on pesticide
      intervention studies with a focus on Africa was conducted. This was followed by a
      qualitative survey among stakeholders involved in pesticide research or
      management in the African region to learn about barriers to and promoters of
      successful interventions. The project was concluded with an international
      workshop in November 2021, where a broad range of topics relevant to occupational
      and environmental health risks were discussed such as acute poisoning, street
      pesticides, switching to alternatives, or disposal of empty pesticide containers.
      Key areas of improvement identified were training on pesticide usage techniques, 
      research on the effectiveness of interventions targeted at exposure reduction
      and/or behavioral changes, awareness raising, implementation of adequate
      policies, and enforcement of regulations and processes.

LID - 10.3390/ijerph19158971 [doi]
AB  - This bibliographic review analyses the utility for psychologists of using
      neuroimaging tests and psychological or neuropsychological tests at the same time
      for studying the functioning of the brain in male abusers condemned for intimate 
      partner violence against women (IPVAW). So as to be able to find an answer, we
      reviewed the available studies that investigated the structure or functioning of 
      the brain. The results of these reviewed works of research show the benefits of
      using neuroimaging applied to male abusers, together with the use, either
      simultaneously or not, of other types of psychological, neuropsychological, or
      observational tests to complement and/or amplify the results of the neuroimaging 
      techniques, as this can help us to advance in the knowledge of neuroscience as
      concerns the mind of the male abuser.

TI  - Beyond Screen Time: Exploring the Associations between Types of Smartphone Use
      Content and Adolescents' Social Relationships.
LID - 8940 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19158940 [doi]
AB  - The past two decades have witnessed controversy over whether the use of digital
      technology has damaged or enhanced adolescents' social relationships, which
      influences their development. In this study, we addressed this debate by
      specifying the effect of different types of smartphone use content on social
      relationships, rather than simply relying on screen time spent on digital media. 
      To avoid selective analysis and report of different variables, we used
      specification curve analysis (SCA) in a large dataset (N = 46,018) to explore the
      correlations between 20 types of smartphone use content and adolescents' social
      relationships (parent-child, peer, and teacher-student). The types of smartphone 
      use content were measured by the revised version of Mobile Phone Use Pattern
      Scale, the Parent-Child Relationship Scale, the Peer Relationship Scale, and the 
      Teacher-Student Relationship Scale assessed three different social relationships,
      respectively. Of the 20 types of smartphone use content, only playing games
      (negatively explaining 1% of the variation), taking online courses (positively
      explaining 1.6% of the variation), using search engines (positively explaining
      1.2% of the variation), using a dictionary (positively explaining 1.3% of the
      variation), and obtaining life information (positively explaining 1.5% of the
      variation) showed a significant effect size. The association between smartphone
      use and adolescents' social relationships depends on the various types of content
      with which adolescents engage during smartphone use. The various effects of
      different types of smartphone use content deserve the attention of both the
      public and policy-makers.

TI  - Invisible Effect of Virtual Water Transfer on Water Quantity Conflict in
      Transboundary Rivers-Taking Ili River as a Case.
LID - 8917 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19158917 [doi]
AB  - Water stress in countries within a drainage basin exacerbates the water quantity 
      conflict in transboundary rivers. However, few studies considered the invisible
      effect of virtual water transfer on water quantity conflict by intensifying water
      stress. Therefore, this study, with Ili River as the case, collects data on
      Virtual Water Trade (VWT) from 1990 to 2015, uses water stress index (WSI) to
      assess water stress values under two scenarios (with or without virtual water
      transfer), and takes Grey Verhulst Model to predict two scenarios water stress
      values respectively. Next, based on the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) Algorithm, this 
      study compares the water quantity conflict intensity of the two scenarios, and
      further explores the invisible effect of virtual water transfer on the conflicts 
      among transboundary rivers. Results show: (1) During the study period
      (1990-2015), water stress in China and Kazakhstan along the banks of Ili River
      increased in general. (2) China was basically a net exporter of virtual water
      during 1990-1995, and Kazakhstan became a net exporter after 1995. (3) During
      2020-2025, water conflict value of Ili River without virtual water transfer is
      0.458, while the value rises to 0.622 with virtual water transfer, indicating
      that virtual water transfer between China and Kazakhstan has an invisible
      enhancement on the water quantity conflict of Ili River. (4) The intensified
      water quantity conflict is mainly caused by the more and more serious water
      stress in Kazakhstan. On such basis, it is more urgent for Kazakhstan to
      restructure its economy and trade.

TI  - Individual Workplace Well-Being Captured into a Literature- and
      Stakeholders-Based Causal Loop Diagram.
LID - 8925 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19158925 [doi]
AB  - This study demonstrates an innovative approach to capture the complexity of
      individual workplace well-being, improving our understanding of multicausal
      relationships and feedback loops involved. The literature shows that a high
      number of interacting factors are related to individual workplace well-being.
      However, many studies focus on subsets of factors, and causal loops are seldomly 
      studied. The aim of the current study was, therefore, to capture individual
      workplace well-being in a comprehensive conceptual causal loop diagram (CLD). We 
      followed an iterative, qualitative, and transdisciplinary systems-thinking
      approach including literature search, group model building sessions,
      retrospective in-depth interviews with employees, and group sessions with human
      resource professionals, managers, job coaches, and management consultants. The
      results were discussed with HR and well-being officers of twelve organizations
      for their critical reflection on the recognizability and potential of the
      developed CLD. The final result, a conceptual individual workplace well-being
      CLD, provides a comprehensive overview of multiple, measurable key factors
      relating to individual workplace well-being and of the way these factors may
      causally interact over time, either improving or deteriorating workplace
      well-being. In future studies, the CLD can be translated to a quantitative system
      dynamics model for simulating workplace well-being scenarios. Ultimately, these
      simulations could be used to design effective workplace well-being interventions.

TI  - Why Employees Experience Burnout: An Explanation of Illegitimate Tasks.
LID - 8923 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19158923 [doi]
AB  - Among the many workplace stressors, a new type of stressor has been identified:
      illegitimate tasks. This newly identified type of stressor refers to work tasks
      that do not meet employee role expectations and constitute a violation of
      professional identity. To investigate illegitimate tasks' mediating mechanisms
      and boundary conditions on job burnout, we examined a cross-level first-stage
      moderated mediation model with the collective climate as a moderator and
      psychological entitlement as a mediator. Grounded in the job demands-resources
      model (JD-R) and justice theory, the current study uniquely posits that
      illegitimate tasks can lead to burnout by way of psychological entitlement;
      however, this effect is less where collective climate is higher. Data were
      collected from 459 employees on 89 teams at enterprises in China. The results of 
      the analysis, using HLM, MPLUS and SPSS revealed that illegitimate tasks
      stimulated employees' psychological entitlement and led to job burnout. While
      employees' psychological entitlement played a partially mediating role between
      illegitimate tasks and job burnout, a collective climate could weaken the
      stimulating effect of illegitimate tasks on employees' psychological entitlement 
      and then negatively affect the mediating effect of psychological entitlement
      between illegitimate tasks and burnout. The study reveals the antecedents of
      burnout from the perspective of job tasks and psychological entitlement, offers
      practical insight into the mechanism of illegitimate tasks on employee job
      burnout and recommends that organizations develop a collective climate to reduce 
      employees' psychological entitlement and job burnout for steady development of
      the enterprise.

TI  - Spatial Video and EpiExplorer: A Field Strategy to Contextualize Enteric Disease 
      Risk in Slum Environments.
LID - 8902 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19158902 [doi]
AB  - Disease risk associated with contaminated water, poor sanitation, and hygiene in 
      informal settlement environments is conceptually well understood. From an
      analytical perspective, collecting data at a suitably fine scale spatial and
      temporal granularity is challenging. Novel mobile methodologies, such as spatial 
      video (SV), can complement more traditional epidemiological field work to address
      this gap. However, this work then poses additional challenges in terms of
      analytical visualizations that can be used to both understand sub-neighborhood
      patterns of risk, and even provide an early warning system. In this paper, we use
      bespoke spatial programming to create a framework for flexible, fine-scale
      exploratory investigations of simultaneously-collected water quality and
      environmental surveys in three different informal settlements of Port-au-Prince, 
      Haiti. We dynamically mine these spatio-temporal epidemiological and
      environmental data to provide insights not easily achievable using more
      traditional spatial software, such as Geographic Information System (GIS). The
      results include sub-neighborhood maps of localized risk that vary monthly. Most
      interestingly, some of these epidemiological variations might have previously
      been erroneously explained because of proximate environmental factors and/or
      meteorological conditions.

TI  - The Seroprevalence and Hidden Burden of Chikungunya Endemicity and Malaria Mono- 
      and Coinfection in Nigeria.
LID - 8896 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19158896 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mosquito-borne infections are of global health concern because of
      their rapid spread and upsurge, which creates a risk for coinfections.
      Chikungunya, an arbovirus disease transmitted by Aedes aegypti or
      A.&amp;nbsp;albopictus, and malaria, a parasitic disease transmitted by Anopheles
      gambiae, are prevalent in Nigeria and neighbouring countries, but their burden
      and possible coinfections are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated
      the seroprevalence, hidden burden and endemicity of chikungunya and malaria in
      three regions in Nigeria. METHODS: A cross-sectional sero-survey was conducted on
      871 participants in three regions of Nigeria. The samples were collected from
      outpatients employing simple random sampling. All serum sample analyses were
      performed using CHIKV virus-like particle recomLine Tropical Fever for the
      presence of arboviral antibody serological marker IgG immunoblot for chikungunya 
      and malaria RDT (Rapid Diagnostic Test) for malaria parasites. RESULTS: The
      seroprevalences of chikungunya and malaria mono-infection were 64.9% and 27.7%,
      respectively, while the coinfection seroprevalence was 71.9%. The central (69.5%)
      and northern (67.0%) regions showed more significant seroprevalences than the
      southern region (48.0%). The seroprevalence and the hidden burden of chikungunya 
      and malaria infections varied across the three geographical regions. CONCLUSIONS:
      This study highlighted an unexpectedly high seroprevalence and hidden endemicity 
      of chikungunya and a less surprising high malaria endemicity in three regions of 
      Nigeria.

TI  - The role of liver kinase B1 in tumor progression through regulation of lipid
      metabolism.
LID - 10.1007/s12094-022-02863-2 [doi]
AB  - The somatic mutation of liver kinase B1 (LKB1) has been implicated in various
      tumors, which is reflected in the survival, proliferation, and metastasis of
      tumor cells. However, the regulation of LKB1 in lipid metabolism, a process that 
      is involved in tumor progression is not completely clear. We conclude that LKB1
      deficiency results in abnormal expression and activation of multiple molecules
      related to lipid metabolism which locate downstream of AMP-activated protein
      kinase (AMPK) or salt-induced kinase (SIK). Abnormal lipid metabolism induced by 
      LKB1 deficiency contributes to the proliferation and metastasis of tumor cells
      through energy regulation.

TI  - Therapeutic effects of isosteviol sodium on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease by 
      regulating autophagy via Sirt1/AMPK pathway.
PG  - 12857
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-16119-0 [doi]
AB  - Isosteviol sodium (STVNa) is a beyerane diterpene synthesized via acid hydrolysis
      of stevioside, which can improve glucose and lipid metabolism in animals with
      diabetes. However, it remains unknown whether STVNa can exhibit a therapeutic
      effect on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its underlying mechanism. 
      We hypothesize that autophagic initiation may play a key role in mediating the
      development of NAFLD. Herein, we assessed the effects of STVNa on NAFLD and its
      underlying mechanisms. The results demonstrated that STVNa treatment effectively 
      ameliorated NAFLD in rats fed high-fat diet (HFD). Moreover, STVNa decreased the 
      expression of inflammation-related genes and maintained a balance of
      pro-inflammatory cytokines in NAFLD rats. STVNa also reduced lipid accumulation
      in free fatty acid (FFA)-exposed LO2 cells. In addition, STVNa attenuated hepatic
      oxidative stress and fibrosis in NAFLD rats. Furthermore, STVNa enhanced
      autophagy and activated Sirtuin 1/adenosine monophosphate-activated protein
      kinase (Sirt1/AMPK) pathway both in vivo and in vitro, thus attenuating
      intracellular lipid accumulation. In summary, STVNa could improve lipid
      metabolism in NAFLD by initiating autophagy via Sirt1/AMPK pathway. Therefore,
      STVNa may be an alternative therapeutic agent for treatment of NAFLD.

AB  - Recent advances in fluorescence microscopy techniques and tissue clearing,
      labeling, and staining provide unprecedented opportunities to investigate brain
      structure and function. These experiments' images make it possible to catalog
      brain cell types and define their location, morphology, and connectivity in a
      native context, leading to a better understanding of normal development and
      disease etiology. Consistent annotation of metadata is needed to provide the
      context necessary to understand, reuse, and integrate these data. This report
      describes an effort to establish metadata standards for three-dimensional (3D)
      microscopy datasets for use by the Brain Research through Advancing Innovative
      Neurotechnologies(R) (BRAIN) Initiative and the neuroscience research community. 
      These standards were built on existing efforts and developed with input from the 
      brain microscopy community to promote adoption. The resulting 3D Microscopy
      Metadata Standards (3D-MMS) includes 91 fields organized into seven categories:
      Contributors, Funders, Publication, Instrument, Dataset, Specimen, and Image.
      Adoption of these metadata standards will ensure that investigators receive
      credit for their work, promote data reuse, facilitate downstream analysis of
      shared data, and encourage collaboration.

TI  - Rare loss of function variants in the hepatokine gene INHBE protect from
      abdominal obesity.
PG  - 4319
LID - 10.1038/s41467-022-31757-8 [doi]
AB  - Identifying genetic variants associated with lower waist-to-hip ratio can reveal 
      new therapeutic targets for abdominal obesity. We use exome sequences from
      362,679 individuals to identify genes associated with waist-to-hip ratio adjusted
      for BMI (WHRadjBMI), a surrogate for abdominal fat that is causally linked to
      type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease. Predicted loss of function (pLOF)
      variants in INHBE associate with lower WHRadjBMI and this association replicates 
      in data from AMP-T2D-GENES. INHBE encodes a secreted protein, the hepatokine
      activin E. In vitro characterization of the most common INHBE pLOF variant in our
      study, indicates an in-frame deletion resulting in a 90% reduction in secreted
      protein levels. We detect associations with lower WHRadjBMI for variants in
      ACVR1C, encoding an activin receptor, further highlighting the involvement of
      activins in regulating fat distribution. These findings highlight activin E as a 
      potential therapeutic target for abdominal obesity, a phenotype linked to
      cardiometabolic disease.

TI  - Impact of Goreisan upon aquaporin-2-incorporated aquaresis system in patients
      with congestive heart failure.
LID - 10.1007/s13730-022-00723-0 [doi]
AB  - We often encounter patients with congestive heart failure refractory to
      conventional diuretics therapy, and Kampo Goreisan is receiving great concern to 
      mediate body water balance particularly for such a cohort. However, its detailed 
      biological mechanism remains uncertain. We had two hospitalized patients with
      congestive heart failure receiving tolvaptan. Following the administration of
      Goreisan, both urine cyclic adenosine monophosphate concentration and urine
      aquaporin-2 concentration decreased, accompanied by incremental diluted urine
      volume. Although further studies are warranted to establish therapeutic strategy,
      Goreisan might be a promising therapeutic tool for those with congestive heart
      failure refractory to conventional diuretics including tolvaptan, via pleiotropic
      effects including suppression of aquaporin-incorporated water reabsorption
      system.

TI  - Bendiocarb and Malathion Resistance in Two Major Malaria Vector Populations in
      Cameroon Is Associated with High Frequency of the G119S Mutation (Ace-1) and
      Overexpression of Detoxification Genes.
LID - 824 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pathogens11080824 [doi]
AB  - The spread of pyrethroid resistance in malaria vectors is a major threat
      affecting the performance of current control measures. However, there is still
      not enough information on the resistance profile of mosquitoes to carbamates and 
      organophosphates which could be used as alternatives. The present study assessed 
      the resistance profile of Anopheles gambiae s.l. to bendiocarb and malathion, at 
      the phenotypic and molecular levels, in different eco-epidemiological settings in
      Cameroon. Anopheles gambiae s.l. mosquitoes were collected from four
      eco-epidemiological settings across the country and their susceptibility level to
      bendiocarb and malathion was determined using WHO tubes bioassays. The ace-1
      target site G119S mutation was screened by PCR. Reverse Transcription
      quantitative PCR 3-plex TaqMan assays were used to quantify the level of
      expression of eight genes associated with metabolic resistance. Resistance to
      malathion and/or bendiocarb was recorded in all study sites except in mosquitoes 
      collected in Kaele and Njombe. The Ace-1 (G119S) mutation was detected in high
      frequencies (&gt;40%) in Kekem and Santchou. Both An. gambiae and An. coluzzii
      were detected carrying this mutation. The cytochrome P450s gene Cyp6p3 associated
      with carbamate resistance and the glutathione S-transferase gene Gste2 associated
      with organophosphate resistance were found to be overexpressed. Genes associated 
      with pyrethroid (Cyp6m2, Cyp9k1, Cyp6p3) and organochlorine (Gste2, Cyp6z1,
      Cyp6m2) and cuticle resistance (Cyp4g16) were also overexpressed. The rapid
      spread of resistance to organophosphates and carbamates could seriously
      compromise future control strategies based on IRS. It is therefore becoming
      important to assess the magnitude of bendiocarb and malathion resistance
      countrywide.

TI  - Deep Learning-Based Segmentation of Post-Mortem Human's Olfactory Bulb Structures
      in X-ray Phase-Contrast Tomography.
PG  - 1854-1868
LID - 10.3390/tomography8040156 [doi]
AB  - The human olfactory bulb (OB) has a laminar structure. The segregation of cell
      populations in the OB image poses a significant challenge because of indistinct
      boundaries of the layers. Standard 3D visualization tools usually have a low
      resolution and cannot provide the high accuracy required for morphometric
      analysis. X-ray phase contrast tomography (XPCT) offers sufficient resolution and
      contrast to identify single cells in large volumes of the brain. The numerous
      microanatomical structures detectable in XPCT image of the OB, however, greatly
      complicate the manual delineation of OB neuronal cell layers. To address the
      challenging problem of fully automated segmentation of XPCT images of human OB
      morphological layers, we propose a new pipeline for tomographic data processing. 
      Convolutional neural networks (CNN) were used to segment XPCT image of native
      unstained human OB. Virtual segmentation of the whole OB and an accurate
      delineation of each layer in a healthy non-demented OB is mandatory as the first 
      step for assessing OB morphological changes in smell impairment research. In this
      framework, we proposed an effective tool that could help to shed light on OB
      layer-specific degeneration in patients with olfactory disorder.

TI  - Parylene C as an Insulating Polymer for Implantable Neural Interfaces: Acute
      Electrochemical Impedance Behaviors in Saline and Pig Brain In Vitro.
LID - 3033 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/polym14153033 [doi]
AB  - Parylene is used as encapsulating material for medical devices due to its
      excellent biocompatibility and insulativity. Its performance as the insulating
      polymer of implantable neural interfaces has been studied in electrolyte
      solutions and in vivo. Biological tissue in vitro, as a potential environment for
      characterization and application, is convenient to access in the fabrication lab 
      of polymer and neural electrodes, but there has been little study investigating
      the behaviors of Parylene in the tissue in vitro. Here, we investigated the
      electrochemical impedance behaviors of Parylene C polymer coating both in normal 
      saline and in a chilled pig brain in vitro by performing electrochemical
      impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements of platinum (Pt) wire neural
      electrodes. The electrochemical impedance at the representative frequencies is
      discussed, which helps to construct the equivalent circuit model. Statistical
      analysis of fitted parameters of the equivalent circuit model showed good
      reliability of Parylene C as an insulating polymer in both electrolyte models.
      The electrochemical impedance measured in pig brain in vitro shows marked
      differences from that of saline.

TI  - Structural Exploration on Palmitoyltransferase DHHC3 from Homo sapiens.
LID - 3013 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/polym14153013 [doi]
AB  - DHHC3 belongs to a family of DHHC palmitoyltransferase, which catalyzes the
      S-palmitoylation of target proteins by attaching a fatty acyl group to a
      cysteine. Recently, DHHC3 has been demonstrated to be a promising antitumor
      target in cancer therapeutics. However, the detailed structure and catalysis
      mechanism of DHHC3 remain elusive, considering its sequence diversity from the
      DHHC homologues with known crystal structures. Here, we described the expression 
      and purification of human DHHC3 (hDHHC3) and truncated hDHHC3 with the flexible
      N-terminal domain (NTD) removed. Purified hDHHC3 proteins were used under various
      conditions for protein crystallization. LAMTOR1, one of the interacting proteins 
      of hDHHC3 to facilitate the crystallization, was further identified by mass
      spectrometry and co-immunoprecipitation assay. The structural exploration using
      cryogenic electronic microscopy (cryo-EM) on the inactive hDHHS3 mutant showed a 
      typical sideview of membrane proteins. These results provide a preliminary
      guidance for the structural determination of DHHC3.

TI  - Innovative Coating-Etching Method of Biocarrier Fabrication for Treating
      Wastewater with a Low C/N Ratio.
LID - 3010 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/polym14153010 [doi]
AB  - A novel method was used to fabricate the bio-carrier with both a high specific
      surface area and good compatibility. The results of monitoring the growth of
      biofilms at a low C/N ratio (0.83) showed that resulting carrier-PLA-cavity
      offered certain advantages for biofilm growth by providing an appropriate
      microenvironment for bacterial growth in wastewater treatment. The biofilm on
      carrier-PLA-cavity grew and updated faster than the naked-carrier. The biomass
      and thickness of biofilms growing on carrier-PLA-cavity were 10 kg/m(3) and 500
      mum, respectively. From the wastewater tests, 90% of the total nitrogen was
      removed via simultaneous nitrification and denitrification (SND) by the biofilm
      biomass attached to carrier-PLA-cavity, compared to 68% for the naked-carrier.
      The COD removal efficiency values of the carrier-PLA-cavity and naked-carrier
      were 94% and 86%, respectively. The microbial community analysis of carrier
      biofilms showed that Halomonas was the most abundant genus, and heterotrophic
      nitrification and denitrification were responsible for nitrogen removal in both
      reactors. Notably, this method does not require any complicated equipment or
      structural design. This novel method might be a promising strategy for
      fabricating biocarriers for treating wastewater with a low C/N ratio.

TI  - Characteristics of Water Transport of Membrane Electrolyte over Selected
      Temperature for Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell.
LID - 2972 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/polym14152972 [doi]
AB  - The water contents at both the anode and cathode of PEMFCs depend on the
      water-transport mechanism at the membrane. The humidity at the outside layers of 
      the membrane determines the diffusion of water through it. The operating
      temperatures and pressures regulate the humidity conditions in the system.
      Because these parameters are nonlinear, the water-transport mechanism is analyzed
      via the difference in the water concentration on each side of the membrane. In
      this work, an experimental configuration is designed to investigate the diffusion
      mechanism of water through the membrane. A flat membrane module is tested in an
      isothermal test chamber to test the influence of temperature on the
      water-absorption and -transport characteristics of Nafion 117 and Nafion 211
      membranes. A parametric study is conducted to test the water-transport mechanism 
      at an operating pressure of 1 bar; temperatures of 30 degrees C, 50 degrees C, 70
      degrees C and 90 degrees C; and a relative humidity ranging from 10% to 100%. The
      results indicate that the water content of Nafion 211 is higher than that of
      Nafion 117. The water content and diffusion coefficient are proportional to the
      operating temperature. In addition, the diffusion coefficient reaches its peak at
      conditions of 1 bar, 100% humidity, and 90 degrees C for both membrane types.

TI  - The Extent of Lifestyle-Induced Weight Loss Determines the Risk of Prediabetes
      and Metabolic Syndrome Recurrence during a 5-Year Follow-Up.
LID - 3060 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14153060 [doi]
AB  - It is controversial whether lifestyle-induced weight loss (LIWL) intervention
      provides long-term benefit. Here, we investigated whether the degree of weight
      loss (WL) in a controlled LIWL intervention study determined the risk of
      prediabetes and recurrence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) during a 5-year
      follow-up. Following LIWL, 58 male participants (age 45-55 years) were divided
      into four quartiles based on initial WL: Q1 (WL 0-8.1%, n = 15), Q2 (WL
      8.1-12.8%, n = 14), Q3 (WL 12.8-16.0%, n = 14), and Q4 (WL 16.0-27.5%, n = 15).
      We analyzed changes in BMI, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides (TGs), blood pressure,
      and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) at annual follow-up visits. With a weight gain
      after LIWL between 1.2 (Q2) and 2.5 kg/year (Q4), the reduction in BMI was
      maintained for 4 (Q2, p = 0.03) or 5 (Q3, p = 0.03; Q4, p &lt; 0.01) years,
      respectively, and an increase in FPG levels above baseline values was prevented
      in Q2-Q4. Accordingly, there was no increase in prediabetes incidence after LIWL 
      in participants in Q2 (up to 2 years), Q3 and Q4 (up to 5 years). A sustained
      reduction in MetS was maintained in Q4 during the 5-year follow-up. The present
      data indicate that a greater initial LIWL reduces the risk of prediabetes and
      recurrence of MetS for up to 5 years.

TI  - The Effect of Laminaria japonica on Metabolic Syndrome: A Systematic Review of
      Its Efficacy and Mechanism of Action.
LID - 3046 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14153046 [doi]
AB  - Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a medical condition characterized by abdominal
      obesity, insulin resistance, high blood pressure, and hyperlipidemia. An increase
      in the incidence of MetS provokes an escalation in health care costs and a
      downturn in quality of life. However, there is currently no cure for MetS, and
      the absence of immediate treatment for MetS has prompted the development of novel
      therapies. In accordance with recent studies, the brown seaweed Laminaria
      japonica (LJP) has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, and so forth.
      LJP contains bioactive compounds used as food globally, and it has been used as a
      medicine in East Asian countries. We conducted a systematic review to examine
      whether LJP could potentially be a useful therapeutic drug for MetS. The
      following databases were searched from initiation to September 2021: PubMed, Web 
      of Science, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials Library.
      Clinical trials and in vivo studies evaluating the effects of LJP on MetS were
      included. LJP reduces the oxidative stress-related lipid mechanisms, inflammatory
      cytokines and macrophage-related chemokines, muscle cell proliferation, and
      migration. Bioactive-glucosidase inhibitors reduce diabetic complications, a
      therapeutic target in obesity and type 2 diabetes. In obesity, LJP increases
      AMP-activated protein kinase and decreases acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Based on our
      findings, we suggest that LJP could treat MetS, as it has pharmacological effects
      on MetS.

TI  - Ginsenoside Rh4 Suppresses Metastasis of Esophageal Cancer and Expression of
      c-Myc via Targeting the Wnt/beta-Catenin Signaling Pathway.
LID - 3042 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14153042 [doi]
AB  - The metastasis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a leading cause of
      death worldwide, however, it has a poor prognosis. Ginsenoside Rh4 is a rare
      saponin that has been shown to have potential antitumor effectiveness in ESCC.
      However, the utility of Rh4 in ESCC metastasis and its undiscovered mode of
      action has not yet been explored. In this study, we found that Rh4 could inhibit 
      ESCC metastasis by regulating the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway and the
      level of c-Myc, which is an important transcription factor in cancer. In in vitro
      experiments, Rh4 could inhibit the migration and invasion of ESCC cells without
      affecting cell viability. In in vivo experiments, Rh4 restrained ESCC metastasis 
      to the lymph nodes and lungs via the suppression of epithelial-mesenchymal
      transition (EMT). The Wnt agonist HLY78 promoted EMT and migration of ESCC cells,
      whereas treatment of Rh4 can attenuate the promotion effect of HLY78. The siRNA
      knocking out c-Myc can also significantly reduce the expression of EMT-related
      marker proteins. This study illustrates a new concept for further research on the
      mechanism of Rh4 in ESCC.

TI  - Dyslipidaemia Is Associated with Severe Disease Activity and Poor Prognosis in
      Ulcerative Colitis: A Retrospective Cohort Study in China.
LID - 3040 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14153040 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical data on the correlation of dyslipidaemia with the long-term 
      outcomes of ulcerative colitis (UC) are limited. This study aimed to evaluate the
      impact of lipid levels on disease activity and prognosis in UC. METHODS: The
      retrospective data of UC patients who had detailed lipid profiles were collected 
      from January 2003 to September 2020. All patients were followed-up to 30
      September 2021. The long-term outcomes were UC-related surgery and tumorigenesis.
      RESULTS: In total, 497 patients were included in the analysis. Compared to
      patients with normal lipid levels, those with dyslipidaemia commonly presented
      with more serious disease activity. Low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p
      &lt; 0.05) levels were associated with higher risks of severe disease activity in
      UC. Regarding the long-term outcomes, patients with persistent dyslipidaemia were
      at higher risks of UC-related surgery (HR: 3.27, 95% CI: 1.86-5.75, p &lt; 0.001)
      and tumorigenesis (HR: 7.92, 95% CI: 3.97-15.78, p &lt; 0.001) and had shorter
      surgery- and tumour-free survival (p &lt; 0.001) than patients with transient
      dyslipidaemia and normal lipid levels. Low levels of high-density lipoprotein
      cholesterol (p &lt; 0.001) and apolipoprotein A1 (p &lt; 0.05) were associated
      with higher risks of surgery and tumorigenesis. CONCLUSION: Persistent
      dyslipidaemia was associated with a higher risk of serious disease activity and
      worse long-term outcomes among patients with UC. Lipid patterns should be
      assessed to improve the management of high-risk patients with UC in the early
      phase.

TI  - Phase Angle, a Cornerstone of Outcome in Head and Neck Cancer.
LID - 3030 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14153030 [doi]
AB  - In patients with head and neck cancer, malnutrition is common. Most cases are
      treated by chemo-radiotherapy and surgery, with adverse effects on the
      aerodigestive area. Clinical and biochemical characteristics, health-related
      quality of life, survival, and risk of death were studied. The selected subjects 
      were divided into normal- and low-phase-angle (PA) groups and followed up for at 
      least two years. Mean ages were 67.2 and 59.3 years for low and normal PA,
      respectively. Patients with PA &lt; 4.42 degrees had significant differences in
      age, anthropometric and biochemical indicators of malnutrition, and inflammatory 
      status compared to patients with PA &gt; 4.42 degrees . Statistical differences
      were found in the functional and symptom scales, with lower functional scores and
      higher symptom scores in patients with low PA. Median survival was 19.8 months
      for those with PA &lt; 4.42 degrees versus 34.4 months for those with PA &gt;
      4.42 degrees (p &lt; 0.001).The relative risk of death was related to low PA
      (2.6; p &lt; 0.001). The percentage of living patients (41.7%) is almost the same
      as the percentage of deceased subjects (43.1%; p = 0.002), with high death rates 
      in patients with PA &lt; 4.42 degrees . Phase angle was the most crucial
      predictor of survival and a risk factor for death in the studied cases.

TI  - Impact of Time-Restricted Feeding on Adaptation to a 6-Hour Delay Phase Shift or 
      a 12-Hour Phase Shift in Mice.
LID - 3025 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14153025 [doi]
AB  - Nowadays, more and more people are suffering from circadian disruption. However, 
      there is no well-accepted treatment. Recently, time-restricted feeding (TRF) was 
      proposed as a potential non-drug intervention to alleviate jet lag in mice,
      especially in mice treated with a 6-h advanced phase shift. Here, we challenged
      C57BL/6 mice with a 6-h delay phase shift or a 12-h shift (day-night reversal)
      combined with 6- or 12-h TRF within the dark phase and found the beneficial
      effects of given TRF strategies in certain phase-shifting situations. Although
      behavioral fitness did not correlate well with health status, none of the TRF
      strategies we used deteriorated lipopolysaccharide-induced sepsis. These findings
      improve our understanding of the benefits of TRF for adaptation to circadian
      disruption.

TI  - mTORC1 and mTORC2 Complexes Regulate the Untargeted Metabolomics and Amino Acid
      Metabolites Profile through Mitochondrial Bioenergetic Functions in Pancreatic
      Beta Cells.
LID - 3022 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14153022 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pancreatic beta cells regulate bioenergetics efficiency and secret
      insulin in response to glucose and nutrient availability. The mechanistic Target 
      of Rapamycin (mTOR) network orchestrates pancreatic progenitor cell growth and
      metabolism by nucleating two complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. OBJECTIVE: To
      determine the impact of mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibition on amino acid metabolism in
      mouse pancreatic beta cells (Beta-TC-6 cells, ATCC-CRL-11506) using
      high-resolution metabolomics (HRM) and live-mitochondrial functions. METHODS:
      Pancreatic beta TC-6 cells were incubated for 24 h with either: RapaLink-1 (RL); 
      Torin-2 (T); rapamycin (R); metformin (M); a combination of RapaLink-1 and
      metformin (RLM); Torin-2 and metformin (TM); compared to the control. We applied 
      high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) LC-MS/MS untargeted metabolomics to
      compare the twenty natural amino acid profiles to the control. In addition, we
      quantified the bioenergetics dynamics and cellular metabolism by live-cell
      imaging and the MitoStress Test XF24 (Agilent, Seahorse). The real-time,
      live-cell approach simultaneously measures the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and 
      extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) to determine cellular respiration and
      metabolism. Statistical significance was assessed using ANOVA on Ranks and
      post-hoc Welch t-Tests. RESULTS: RapaLink-1, Torin-2, and rapamycin decreased
      L-aspartate levels compared to the control (p = 0.006). Metformin alone did not
      affect L-aspartate levels. However, L-asparagine levels decreased with all
      treatment groups compared to the control (p = 0.03). On the contrary, L-glutamate
      and glycine levels were reduced only by mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibitors RapaLink-1 and
      Torin-2, but not by rapamycin or metformin. The metabolic activity network model 
      predicted that L-aspartate and AMP interact within the same activity network.
      Live-cell bioenergetics revealed that ATP production was significantly reduced in
      RapaLink-1 (122.23 + 33.19), Torin-2 (72.37 + 17.33) treated cells, compared to
      rapamycin (250.45 + 9.41) and the vehicle control (274.23 + 38.17), p &lt; 0.01. 
      However, non-mitochondrial oxygen consumption was not statistically different
      between RapaLink-1 (67.17 + 3.52), Torin-2 (55.93 + 8.76), or rapamycin (80.01 + 
      4.36, p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Dual mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibition by RapaLink-1 and
      Torin-2 differentially altered the amino acid profile and decreased mitochondrial
      respiration compared to rapamycin treatment which only blocks the FRB domain on
      mTOR. Third-generation mTOR inhibitors may alter the mitochondrial dynamics and
      reveal a bioenergetics profile that could be targeted to reduce mitochondrial
      stress.

TI  - Lower Serum Calcium Levels Associated with Disrupted Sleep and Rest-Activity
      Rhythm in Shift Workers.
LID - 3021 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14153021 [doi]
AB  - Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in many developed countries, and several
      studies suggest that vitamin D plays an essential role in brain function. A
      recent study showed that vitamin D deficiency was closely associated with daytime
      sleepiness and shorter sleep time. The relationshipbetween vitamin D levels and
      calcium levels is well established, and calcium level regulates slow-wave sleep
      generation. It is conceivable that the sleep disturbance in vitamin D deficiency 
      may be due to an altered calcium level. Nonetheless, calcium levels, sleep
      disturbances, and activity rhythms have not been investigated directly.
      Therefore, we hypothesized that calcium and vitamin D levels might be important
      in regulating sleep and activity rhythm, and we analyzed the correlation with
      calcium levels by actigraphy analysis. Interestingly, a negative correlation was 
      found between calcium level and sleep latency, total sleep time, use of sleep
      medicine, and daytime dysfunction among shift workers. In contrast, non-shift
      workers showed a negative correlation between the calcium level and the circadian
      phase. These findings suggest that low serum calcium levels may disrupt
      sleep-wake control and rest-activity rhythm, even if they are within the normal
      range.

TI  - Itraconazole Nanosuspensions via Dual Centrifugation Media Milling: Impact of
      Formulation and Process Parameters on Particle Size and Solid-State Conversion as
      Well as Storage Stability.
LID - 1528 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics14081528 [doi]
AB  - Nanocrystal suspensions proved to be a potent enabling principle for
      biopharmaceutics classification system class II drugs with dissolution limited
      bioavailability. In the example of itraconazole (ITZ) as a model drug combined
      with electrosteric stabilization using hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC-SL), sodium
      dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and polysorbate 80 (PS80), the impacts of formulation and
      process parameters of a dual centrifugal mill on material attributes such as
      particle size, zeta potential, particle morphology, storage stability and
      especially solid-state characteristics were evaluated. A minimal concentration of
      0.9% (w/w) HPC-SL, 0.14% (w/w) SDS and 0.07% (w/w) PS80 was necessary for
      sufficient nanoparticle stabilization. Despite the minor effect of PS80, its
      presence was beneficial for electrosteric stabilization. Choosing lower
      stabilizer concentrations resulted in a pronounced increase in particle size due 
      to agglomeration, which was confirmed by SEM imaging and a decrease in zeta
      potential in combination with an amorphization of the particles. Milling
      temperature had no significant impact on the particle size, whereas milling speed
      and the size of the milling beads used were found to have a strong impact on the 
      critical material attributes such as particle size and polydispersity index. The 
      smallest particle sizes could be obtained by using the smallest milling bead
      size. However, the smallest obtainable particle size could only be achieved by
      using two-fold stabilizer concentrations, as smaller particles exhibit a larger
      specific surface area.

TI  - Susceptibilities of the Invasive Fall Armyworm (Spodopterafrugiperda) to the
      Insecticidal Proteins of Bt maize in China.
LID - 507 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/toxins14080507 [doi]
AB  - To control the fall armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda (Smith), a serious
      threat to maize production in China, the Chinese government has issued biosafety 
      certificates for transgenic insect-resistant maize expressing Bt (Bacillus
      thuringiensis) toxins including Bt-Cry1Ab maize (crop event DBN9936), Bt-Vip3Aa
      maize (event DBN9501), Bt-(Cry1Ab+Vip3Aa) maize with superimposed traits (event
      DBN9936 x DBN9501) and Bt-(Cry1Ab+Vip3Aa) maize with superimposed traits (event
      Bt11 x MIR162), but the susceptibility baselines of geographically distinct FAW
      populations to these events, which form the basis for managing resistance
      development in the pest to these events, are not clear. We used the
      diet-incorporated bioassays method to detect the susceptibilities of the seven
      FAW populations collected from Yunnan, Henan and Hubei provinces in China in 2021
      to the insecticidal proteins of the four Bt maize events. The result showed that 
      the susceptibilities of different geographical populations to Bt insecticidal
      proteins were significantly different. In the seven populations, the range in
      median lethal concentrations (LC50) of Cry1Ab expressed in DBN9936 was 0.87-2.63 
      mug/g, 0.14-0.30 mug/g for Vip3Aa expressed in DBN9501, 0.78-1.86 mug/g for
      Cry1Ab+Vip3Aa expressed in DBN9936 x DBN9501, and 0.36-1.42 mug/g for
      CryAb+Vip3Aa expressed in Bt11 x MIR162. The growth inhibition responses also
      showed that the susceptibilities varied with the different median growth
      inhibitory concentration (GIC50) ranges (0.38-1.22, 0.08-0.28, 0.28-0.87, and
      0.24-0.78 mug/g, respectively). The variations in the ranges of the
      susceptibility baselines of the geographical populations of fall armyworm in
      China to the insecticidal proteins expressed in the four events provide a
      scientific basis for monitoring FAW population resistance to Bt maize and
      managing the populations using different Bt maize events.

TI  - Fixed-Dose Ultrasound-Assisted Catheter-Directed Thrombolysis for Acute Pulmonary
      Embolism Associated with COVID-19.
LID - 1606 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14081606 [doi]
AB  - Background. Fixed-dose ultrasound-assisted catheter-directed thrombolysis (USAT) 
      rapidly improves hemodynamic parameters and reverses right ventricular
      dysfunction caused by acute pulmonary embolism (PE). The effectiveness of USAT
      for acute PE associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is unknown.
      Methods and results. The study population of this cohort study consisted of 36
      patients with an intermediate-high- or high-risk acute PE treated with a fixed
      low-dose USAT protocol (r-tPA 10-20 mg/15 h). Of these, 9 patients tested
      positive for COVID-19 and were age-sex-matched to 27 patients without COVID-19.
      The USAT protocol included, beyond the infusion of recombinant tissue plasminogen
      activator, anti-Xa-activity-adjusted unfractionated heparin therapy (target
      0.3-0.7 U/mL). The study outcomes were the invasively measured mean pulmonary
      arterial pressure (mPAP) before and at completion of USAT, and the National Early
      Warning Score (NEWS), according to which more points indicate more severe
      hemodynamic impairment. Twenty-four (66.7%) patients were men; the mean age was
      67 +/- 14 years. Mean &amp;nbsp;+/- &amp;nbsp;standard deviation mPAP decreased
      from 32.3 +/- 8.3 to 22.4 +/- 7.0 mmHg among COVID-19 patients and from 35.4 +/- 
      9.7 to 24.6 +/- 7.0 mmHg among unexposed, with no difference in the relative
      improvement between groups (p = 0.84). Within 12 h of USAT start, the median NEWS
      decreased from six (Q1-Q3: 4-8) to three (Q1-Q3: 2-4) points among COVID-19
      patients and from four (Q1-Q3: 2-6) to two (Q1-Q3: 2-3) points among unexposed (p
      = 0.29). One COVID-19 patient died due to COVID-19-related complications 14 days 
      after acute PE. No major bleeding events occurred. Conclusions. Among patients
      with COVID-19-associated acute PE, mPAP rapidly decreased during USAT with a
      concomitant progressive improvement of the NEWS. The magnitude of mPAP reduction 
      was similar in patients with and without COVID-19.

TI  - Source Identification and Genome-Wide Association Analysis of Crown Rot
      Resistance in Wheat.
LID - 1912 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/plants11151912 [doi]
AB  - Crown rot (CR) is a soil-borne disease of wheat in arid and semiarid areas of the
      world. The incidence rate and severity of CR are increasing with each passing
      year, which seriously threatens the safety of world wheat production. Here, 522
      wheat varieties/lines representing genetic diversity were used to identify and
      evaluate the resistance source to CR disease. Six varieties, including Zimai 12, 
      Xinong 509, Mazhamai, Sifangmai, and Dawson, were classified as resistant (R) to 
      CR. Seventy-nine varieties were classified as moderately resistant (MR) to CR,
      accounting for 15.13% of the tested varieties. The wheat 660 K SNP array was used
      to identify resistance loci by genome-wide association analysis (GWAS). A total
      of 33 SNPs, located on chromosomes 1A, 1B, 1D, 4A, and 4D, were significantly
      correlated with seedling resistance to CR in two years. Among them, one SNP on
      chromosome 1A and nine SNPs on chromosome 1B showed most significant resistance
      to disease, phenotypic variance explained (PVE) by these SNPs were more than
      8.45%. Except that significant locus AX-110436287 and AX109621209 on chromosome
      1B and AX-94692276 on 1D are close to the already reported QTL, other SNPs are
      newly discovered resistance loci. These results could lay a strong theoretical
      foundation for the genetic improvement and breeding for CR resistance in wheat.

TI  - Bacterioplankton Associated with Toxic Cyanobacteria Promote Pisum sativum (Pea) 
      Growth and Nutritional Value through Positive Interactions.
LID - 1511 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms10081511 [doi]
AB  - Research on Plant Growth-Promoting Bacteria (PGPB) has focused much more on
      rhizospheric bacteria. However, PGPB associated with toxic cyanobacterial bloom
      (TCB) could enter the rhizosphere through irrigation water, helping plants such
      as Pisum sativum L. (pea) overcome oxidative stress induced by microcystin (MC)
      and improve plant growth and nutritional value. This study aimed to isolate
      bacteria associated with toxic cyanobacteria, test PGPB properties, and inoculate
      them as a consortium to pea seedlings irrigated with MC to investigate their role
      in plant protection as well as in improving growth and nutritional value. Two
      bacterioplankton isolates and one rhizosphere isolate were isolated and purified 
      on a mineral salt medium supplemented with 1000 mug/L MC and identified via their
      16S rRNA gene. The mixed strains were inoculated to pea seedlings in pots
      irrigated with 0, 50, and 100 mug/L MC. We measured the morphological and
      physiological parameters of pea plants at maturity and evaluated the efficiency
      of the plant's enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant responses to assess the
      role and contribution of PGPB. Both bacterioplankton isolates were identified as 
      Starkeya sp., and the rhizobacterium was identified as
      Brevundimonas&amp;nbsp;aurantiaca. MC addition significantly (p &lt; 0.05)
      reduced all the growth parameters of the pea, i.e., total chlorophyll content,
      leaf quantum yield, stomatal conductance, carotenoids, and polyphenol contents,
      in an MC concentration-dependent manner, while bacterial presence positively
      affected all the measured parameters. In the MC treatment, the levels of the
      pea's antioxidant traits, including SOD, CAT, POD, PPO, GST, and ascorbic acid,
      were increased in the sterile pots. In contrast, these levels were reduced with
      double and triple PGPB addition. Additionally, nutritional values such as sugars,
      proteins, and minerals (Ca and K) in pea fruits were reduced under MC exposure
      but increased with PGPB addition. Overall, in the presence of MC, PGPB seem to
      positively interact with pea plants and thus may constitute a natural alternative
      for soil fertilization when irrigated with cyanotoxin-contaminated water,
      increasing the yield and nutritional value of crops.

TI  - Bacterial Volatiles Known to Inhibit Phytophthora infestans Are Emitted on Potato
      Leaves by Pseudomonas Strains.
LID - 1510 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms10081510 [doi]
AB  - Bacterial volatiles play important roles in mediating beneficial interactions
      between plants and their associated microbiota. Despite their relevance,
      bacterial volatiles are mostly studied under laboratory conditions, although
      these strongly differ from the natural environment bacteria encounter when
      colonizing plant roots or shoots. In this work, we ask the question whether
      plant-associated bacteria also emit bioactive volatiles when growing on plant
      leaves rather than on artificial media. Using four potato-associated Pseudomonas,
      we demonstrate that potato leaves offer sufficient nutrients for the four strains
      to grow and emit volatiles, among which 1-undecene and Sulfur compounds have
      previously demonstrated the ability to inhibit the development of the oomycete
      Phytophthora&amp;nbsp;infestans, the causative agent of potato late blight. Our
      results bring the proof of concept that bacterial volatiles with known plant
      health-promoting properties can be emitted on the surface of leaves and warrant
      further studies to test the bacterial emission of bioactive volatiles in
      greenhouse and field-grown plants.

TI  - LC-MS/MS-Based Fungicide Accumulation Assay to Demonstrate Efflux Activity in the
      Wheat Pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici.

AB  - Increased drug efflux compromises the efficacy of a large panel of treatments in 
      the clinic against cancer or bacterial, fungal, and viral diseases, and in
      agriculture due to the emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogenic fungi. Until
      recently, to demonstrate increased drug efflux, the use of labeled drugs or
      fluorescent dyes was necessary. With the increasing sensitivity of detection
      devices, direct assessment of drug efflux has become realistic. Here, we describe
      a medium-throughput method to assess the intracellular drug concentration in the 
      plant pathogenic fungus Zymoseptoria tritici cultivated in the presence of a
      sublethal fungicide concentration. As a model fungicide, we used the
      succinate-dehydrogenase inhibitor boscalid. The boscalid concentration was
      assessed in the different culture fractions using mass spectrometry linked to
      liquid chromatography (LC-MS/MS). The ratio between the intracellular and total
      boscalid amount was used as an inversed proxy for the efflux activity. Using
      isogenic mutant strains known for their differential efflux capacities, we
      validated the negative correlation between the intracellular boscalid
      concentration and efflux activity. In addition, intra-cellular fungicide
      accumulation explains the susceptibility of the tested strains to boscalid. This 
      assay may be useful in lead development when a new molecule displays good
      inhibitory activity against its isolated target protein but fails to control the 
      target organism.

TI  - Prevalence of pvmrp1 Polymorphisms and Its Contribution to Antimalarial Response.
LID - 1482 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms10081482 [doi]
AB  - As more sporadic cases of chloroquine resistance occur (CQR) in Plasmodium vivax 
      (P. vivax) malaria, molecular markers have become an important tool to monitor
      the introduction and spread of drug resistance. P. vivax multidrug
      resistance-associated protein 1 (PvMRP1), as one of the members of the
      ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, may modulate this phenotype. In this
      study, we investigated the gene mutations and copy number variations (CNVs) in
      the pvmrp1 in 102 P. vivax isolates from China, the Republic of Korea (ROK),
      Myanmar, Papua New Guinea (PNG), Pakistan, the Democratic People's Republic of
      Korea (PRK), and Cambodia. And we also obtained 72 available global pvmrp1
      sequences deposited in the PlasmoDB database to investigate the genetic
      diversity, haplotype diversity, natural selection, and population structure of
      pvmrp1. In total, 29 single nucleotide polymorphisms reflected in 23
      non-synonymous, five synonymous mutations and one gene deletion were identified, 
      and CNVs were found in 2.9% of the isolates. Combined with the antimalarial drug 
      susceptibility observed in the previous in vitro assays, except the prevalence of
      S354N between the two CQ sensitivity categories revealed a significant
      difference, no genetic mutations or CNVs associated with drug sensitivity were
      found. The genetic polymorphism analysis of 166 isolates worldwide found that the
      overall nucleotide diversity (pi) of pvmrp1 was 0.0011, with 46 haplotypes
      identified (Hd = 0.9290). The ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous mutations
      (dn/ds = 0.5536) and the neutrality tests statistic Fu and Li's D* test (Fu and
      Li's D* = -3.9871, p &lt; 0.02) suggests that pvmrp1 had evolved under a
      purifying selection. Due to geographical differences, genetic differentiation
      levels of pvmrp1 in different regions were different to some extent. Overall,
      this study provides a new idea for finding CQR molecular monitoring of P. vivax
      and provides more sequences of pvmrp1 in Asia for subsequent research. However,
      further validation is still needed through laboratory and epidemiological field
      studies of P. vivax samples from more regions.

AB  - Inhomogeneous structures with carbon nanotubes (CNTs), reinforced with Cu
      composite foams as the reinforcing skeletons (CNTs/Cuf((R))Cu), have been
      designed to overcome the paradox between strength and ductility or conductivity
      in copper matrix composites. The interface between CNTs and the copper matrix is 
      usually weak, due to poor wettability and interaction. In this study, nickel
      nanoparticles are decorated onto CNTs to improve interfacial bonding. The broader
      interface transition area between CNTs and copper with Ni3C interfacial products 
      formed, and a combination of improved electrical conductivity (95.6% IACS),
      tensile strength (364.9 MPa), and elongation (40.6%) was achieved for the
      Ni-decorated CNTs/Cuf((R))Cu (Ni-CNTs/Cuf((R))Cu). In addition, the strengthening
      mechanisms are discussed in this study.

TI  - AuAg Nanoparticles Grafted on TiO2@N-Doped Porous Carbon: Improved Depletion of
      Ciprofloxacin under Visible Light through Plasmonic Photocatalysis.
LID - 2524 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nano12152524 [doi]
AB  - TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) were modified to obtain photocatalysts with different
      composition sophistication and displaying improved visible light activity. All of
      them were evaluated in the photodegradation of ciprofloxacin. The band gap of
      TiO2 NPs was successfully tailored by the formation of an N-doped porous carbon
      (NPC)-TiO2 nanohybrid through the pyrolysis of melamine at 600 degrees C, leading
      to a slight red-shift of the absorption band edge for nanohybrid
      NPC-TiO2&amp;nbsp;1. In addition, the in-situ formation and grafting of plasmonic
      AuAg NPs at the surface of NPC sheets and in close contact with TiO2 NPs leads to
      AuAg-NPC-TiO2 nanohybrids 2-3. These nanohybrids showed superior photocatalytic
      performance for the degradation of ciprofloxacin under visible light irradiation,
      compared to pristine P25 TiO2 NPs or to AuAg-PVP-TiO2 nanohybrid 4 in which
      polyvinylpyrrolidone stabilized AuAg NPs were directly grafted to TiO2 NPs. The
      materials were characterized by transmission electron microscope (TEM), High
      Angle Annular Dark Field-Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy-Energy
      Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy HAADF-STEM-EDS, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
      and solid UV-vis spectroscopy. Moreover, the active species involved in the
      photodegradation of ciprofloxacin using AuAg-NCS-TiO2 nanohybrids were evaluated 
      by trapping experiments to propose a mechanism for the degradation.

TI  - Enhanced MEA Performance for an Intermediate-Temperature Fuel Cell with a
      KH5(PO4)2-Doped Polybenzimidazole Membrane.
LID - 728 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/membranes12080728 [doi]
AB  - This work exhibits an effective approach to enhance the performance of
      membrane-electrode assembly (MEA) with KH5(PO4)2-doped PBI membrane, by adding
      phosphoric acid (PA) in the catalyst layer (CL). The ohmic resistance and
      single-cell performance of the MEA, treated with PA, are reduced by ~80% and
      improved by ~800%, respectively, compared to that of untreated MEA. Based on the 
      MEA pretreated with PA, the influence of humidity and temperature on the
      resistance and the single-cell performance are investigated. Under humidified gas
      conditions, the ohmic resistance of MEA is reduced but the charge transfer
      resistance is slightly increased. Regarding the effect of temperature, the ohmic 
      resistance of MEA becomes lower as the temperature elevates from 140 to 180
      degrees C, but increases at 200 degrees C. The maximum peak power density
      presents at 180 degrees C and 20% RH with 454 mW cm(-2). The peak power density
      is favored with temperature increase from 140 to 180 degrees C, but decreases
      with further increase to 200 degrees C. Moreover, when dry gas conditions are
      employed, the output performance is unstable, suggesting that humidification is
      necessary to inhibit degradation for a long-term stability test.

TI  - Effects of Elevated Progesterone Levels on the Day of hCG on the Quality of
      Oocyte and Embryo.
LID - 4319 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jcm11154319 [doi]
AB  - This study is designed to investigate the effects of increased progesterone (P4) 
      levels on the quality of retrieved oocytes and embryos during IVF. This
      retrospective analysis included 982 all-freezing in vitro fertilization (IVF)
      cycles (conducted between November 2019 and June 2020 at CHA Fertility Center
      Bundang, South Korea) in which serum P4 levels were measured on the day of human 
      chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) administration. Our study revealed that the serum P4
      levels on the day of hCG administration are strongly associated with the rates of
      oocyte maturation, displaying a positive correlation in patients with serum P4
      &lt; 2.25 ng/mL (p = 0.025). Moreover, patients with serum P4 &lt; 1.25 ng/mL
      showed relatively low fertilization rates (p = 0.037), and the rates of good
      embryo retrieval were significantly increased with the serum P4 level &lt; 1.5
      ng/mL (p = 0.001). Interestingly, serum P4 level on the day of hCG administration
      affects the rate of good-quality embryo development, especially at the cleavage
      stage, and is associated with the status of ovarian responses. Our current study 
      suggests that serum P4 level on the day of hCG administration negatively affects 
      the rates of oocyte maturation, fertilization, and the development of good
      embryos.

TI  - Ectopic Prostate Tissue in the Uterine Cervix of a Female with Non-Classic
      Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia-A Case Report.
LID - 4307 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jcm11154307 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The occurrence of ectopic prostate tissue in the female genital
      tract is rare and has only been described sporadically. The origin of these
      lesions is unclear, but their appearance seems to be associated with various
      forms of androgen excess, including androgen therapy for transgender treatment or
      disorders of sex development, such as classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia
      (CAH). This is the first described case of ectopic prostate tissue in the cervix 
      uteri of a 46,XX patient with a confirmed diagnosis of non-classic CAH due to
      21-OHD and a history of mild adrenal androgen excess. CASE PRESENTATION: We
      describe a 34-year-old patient with a genetic diagnosis of non-classic CAH due to
      21-hydroxylase deficiency (21-OHD) with a female karyo- and phenotype and a
      history of mild adrenal androgen excess. Due to dysplasia in the cervical smear, 
      conization had to be performed, revealing ectopic prostate tissue in the cervix
      uteri of the patient. CONCLUSIONS: An association between androgen excess and the
      occurrence of prostate tissue is likely and should therefore be considered as a
      differential diagnosis for atypical tissue in the female genital tract.

TI  - Beta-Glucan Alters Gut Microbiota and Plasma Metabolites in Pre-Weaning Dairy
      Calves.
LID - 687 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/metabo12080687 [doi]
AB  - The present study aims to evaluate the alterations in gut microbiome and plasma
      metabolites of dairy calves with beta-glucan (BG) supplementation. Fourteen
      healthy newborn dairy calves with similar body weight were randomly divided into 
      control (n = 7) and BG (n = 7) groups. All the calves were fed on the basal diet,
      while calves in the BG group were supplemented with oat BG on d 8 for 14 days.
      Serum markers, fecal microbiome, and plasma metabolites at d 21 were analyzed.
      The calves were weaned on d 60 and weighed. The mean weaning weight of the BG
      group was 4.29 kg heavier than that of the control group. Compared with the
      control group, the levels of serum globulin, albumin, and superoxide dismutase
      were increased in the BG group. Oat BG intake increased the gut microbiota
      richness and decreased the Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio. Changes in serum
      markers were found to be correlated with the plasma metabolites, including
      sphingosine, trehalose, and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol sulfate, and gut
      microbiota such as Ruminococcaceae_NK4A214, Alistipes, and Bacteroides. Overall, 
      these results suggest that the BG promotes growth and health of pre-weaning dairy
      calves by affecting the interaction between the host and gut microbiota.

TI  - Causal Associations between Paternal Longevity and Risks of Cardiovascular
      Diseases.
LID - 233 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jcdd9080233 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Observational studies have suggested that paternal longevity is
      associated with reduced risks of cardiovascular diseases, yet the causal
      association remains to be determined. OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether
      Mendelian randomization (MR) results support a causal role of paternal longevity 
      for risks of cardiovascular diseases. METHODS: Genetic variants associated with
      paternal longevity and cardiovascular diseases were obtained from public
      genome-wide association study data. We used inverse variance weighted MR under a 
      random-effects model to provide causal estimates between paternal longevity and
      cardiovascular diseases. RESULTS: Paternal longevity was associated with
      decreased risks of coronary heart disease (odds ratio (OR): 0.08; 95% confidence 
      interval (CI): 0.02-0.37; p = 0.001) and peripheral artery disease (OR: 0.15; 95%
      CI: 0.03-0.65; p = 0.011). No significant differences were observed in
      hypertension, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, transient ischemic attack,
      ischemic stroke, or cardiac death. The weighted median method revealed consistent
      results between genetically instrumented paternal longevity and decreased risk of
      coronary heart disease and peripheral artery disease. No significant differences 
      were observed in the MR-Egger results. Multivariable MR consistently indicated
      causal associations between paternal longevity and decreased cardiovascular
      diseases. The leave-one-out analysis suggested that the causal associations were 
      not affected by individual single-nucleotide polymorphisms. The intercept of the 
      MR-Egger estimator and funnel plot revealed no indication of horizontal
      pleiotropic effects. CONCLUSIONS: Our MR analyses supported a causal role of
      paternal longevity for decreased risks of coronary heart disease and peripheral
      artery disease, which highlighted the need for better monitoring and intervention
      of cardiovascular diseases in populations with premature paternal death.

AB  - Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a significant public health concern worldwide and
      many people continue to ignore their early warning symptoms. The present study
      assessed the level of knowledge about CKD the awareness of the risk factors and
      the awareness of the complications associated with CKD, among the general

      participated in an online cross-sectional survey during a seven-month period from
      November (2020) to July (2021). Data was collected using a validated 73-item
      self-report survey. More than half of the respondents were males (n = 286; 65%)
      with an age ranging from 18 to 59 years, and a mean age of 32.66 years (SD +/-
      10.83). A very low percentage of the sample (27.3%; 7.5%, 9.3%) demonstrated good
      knowledge, a high level of awareness of the risk factors, and a high level of
      awareness of the complications associated with CKD, respectively. Participants'
      knowledge was significantly associated with being a student or being employed
      (Government/private employee) (chi(2) = 29.90; p &lt; 0.001), having completed
      graduate studies (chi(2) = 63.86; p &lt; 0.001), residing in urban areas (chi(2) 
      = 138.62; p &lt; 0.001), belonging to the age group (18-39 years), and having no 
      co-morbidities (chi(2) = 24.55; p &lt; 0.001). Positive and significant
      correlations were also noted between the knowledge score and the awareness of
      risk factor score (r = 0.42; p &lt; 0.01), as well as the awareness of
      complications score (r = 0.25; p &lt; 0.01). These findings warrant an urgent
      need for extensive CKD educational initiatives concentrating on improving the
      general knowledge and awareness of the public towards CKD.

TI  - 120 GHz Frequency-Doubler Module Based on GaN Schottky Barrier Diode.

LID - 10.3390/mi13081172 [doi]
AB  - Traditional GaAs-based frequency multipliers still exhibit great challenges to
      meet the demand for solid-state high-power THz sources due to low breakdown
      voltage and heat dissipation of the Schottky barrier diode (SBD). In this study, 
      a GaN SBD chain was fabricated with n(-)/n(+)-GaN structure. As a consequence,
      the breakdown voltage of 54.9 V at 1 muA and cut-off frequency of 587.5 GHz at
      zero bias were obtained. A 120 GHz frequency-doubler module based on the GaN SBD 
      chain was designed and fabricated. When driven with 500 mW input power in a
      continuous wave, the output power of the frequency-doubler module was 15.1 mW at 
      120 GHz. Moreover, the experiments show that the frequency-doubler module can
      endure an input power of 2 W. In addition, it is worth noting that the SBD chain 
      works well at an anode temperature of 337.2 degrees C.

TI  - Figuring Method of High Convergence Ratio for Pulsed Ion Beams Based on
      Frequency-Domain Parameter Control.
LID - 1159 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/mi13081159 [doi]
AB  - The continuous phase plate (CPP) provides excellent beam smoothing and shaping
      impacts in the inertial confinement fusion application. However, due to the
      features of its dispersion, its surface gradient is frequently too large (&gt;2
      mum/cm) to process. When machining a large gradient surface with continuous ion
      beam figuring (IBF), the acceleration of the machine motion axis cannot fulfill
      the appropriate requirements, and the machining efficiency is further influenced 
      by the unavoidable extra removal layer. The pulsed ion beam (PIB) discretizes the
      ion beam by incorporating frequency-domain parameters, resulting in a pulsed beam
      with a controlled pulse width and frequency and avoiding the extra removal layer.
      This research evaluates the processing convergence ability of IBF and PIB for the
      large gradient surface using simulation and experiment. The findings reveal that 
      PIB offers obvious advantages under the same beam diameter. Compared with the
      convergence ratio (gamma = 2.02) and residuals (RMS = 184.36 nm) of IBF, the
      residuals (RMS = 27.48 nm) of PIB are smaller, and the convergence ratio (gamma =
      8.47) is higher. This work demonstrates that PIB has better residual convergence 
      in large gradient surface processing. It is expected to realize ion beam
      machining with a higher convergence ratio.

TI  - Amplicon Sequencing Reveals Novel Fungal Species Responsible for a Controversial 
      Tea Disease.
LID - 782 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jof8080782 [doi]
AB  - Amplicon sequencing is a powerful tool for analyzing the fungal composition
      inside plants, whereas its application for the identification of etiology for
      plant diseases remains undetermined. Here, we utilize this strategy to clarify
      the etiology responsible for tea leaf brown-black spot disease (LBSD), a
      noticeable disease infecting tea plants etiology that remains controversial.
      Based on the ITS-based amplicon sequencing analysis, Didymella species were
      identified as separate from Pestalotiopsis spp. and Cercospora sp., which are
      concluded as the etiological agents. This was further confirmed by the fungal
      isolation and their specific pathogenicity on diverse tea varieties. Based on the
      morphologies and phylogenetic analysis constructed with multi-loci (ITS, LSU,
      tub2, and rpb2), two novel Didymella species-tentatively named D. theae and D.
      theifolia as reference to their host plants-were proposed and characterized.
      Here, we present an integrated approach of ITS-based amplicon sequencing in
      combination with fungal isolation and fulfillment of Koch's postulates for
      etiological identification of tea plant disease, revealing new etiology for LBSD.
      This contributes useful information for further etiological identification of
      plant disease based on amplicon sequencing, as well as understanding, prevention,
      and management of this economically important disease.

TI  - Adenylsuccinate Synthetase MoADE12 Plays Important Roles in the Development and
      Pathogenicity of the Rice Blast Fungus.
LID - 780 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jof8080780 [doi]
AB  - Purines are basic components of nucleotides in living organisms. In this study,
      we identified the ortholog of adenylosuccinate synthase MoADE12 in Magnaporthe
      oryzae by screening for growth-defective T-DNA insertional mutants. Gene
      replacement was performed to investigate the biological role of MoADE12.
      Deltamoade12 mutants were adenine auxotrophs that failed to produce conidia, and 
      showed reduced perithecia formation and pathogenicity. Moreover, the Deltamoade12
      mutant was hypersensitive to Congo red and oxidants, indicating that MoADE12 was 
      required for cell wall integrity and oxidative stress resistance. Transcriptomic 
      analysis identified the underlying mechanisms and indicated that several
      pathogenicity-related genes were regulated in the Deltamoade12 mutant. Therefore,
      our data suggest that the adenylosuccinate synthase MoADE12 is involved in the de
      novo AMP biosynthesis pathway and is important for conidiation and pathogenicity 
      in the rice blast fungus.

TI  - Application of Trichoderma Hz36 and Hk37 as Biocontrol Agents against Clubroot
      Caused by Plasmodiophora brassicae.
LID - 777 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jof8080777 [doi]
AB  - Clubroot, a soil-infective disease caused by Plasmodiophora brassicae, is a
      serious disease affecting cruciferous plants around the world. There is no
      effective control measure to completely remove this pathogen from fields after
      infection. Here, we screened and identified two strains (Hz36, Trichoderma
      guizhouense; Hk37, Trichoderma koningiopsis) of Trichoderma from the gall of
      clubroot in rapeseed fields with biocontrol potential for clubroot. The
      fermentation broth of Hz36 could significantly inhibit the germination of resting
      spores of P. brassicae, and promote the seed germination and root growth of
      rapeseed. The biocontrol efficiency of Hz36 strain on clubroot for rapeseed and
      Arabidopsis&amp;nbsp;thaliana was 44.29% and 52.18%, respectively. The qPCR
      results revealed that strain Hz36 treatment could significantly reduce the
      content of P. brassicae in root cells, and paraffin section analysis revealed
      that it could delay the development of P. brassicae. Strain Hk37 showed similar
      effects to strain Hz36, whose biocontrol efficiency of clubroot could reach
      57.30% in rapeseed and 68.01% in A. thaliana. These results indicate that strains
      Hz36 and Hk37 have the potential for the biocontrol of clubroot.

TI  - Identification and Functional Characterization of Adenosine Deaminase in Mucor
      circinelloides: A Novel Potential Regulator of Nitrogen Utilization and Lipid
      Biosynthesis.
LID - 774 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jof8080774 [doi]
AB  - Adenosine deaminase (ADA) is an enzyme distributed in a wide variety of organisms
      that cleaves adenosine into inosine. Since inosine plays an important role in
      nitrogen metabolism, ADA may have a critical function in the regulation of fatty 
      acid synthesis. However, the role of ADA in oleaginous fungi has not been
      reported so far. Therefore, in this study, we identified one ada gene encoding
      ADA (with ID scaffold0027.9) in the high lipid-producing fungus, Mucor
      circinelloides WJ11, and investigated its role in cell growth, lipid production, 
      and nitrogen metabolism by overexpressing and knockout of this gene. The results 
      showed that knockout of the ada altered the efficiency of nitrogen consumption,
      which led to a 20% increment in the lipid content (25% of cell dry weight) of the
      engineered strain, while overexpression of the ada showed no significant
      differences compared with the control strain at the final growth stage; however, 
      interestingly, it increased lipid accumulation at the early growth stage.
      Additionally, transcriptional analysis was conducted by RT-qPCR and our findings 
      indicated that the deletion of ada activated the committed steps of lipid
      biosynthesis involved in acetyl-CoA carboxylase (acc1 gene), cytosolic malic acid
      enzyme (cme1 gene), and fatty acid synthases (fas1 gene), while it suppressed the
      expression of AMP-activated protein kinase (ampk alpha1 and ampk beta genes),
      which plays a role in lipolysis, whereas the ada-overexpressed strain displayed
      reverse trends. Conclusively, this work unraveled a novel role of ADA in
      governing lipid biosynthesis and nitrogen metabolism in the oleaginous fungus, M.
      circinelloides.

TI  - A Comprehensive Review on Temporal-Action Proposal Generation.
LID - 207 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jimaging8080207 [doi]
AB  - Temporal-action proposal generation (TAPG) is a well-known pre-processing of
      temporal-action localization and mainly affects localization performance on
      untrimmed videos. In recent years, there has been growing interest in proposal
      generation. Researchers have recently focused on anchor- and boundary-based
      methods for generating action proposals. The main purpose of this paper is to
      provide a comprehensive review of temporal-action proposal generation with
      network architectures and empirical results. The pre-processing step for input
      data is also discussed for network construction. The content of this paper was
      obtained from the research literature related to temporal-action proposal
      generation from 2012 to 2022 for performance evaluation and comparison. From
      several well-known databases, we used specific keywords to select 71 related
      studies according to their contributions and evaluation criteria. The
      contributions and methodologies are summarized and analyzed in a tabular form for
      each category. The result from state-of-the-art research was further analyzed to 
      show its limitations and challenges for action proposal generation. TAPG
      performance in average recall ranges from 60% up to 78% in two TAPG benchmarks.
      In addition, several future potential research directions in this field are
      suggested based on the current limitations of the related studies.

TI  - Molecular Insights into the Role of Pathogenic nsSNPs in GRIN2B Gene Provoking
      Neurodevelopmental Disorders.
LID - 1332 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/genes13081332 [doi]
AB  - The GluN2B subunit of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors plays an important role in
      the physiology of different neurodevelopmental diseases. Genetic variations in
      the GluN2B coding gene (GRIN2B) have consistently been linked to West syndrome,
      intellectual impairment with focal epilepsy, developmental delay, macrocephaly,
      corticogenesis, brain plasticity, as well as infantile spasms and Lennox-Gastaut 
      syndrome. It is unknown, however, how GRIN2B genetic variation impacts protein
      function. We determined the cumulative pathogenic impact of GRIN2B variations on 
      healthy participants using a computational approach. We looked at all of the
      known mutations and calculated the impact of single nucleotide polymorphisms on
      GRIN2B, which encodes the GluN2B protein. The pathogenic effect, functional
      impact, conservation analysis, post-translation alterations, their driving
      residues, and dynamic behaviors of deleterious nsSNPs on protein models were then
      examined. Four polymorphisms were identified as phylogenetically conserved PTM
      drivers and were related to structural and functional impact: rs869312669
      (p.Thr685Pro), rs387906636 (p.Arg682Cys), rs672601377 (p.Asn615Ile), and
      rs1131691702 (p.Ser526Pro). The combined impact of protein function is accounted 
      for by the calculated stability, compactness, and total globularity score. GluN2B
      hydrogen occupancy was positively associated with protein stability, and
      solvent-accessible surface area was positively related to globularity.
      Furthermore, there was a link between GluN2B protein folding, movement, and
      function, indicating that both putative high and low local movements were linked 
      to protein function. Multiple GRIN2B genetic variations are linked to gene
      expression, phylogenetic conservation, PTMs, and protein instability behavior in 
      neurodevelopmental diseases. These findings suggest the relevance of GRIN2B
      genetic variations in neurodevelopmental problems.

LID - 10.3390/genes13081321 [doi]
AB  - Quercus acutissima Carruth. is a Chinese important energy plant with high
      ecological and economic values. While the species chloroplast genome has been
      reported, its mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) is still unexplored. Here, we
      assembled and annotated the Q. acutissima mitogenome, and we compared its
      characteristic differences with several closely related species. The Q.
      acutissima mitogenome's main structure is branched with three distinguished
      contigs (linear molecule 1, circular molecule 2, and circular molecule 3) with
      448,982 bp total length and 45.72% GC content. The mitogenome contained 51 genes,
      including 32 protein-coding, 16 tRNA and 3 rRNA genes. We examined codon usage,
      repeated sequences, genome recombination, chloroplast to mitochondrion DNA
      transformation, RNA editing, and synteny in the Q. acutissima mitogenome.
      Phylogenetic trees based on 29 species mitogenomes clarified the species
      classification. Our results provided comprehensive information of Q. acutissima
      mitogenome, and they are expected to provide valuable information for Fagaceae
      evolutionary biology and to promote the species germplasm utilization.

TI  - Transcriptome and Metabonomic Analysis of Tamarix ramosissima Potassium (K+)
      Channels and Transporters in Response to NaCl Stress.
LID - 1313 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/genes13081313 [doi]
AB  - Potassium ion (K(+)) channels and transporters are key components of plant K(+)
      absorption and transportation and play an important role in plant growth and
      development. This study revealed that K(+) channels and transporters are involved
      in the salt tolerance molecular mechanism and metabolites of the halophyte
      representative plant Tamarix&amp;nbsp;ramosissima (T. ramosissima) in response to
      NaCl stress, providing a theoretical basis for the mitigation of salt stress
      using halophytes. Through transcriptome sequencing and metabolite detection
      analysis of 0 h, 48 h and 168 h by applying exogenous K(+) to the roots of T.
      ramosissima under NaCl stress, 15 high-quality Clean Data bases were obtained,
      Q20 reached more than 97%, Q30 reached more than 92%, and GC content reached
      44.5%, which is in line with further bioinformatics analysis. Based on the Liquid
      chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis, the roots of T. ramosissima
      were exposed to exogenous potassium for 48 h and 168 h under NaCl stress, and
      1510 and 1124 metabolites were identified in positive and negative ion mode,
      respectively. Through orthogonal projections to latent structures discriminant
      analysis (OPLS-DA) model analysis, its metabolomic data have excellent
      predictability and stability. The results of this study showed that there were 37
      differentially expressed genes (DEGs) annotated as Class 2 K(+) channels
      (Shaker-like K(+) channel and TPK channel) and Class 3 K(+) transporters
      (HAK/KUP/KT, HKT and CPAs transporter families). Among them, 29 DEGs were
      annotated to the gene ontology (GO) database, and the most genes were involved in
      the GO Biological Process. In addition, the expression levels of Unigene0014342
      in the HAK/KUP/KT transporter and Unigene0088276 and Unigene0103067 in the CPAs
      transporter both first decreased and then increased when treated with 200 mM NaCl
      for 48 h and 168 h. However, when treated with 200 mM NaCl + 10 mM KCl for 48 h
      and 168 h, a continuous upward trend was shown. Notably, the expression level of 
      Unigene0016813 in CPAS transporter continued to increase when treated with 200 mM
      NaCl and 200 mM NaCl + 10 mM KCl for 48 h and 168 h. 3 DEGs, Unigene0088276,
      Unigene0016813 and Unigene0103067, were dominated by the positive regulation of
      their related metabolites, and this correlation was significant. The results
      showed that these DEGs increased the absorption of K(+) and the ratio of
      K(+)/Na(+) under NaCl stress at 48 h and 168 h after adding exogenous potassium
      and enhanced the salt tolerance of T. ramosissima. Notably, the expression level 
      of Unigene0103067 in the CPAs transporter was consistently upregulated when 200
      mM NaCl + 10 mM KCl was treated for 48 h and 168 h. The positive regulatory
      metabolites were always dominant, which better helped T. ramosissima resist salt 
      stress. Unigene0103067 plays an important role in enhancing the salt tolerance of
      T. ramosissima and reducing the toxicity of NaCl in roots. Additionally,
      phylogenetic tree analysis showed that Unigene0103067 and
      Reaumuria&amp;nbsp;trigyna had the closest genetic distance in the evolutionary
      relationship. Finally, 9 DEGs were randomly selected for quantitative real-time
      PCR (qRT-PCR) verification. Their expression trends were completely consistent
      with the transcriptome sequencing analysis results, proving that this study's
      data are accurate and reliable. This study provides resources for revealing the
      molecular mechanism of NaCl stress tolerance in T. ramosissima and lays a
      theoretical foundation for cultivating new salt-tolerant varieties.

TI  - Alternative Splicing Isoforms of Porcine CREB Are Differentially Involved in
      Transcriptional Transactivation.
LID - 1304 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/genes13081304 [doi]
AB  - The cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), a basic leucine zipper
      transcription factor, is involved in the activation of numerous genes in a
      variety of cell types. The CREB gene is rich in alternative splicing (AS) events.
      However, studies on the AS of CREB genes in pigs are limited, and few reports
      have compared the roles of isoforms in activating gene expression. Here, five AS 
      transcripts, V1-5, were characterized by RT-PCR and two, V3 and V5, were new
      identifications. Both V1 and V2 have all the functional domains of the CREB
      protein, with similar tissue expression profiles and mRNA stability, suggesting
      that they have similar roles. The transcriptional transactivation activities of
      four isoforms encoding complete polypeptides were analyzed on the expression of
      the B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2-like protein 2 and the poly (A)-binding protein,
      nuclear 1 genes with a dual-luciferase reporter system, and differential
      activities were observed. Both V1 and V2 have promoting effects, but their roles 
      are gene-specific. V3 has no effect on the promoter of the two genes, while V4
      functions as a repressor. The mechanisms underlying the differential roles of V1 
      and V2 were analyzed with RNA-seq, and the genes specifically regulated by V1 and
      V2 were identified. These results will contribute to further revealing the role
      of CREB and to analyzing the significance of AS in genes.

TI  - Differential Methylation Profile in Fragile X Syndrome-Prone Offspring Mice after
      in Utero Exposure to Lactobacillus Reuteri.
LID - 1300 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/genes13081300 [doi]
AB  - Environmental factors such as diet, gut microbiota, and infections have proven to
      have a significant role in epigenetic modifications. It is known that epigenetic 
      modifications may cause behavioral and neuronal changes observed in
      neurodevelopmental disabilities, including fragile X syndrome (FXS) and autism
      (ASD). Probiotics are live microorganisms that provide health benefits when
      consumed, and in some cases are shown to decrease the chance of developing
      neurological disorders. Here, we examined the epigenetic outcomes in offspring
      mice after feeding of a probiotic organism, Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri),
      to pregnant mother animals. In this study, we tested a cohort of Western diet-fed
      descendant mice exhibiting a high frequency of behavioral features and lower FMRP
      protein expression similar to what is observed in FXS in humans (described in a
      companion manuscript in this same GENES special topic issue). By investigating
      17,735 CpG sites spanning the whole mouse genome, we characterized the epigenetic
      profile in two cohorts of mice descended from mothers treated and non-treated
      with L. reuteri to determine the effect of prenatal probiotic exposure on the
      prevention of FXS-like symptoms. We found several genes involved in different
      neurological pathways being differentially methylated (p </= 0.05) between the
      cohorts. Among the key functions, synaptogenesis, neurogenesis, synaptic
      modulation, synaptic transmission, reelin signaling pathway, promotion of
      specification and maturation of neurons, and long-term potentiation were
      observed. The results of this study are relevant as they could lead to a better
      understanding of the pathways involved in these disorders, to novel therapeutics 
      approaches, and to the identification of potential biomarkers for early detection
      of these conditions.

TI  - Ethylene Plays a Dual Role during Infection by Plasmodiophora brassicae of
      Arabidopsis thaliana.
LID - 1299 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/genes13081299 [doi]
AB  - Plasmodiophora brassicae infection leads to hypertrophy of host roots and
      subsequent formation of galls, causing huge economic losses to agricultural
      producers of Cruciferae plants. Ethylene (ET) has been reported to play a vital
      role against necrotrophic pathogens in the classic immunity system. More clues
      suggested that the defense to pathogens in roots may be different from the
      acrial. The ET pathway may play a positive role in the infection of P. brassicae,
      as shown by recent transcriptome profiling. However, the molecular basis of ET
      remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the potential role of
      ethylene against P. brassicae infection in an ein3/eil1 double-mutant of
      Arabidopsis thaliana (A. thaliana). After infection, ein3/eil1 (Disease Index/DI:
      93) showed more susceptibility compared with wild type (DI: 75). Then, we
      inoculated A. thaliana Columbia-0 (Col-0) with P. brassicae by
      1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) and pyrazinamide (PZA), respectively.
      It was found that the symptoms of infected roots with ACC were more serious than 
      those with PZA at 20 dpi (day post infection). However, the DI were almost the
      same in different treatments at 30 dpi. WRKY75 can be directly regulated by ET
      and was upregulated at 7 dpi with ACC, as shown by qRT-PCR. The wrky75-c mutant
      of A. thaliana (DI: 93.75) was more susceptible than the wild type in
      Arabidopsis. Thus, our work reveals the dual roles of ET in infection of P.
      brassicae and provides evidence of ET in root defense against pathogens.

TI  - Genome-Wide Association Study Identified a Quantitative Trait Locus and Two
      Candidate Genes on Sus scrofa Chromosome 2 Affecting Vulvar Traits of Suhuai
      Pigs.
LID - 1294 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/genes13081294 [doi]
AB  - Vulvar size and angle are meaningful traits in pig production. Sows with abnormal
      vulva generally show reproductive disorders. In order to excavate candidate loci 
      and genes associated with pig's vulvar traits, 270 Suhuai pigs with vulvar
      phenotype were genotyped by a porcine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) Chip.
      Then, Chip data were imputed using resequenced data of 30 Suhuai pigs as a
      reference panel. Next, we estimated the heritability and performed a genome-wide 
      association study (GWAS) for vulvar traits. The heritabilities for the traits
      vulvar length (VL), vulvar width (VW) and vulvar angle (VA) in this pig
      population were 0.23, 0.32 and 0.22, respectively. GWAS based on Chip data
      identified nine significant SNPs on the Sus scrofa chromosomes (SSC) 2, 7, 9 and 
      13 for VL or VW. GWAS based on imputed data identified 11 new quantitative trait 
      loci (QTL) on SSC1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 16 and 17 for VL or VW. The most
      significant QTL for VL on SSC2 were refined to a 3.48-3.97 Mb region using
      linkage disequilibrium and linkage analysis (LDLA). In this refined region, FGF19
      and CCND1, involved in the development of the reproductive tract, cell growth and
      vulvar cancer, could be new candidate genes affecting VL. Our results provided
      potential genetic markers for the breeding of vulvar traits in pigs and deepened 
      the understanding of the genetic mechanism of vulvar traits.

TI  - Taxonomy, Habitat Preference, and Niche Overlap of Two Arrow-Poison Flea Beetle
      Species of the Genus Polyclada in Sub-Saharan Africa (Coleoptera, Chrysomelidae).

AB  - Coupling the geographic distribution and the ecological requirements of species
      often supports taxonomy and biogeography. In this contribution, we update the
      distribution of two flea beetle species of ethno-entomological interest,
      Polyclada bohemani and P. pectinicornis, by analyzing original data. In addition,
      we supply their main morphological diagnostic characters, describing their
      aedeagal and spermathecal shapes for the first time. We also assess their niche
      differences in terms of climatic and vegetation needs, by means of ecological
      niche modelling and remote sensing techniques. Several new localities were
      identified to improve knowledge of the geographical distribution of both species.
      Moreover, we located a wide climatic suitability overlap in East Africa for these
      two flea beetle species, while in other areas they show a clear separation. Our
      analysis also reports that P. bohemani is associated with areas of denser tree
      cover than P. pectinicornis. Finally, the lectotypes of Diamphidia bohemani Baly,
      1861, Clytra pectinicornis Olivier, 1791, and Diamphidia compacta Fairmaire, 1887
      are here designated and the new synonymy Clytra pectinicornis Olivier =
      Diamphidia compacta Fairmaire syn.nov. is proposed.

TI  - Adipokines in Sleep Disturbance and Metabolic Dysfunction: Insights from Network 
      Analysis.
PG  - 321-331
LID - 10.3390/clockssleep4030027 [doi]
AB  - Adipokines are a growing group of secreted proteins that play important roles in 
      obesity, sleep disturbance, and metabolic derangements. Due to the complex
      interplay between adipokines, sleep, and metabolic regulation, an integrated
      approach is required to better understand the significance of adipokines in these
      processes. In the present study, we created and analyzed a network of six
      adipokines and their molecular partners involved in sleep disturbance and
      metabolic dysregulation. This network represents information flow from regulatory
      factors, adipokines, and physiologic pathways to disease processes in metabolic
      dysfunction. Analyses using network metrics revealed that obesity and obstructive
      sleep apnea were major drivers for the sleep associated metabolic dysregulation. 
      Two adipokines, leptin and adiponectin, were found to have higher degrees than
      other adipokines, indicating their central roles in the network. These adipokines
      signal through major metabolic pathways such as insulin signaling, inflammation, 
      food intake, and energy expenditure, and exert their functions in cardiovascular,
      reproductive, and autoimmune diseases. Leptin, AMP activated protein kinase
      (AMPK), and fatty acid oxidation were found to have global influence in the
      network and represent potentially important interventional targets for metabolic 
      and sleep disorders. These findings underscore the great potential of using
      network based approaches to identify new insights and pharmaceutical targets in
      metabolic and sleep disorders.

TI  - Polyphenol Mechanisms against Gastric Cancer and Their Interactions with Gut
      Microbiota: A Review.
PG  - 5247-5261
LID - 10.3390/curroncol29080417 [doi]
AB  - The lack of new drugs and resistance to existing drugs are serious problems in
      gastric cancer(GC) treatment. The research found polyphenols possess
      anti-Helicobacter pylori(Hp) and antitumor activities and may be used in the
      research and development of drugs for cancer prevention and treatment. However,
      polyphenols are affected by their chemical structures and physical properties,
      which leads to relatively low bioavailability and bioactivity in vivo. The
      intestinal flora can improve the absorption, utilization, and biological activity
      of polyphenols, whereas polyphenol compounds can increase the richness of the
      intestinal flora, reduce the activity of carcinogenic bacteria, stabilize the
      proportion of core flora, and maintain homeostasis of the intestinal
      microenvironment. Our review summarizes the gastrointestinal flora-mediated
      mechanisms of polyphenol against GC.

TI  - QTLs Controlling Physiological and Morphological Traits of Barley
      (Hordeum&amp;nbsp;vulgare L.) Seedlings under Salinity, Drought, and Normal
      Conditions.
LID - 26 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/biotech11030026 [doi]
AB  - To identify the genomic regions for the physiological and morphological traits of
      barley genotypes under normal salinity and drought, a set of 103 recombinant
      inbred line (RIL) populations, developed between Badia and Kavir crosses, was
      evaluated under phytotron conditions in a completely randomized design in 2019.
      Linkage maps were prepared using 152 SSR markers, 72 ISSR, 7 IRAP, 29 CAAT, 27
      SCoT, and 15 iPBS alleles. The markers were assigned to seven barley chromosomes 
      and covered 999.29 centimorgans (cM) of the barley genome. In addition, composite
      interval mapping showed 8, 9, and 26 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) under normal,
      drought, and salinity stress conditions, respectively. Our results indicate the
      importance of chromosomes 1, 4, 5, and 7 in salinity stress. These regions were
      involved in genes controlling stomata length (LR), leaf number (LN), leaf weight 
      (LW), and genetic score (SCR). Three major stable pleiotropic QTLs (i.e., qSCS-1,
      qRLS-1, and qLNN-1) were associated with SCR, root length (RL), and root number
      (RN) in both treatments (i.e., normal and salinity), and two major stable
      pleiotropic QTLs (i.e., qSNN-3 and qLWS-3) associated with the stomata number
      (SN) and LW appeared to be promising for marker-assisted selection (MAS). Two
      major-effect QTLs (i.e., SCot8-B-CAAT5-D and HVM54-Bmag0571) on chromosomes 1 and
      2 were characterized for their positive allele effect, which can be used to
      develop barley varieties concerning drought conditions. The new alleles (i.e.,
      qLWS-4a, qSLS-4, qLNS-7b, qSCS-7, and qLNS-7a) identified in this study are
      useful in pyramiding elite alleles for molecular breeding and marker assisted
      selection for improving salinity tolerance in barley.

      Cancer.
LID - 3627 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/cancers14153627 [doi]
AB  - Proton beam therapy (PBT) and photon radiotherapy for stage I non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC) were compared in terms of clinical outcomes and dosimetry. Data
      were obtained from patients who underwent PBT or photon radiotherapy at two
      institutions-the only two facilities where PBT is available in the Republic of
      Korea. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models and propensity score-matched 
      analyses were used to compare local progression-free survival (PFS) and overall
      survival (OS). Survival and radiation exposure to the lungs were compared in the 
      matched population. Of 289 patients included in the analyses, 112 and 177
      underwent PBT and photon radiotherapy, respectively. With a median follow-up
      duration of 27 months, the 2-year local PFS and OS rates were 94.0% and 83.0%,
      respectively. In the multivariate analysis, a biologically effective dose (BED10,
      using alpha/beta = 10 Gy) of >/=125 cobalt gray equivalents was significantly
      associated with improved local PFS and OS. In the matched analyses, the local PFS
      and OS did not differ between groups. However, PBT showed significantly lower
      lung and heart radiation exposure in the mean dose, V5, and V10 than photon
      radiotherapy. PBT significantly reduced radiation exposure to the heart and lungs
      without worsening disease control in stage I NSCLC patients.

TI  - Quality Evaluation of the Oil of Camellia spp.
LID - 2221 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/foods11152221 [doi]
AB  - The oil of Camellia spp. has become a well-known high-quality edible oil because 
      of its rich nutrition. It is of great significance to breed fine varieties of
      Camellia spp. for the sustainable growth of the Camellia spp. industry. This
      study mainly evaluated the quality and antioxidant capacity of the camellia seed 
      from several sources. The fatty acid composition and main active components of 40
      kinds of C. oleifera, C. vietnamensis, C. osmantha, and C. gigantocarpa seeds,
      and so on, from different regions, were tested using GC-MS and HPLC. The quality 
      of different Camellia spp. germplasm resources was comprehensively evaluated
      using multiple indices. The unsaturated fatty acid content and the antioxidant
      capacity of C. vietnamensis from Hainan were higher than those of C. oleifera
      Abel. In addition, there were a few differences in the fatty acid compositions of
      Camellia spp. oil from different species. Correlation analysis confirmed that
      rutin, total saponin, total flavonoids, squalene, and vitamin E were strongly
      correlated to the antioxidant capacity of Camellia spp. In the comprehensive
      evaluation, the best quality and strongest antioxidant activity were found for
      Chengmai Dafeng (C. vietnamensis). These methods in the study were applied for
      the first time for the quality evaluation of the Camellia spp. species. This
      study provided new insights into the quality evaluation of the Camellia spp.
      species, thus facilitating further development of variety breeding along with
      quality evaluation.

TI  - Effect of Coffee on Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Immortalized Human Oral
      Keratinocytes.
LID - 2199 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/foods11152199 [doi]
AB  - Periodontitis is a common inflammatory disease that is strongly influenced by
      dietary habits. Coffee is one of the most common dietary components; however,
      current research on the relationship between coffee consumption and
      periodontitis, as well as its underlying mechanisms, is limited. Based on a
      previous report, caffeine (CA) and chlorogenic acid (CGA) were formulated into
      artificial coffee (AC) for this experiment. Cell viability, prostaglandin E2
      release, Western blotting, cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and
      NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) translocation analyses were performed to explore
      the effects of AC on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced immortalized human oral
      keratinocytes (IHOKs) and elucidate their underlying mechanisms. AC pretreatment 
      attenuated LPS-induced inflammatory mediator release, ROS production, and nuclear
      factor kappa B translocation in IHOKs. CA and CGA promoted AMP-activated protein 
      kinase phosphorylation and down-regulated the nuclear factor-kappaB pathways to
      exert anti-inflammatory effects. Additionally, CGA promoted Nrf2 translocation
      and heme oxygenase-1 expression and showed anti-oxidative effects. Furthermore,
      AC, CA, and CGA components showed synergistic effects. Thus, we predict that
      coffee consumption may be beneficial for alleviating periodontitis. Moreover, the
      main coffee components CA and CGA seem to play a synergistic role in
      periodontitis.

TI  - Convolutional Neural Network for Object Detection in Garlic Root Cutting
      Equipment.
LID - 2197 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/foods11152197 [doi]
AB  - Traditional manual garlic root cutting is inefficient and can cause food safety
      problems. To develop food processing equipment, a novel and accurate object
      detection method for garlic using deep learning-a convolutional neural network-is
      proposed in this study. The you-only-look-once (YOLO) algorithm, which is based
      on lightweight and transfer learning, is the most advanced computer vision method
      for single large object detection. To detect the bulb, the YOLOv2 model was
      modified using an inverted residual module and residual structure. The modified
      model was trained based on images of bulbs with varied brightness, surface
      attachment, and shape, which enabled sufficient learning of the detector. The
      optimum minibatches and epochs were obtained by comparing the test results of
      different training parameters. Research shows that IRM-YOLOv2 is superior to the 
      SqueezeNet, ShuffleNet, and YOLOv2 models of classical neural networks, as well
      as the YOLOv3 and YOLOv4 algorithm models. The confidence score, average
      accuracy, deviation, standard deviation, detection time, and storage space of
      IRM-YOLOv2 were 0.98228, 99.2%, 2.819 pixels, 4.153, 0.0356 s, and 24.2 MB,
      respectively. In addition, this study provides an important reference for the
      application of the YOLO algorithm in food research.

TI  - Lower Limb Biomechanics during the Topspin Forehand in Table Tennis: A Systemic
      Review.
LID - 336 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/bioengineering9080336 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study is to review the valuable lower limb biomechanical
      contribution to table tennis topspin forehand. Databases included Scopus, PubMed,
      and Web of science. In this case, 19 articles were selected for the systematic
      review. The mechanics of the plantar, lower limb joints kinematics and kinetics, 
      muscle activity, and racket-joint relationship are described through gender,
      performance level, and footwork. The study found that the hip movement
      characteristics and the hip muscle group activity following a proximal-to-distal 
      sequence strategy significantly contributed to the maximum acceleration of the
      racket. Optimizing the motion strategy of the ankle and plantar as well as the
      ankle muscle group activity is beneficial for the transmission of energy in the
      kinetic chain. Muscle groups around the ankle and subtalar joints are heavily
      activated during landing to maintain foot stability during the landing phase.
      Lower limb muscle development plays an important role in movement control and
      stability as well as sports injury prevention in table tennis footwork during the
      performance of the topspin forehand. Furthermore, physical development levels and
      anatomical differences (such as hip and lower trunk muscle strength differences),
      maybe the main reasons for gender differences observed during the topspin
      forehand. Systematically summarizing this valuable information can contribute to 
      athletes' and coaches' knowledge to enhance topspin forehand performance and
      training regimes. We suggest that future research could consider the joint
      contact forces, ball movement, and ball-racket impact during a performance of
      topspin forehand.

TI  - Effects of Resveratrol Administration in Liver Injury Prevention as Induced by an
      Obesogenic Diet: Role of Ruminococcaceae.
LID - 1797 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines10081797 [doi]
AB  - Gut microbiota dysbiosis has been described in several metabolic disruptions,
      such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Administration of resveratrol 
      has been claimed to elicit benefits against NAFLD along with modulating gut
      microbiota composition. This investigation aims to study the putative mediating
      role of gut microbiota in the potential hepato-protective effects of resveratrol 
      in a diet-induced NAFLD rat model. The involvement of bacteria from the
      Ruminococcaceae family in such effects was also addressed. Resveratrol
      administration resulted in lowered liver weight and serum total and non-HDL
      cholesterol concentrations, as well as in increased serum HDL cholesterol levels.
      The administration of this polyphenol also prevented obesogenic diet-induced
      serum transaminase increases. In addition, histopathological analysis revealed
      that resveratrol administration ameliorated the dietary-induced liver steatosis
      and hepatic inflammation. Gut microbiota sequencing showed an inverse
      relationship between some bacteria from the Ruminococcaceae family and the
      screened hepatic markers, whereas in other cases the opposite relationship was
      also found. Interestingly, an interaction was found between UBA-1819 abundance
      and resveratrol induced liver weight decrease, suggesting that for this marker
      resveratrol induced effects were greater when the abundance of this bacteria was 
      high, while no actions were found when UBA-1819 abundance was low.

TI  - Long-Term Persistence of Mitochondrial DNA Instability in HIV-Exposed Uninfected 
      Children during and after Exposure to Antiretroviral Drugs and HIV.
LID - 1786 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines10081786 [doi]
AB  - HIV-exposed uninfected (HEU) children show impaired health outcomes during
      childhood. A high rate of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) instability was reported in
      the blood of HEU at birth. We aimed to explore the relationship between these
      health outcomes and mtDNA deletions over time in a case series of 24 HEU
      children. MtDNA instability was assessed by deep sequencing and analyzed by
      eKLIPse-v2 algorithm at three time points, namely birth, 1 year, and 6 years of
      age. Association between mtDNA deletion and health outcomes, including growth,
      clinical, and neurodevelopmental parameters, were explored using univariate
      statistical analyses and after stratification with relevant variables. HEU
      children were selected with an equal male:female ratio. An elevated number of
      mtDNA deletions and duplications events was observed at 7 days' post-partum.
      Median heteroplasmy increased at one year of life and then returned to baseline
      by six years of age. The mtDNA instability was acquired and was not transmitted
      by the mother. No risk factors were significantly associated with mtDNA
      instability. In this small case series, we did not detect any association between
      any health outcome at 6 years and mtDNA instability measures. A significant
      effect modification of the association between the duration of maternal
      prophylaxis and child growth was observed after stratification with heteroplasmy 
      rate. Genomic instability persists over time among HEU children but, despite its 
      extension, stays subclinical at six years.

LID - 10.3390/biomedicines10081781 [doi]
AB  - Angiogenesis is the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing vessels.
      Adequate oxygen transport and waste removal are necessary for tissue homeostasis.
      Restrictions in blood supply can lead to ischaemia which can contribute to
      disease pathology. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is essential in
      angiogenesis and myogenesis, making it an ideal candidate for angiogenic and
      myogenic stimulation in muscle. We established C2C12 mouse myoblast cell lines
      which stably express elevated levels of (i) human VEGF-A and (ii) dual human
      FGF4-VEGF-A. Both stably transfected cells secreted increased amounts of human
      VEGF-A compared to non-transfected cells, with the latter greater than the
      former. In vitro, conditioned media from engineered cells resulted in a
      significant increase in endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tube
      formation. In vivo, this conditioned media produced a 1.5-fold increase in
      angiogenesis in the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay. Delivery of the
      engineered myoblasts on Matrigel demonstrated continued biological activity by
      eliciting an almost 2-fold increase in angiogenic response when applied directly 
      to the CAM assay. These studies qualify the use of genetically modified myoblasts
      in therapeutic angiogenesis for the treatment of muscle diseases associated with 
      vascular defects.

TI  - Potential Applications of Lilium Plants in Cosmetics: A Comprehensive Review
      Based on Research Papers and Patents.
LID - 1458 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/antiox11081458 [doi]
AB  - The application of cosmetics is indispensable in our current society. In recent
      years, with an increasing awareness of the long-term health benefits of naturally
      sourced ingredients, plant-based cosmetic products have gained increasing
      attention. Lilium belongs to the Liliaceae family, which is one of the main plant
      families used in cosmetics for skin care treatment. A large number of studies
      have shown that Lilium plants are rich in components such as phenolic acids,
      flavonoids, and polysaccharides, with high potential for cosmetic applications.
      However, the application of lilies in cosmetics has not been systematically
      reported. This knowledge gap can easily lead to the neglect of its application in
      cosmetics because lilies are most familiar as ornamental plants. Integrating
      academic papers and patent publications, we analyzed the potential cosmetic
      application ingredients in lily, as well as their applications in cosmetics and
      related efficacy. Patent analysis showed that applications for lily-related
      cosmetic patents are mainly concentrated in East Asia, including China, Korea,
      and Japan. The application of lilies involves all aspects of cosmetics, such as
      sunscreens, facial cleansers, facial masks, conditioners, and so on. Its
      functions are also rich and diverse, including antiaging, radiation protective,
      whitening, moisturizing, freckle removal, acne treatment, and hair regeneration
      promotion. In addition, lilies are compatible with the application of other
      herbs. Moreover, with a change in people's consumption concepts and the
      consideration of long-term health benefits, lily-based food and medicine
      innovation with health care and beautification effects may be a promising
      direction.

TI  - 5G Electromagnetic Radiation Attenuates Skin Melanogenesis In Vitro by
      Suppressing ROS Generation.
LID - 1449 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/antiox11081449 [doi]
AB  - Recently, the impacts of 5G electromagnetic radiation (EMR) with 28 GHz on human 
      health have been attracting public attention with the advent of 5G wireless
      communication. Here, we report that 5G (28 GHz) EMR can attenuate the skin
      pigmentation in murine melanoma cells (B16F10) and a 3D pigmented human epidermis
      model (Melanoderm). B16 cells were exposed to 5G (28 GHz) with or without
      alpha-MSH for 4 h per day. Interestingly, 5G attenuated alpha-MSH-induced melanin
      synthesis. Fontana-Masson staining confirmed that the dendritic formation of
      alpha-MSH stimulated B16 cells was diminished by 5G exposure. To confirm the
      anti-melanogenic effect of 5G EMR, MelanoDerm was irradiated with 5G at a power
      intensity of 10 W/m(2) for 4 h a day for 16 days and melanin distribution was
      detected with Fontana-Masson staining, which supported the anti-melanogenic
      effect of 5G EMR. Consistently, 5G EMR suppressed alpha-MSH induced upregulation 
      of melanogenic enzymes; tyrosinase, TRP-1, and TRP-2. Of note, 5G EMR attenuated 
      ROS production stimulated by alpha-MSH and H2O2, suggesting that 5G EMR may
      dissipate ROS generation, which is pivotal for the melanin synthesis.
      Collectively, we demonstrated that 5G EMR can attenuate skin pigmentation by
      attenuating ROS generation.

TI  - Metabolic Analyses and Evaluation of Antioxidant Activity in Purple Kohlrabi
      Sprouts after Exposed to UVB Radiation.
LID - 1443 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/antiox11081443 [doi]
AB  - Various metabolites act as plant defense molecules due to their antioxidant
      abilities. This study aimed to investigate the influence of UVB irradiation on
      the accumulation of metabolites, including primary metabolites (sugar, sugar
      alcohols, amino acids, organic acids, and an amine) and secondary metabolites
      (anthocyanins, fatty acids, and phenolic acids), and its synergistic antioxidant 
      ability, in purple kohlrabi sprouts. Metabolite analyses revealed a total of 92
      metabolites in the sprouts. Specifically, the levels of most amino acids
      increased after 24 h of UVB treatment, and then slightly decreased in the
      kohlrabi sprouts. The levels of most sugars and sugar alcohols increased after 24
      h of UVB treatment and then decreased. The levels of TCA cycle intermediates and 
      phenolic acids gradually increased during the UVB treatment. Furthermore, the
      levels of some fatty acids gradually increased during the UVB treatment, and the 
      levels of the other fatty acids increased after 6 h of UVB treatment and then
      decreased. In particular, the levels of most anthocyanins, known to be strong
      antioxidants, gradually increased after 24 h of UVB treatment. In the in vitro
      ABTS scavenging assay, UVB-treated purple kohlrabi sprouts showed increased
      scavenging ability. This may be attributed to the increased accumulation of
      metabolites acting as antioxidants, in response to UVB treatment. This study
      confirmed that UVB irradiation induced the alteration of primary and secondary
      metabolism in the kohlrabi sprouts.

TI  - Mitigation of Memory Impairment with Fermented Fucoidan and lambda-Carrageenan
      Supplementation through Modulating the Gut Microbiota and Their Metagenome
      Function in Hippocampal Amyloid-beta Infused Rats.
LID - 2301 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/cells11152301 [doi]
AB  - Attenuating acetylcholinesterase and insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1
      signaling in the hippocampus is associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD)
      development. Fucoidan and carrageenan are brown and red algae, respectively, with
      potent antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antiviral activities.
      This study examined how low-molecular-weight (MW) and high-MW fucoidan and
      lambda-carrageenan would improve memory impairment in Alzheimer's disease-induced
      rats caused by an infusion of toxic amyloid-beta(Abeta). Fucoidan and
      lambda-carrageenan were dissected into low-MW by Luteolibacter&amp;nbsp;algae and
      Pseudoalteromonas&amp;nbsp;carrageenovora. Rats receiving an Abeta(25-35)
      infusion in the CA1 region of the hippocampus were fed dextrin (AD-Con), 1%
      high-MW fucoidan (AD-F-H), 1% low-MW fucoidan (AD-F-L), 1% high-MW
      lambda-carrageenan (AD-C-H), and 1% low-MW lambda-carrageenan (AD-C-L) for six
      weeks. Rats to receive saline infusion (Normal-Con) had an AD-Con diet. The
      AD-F-L group showed an improved memory function, which manifested as an enhanced 
      Y-maze spontaneous alternation test, water maze, and passive avoidance tests,
      similar to the Normal-Con group. AD-F-L also potentiated hippocampal insulin
      signaling and increased the expression of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and 
      brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus. AD-C-L improved the 
      memory function mainly by increasing the BDNF content. AD-F-H and AD-C-H did not 
      improve the memory function. Compared to AD-Con, the ascending order of AD-C-H,
      AD-F-H, AD-C-L, and AD-F-L increased insulin signaling by enhancing the
      pSTAT3(R)pAkt(R)pGSK-3beta pathway. AD-F-L improved glucose tolerance the most.
      Compared to AD-CON, the AD-F-L treatment increased the serum acetate
      concentrations and compensated for the defect of cerebral glucose metabolism.
      AD-Con increased Clostridium, Terrisporobacter and Sporofaciens compared to
      Normal-Con, and AD-F-L and AD-C-L increased Akkermentia. In conclusion, AD-F-L
      and AD-C-L alleviated the memory function in the rats with induced AD symptoms by
      modulating.

TI  - Neuroprotective and Anti-Inflammatory Effects of Linoleic Acid in Models of
      Parkinson's Disease: The Implication of Lipid Droplets and Lipophagy.
LID - 2297 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/cells11152297 [doi]
AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease
      after Alzheimer's disease. The principal pathological feature of PD is the
      progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the ventral midbrain. This pathology 
      involves several cellular alterations: oxidative stress, mitochondrial
      dysfunction, loss of proteostasis, and autophagy impairment. Moreover, in recent 
      years, lipid metabolism alterations have become relevant in PD pathogeny. The
      modification of lipid metabolism has become a possible way to treat the disease. 
      Because of this, we analyzed the effect and possible mechanism of action of
      linoleic acid (LA) on an SH-SY5Y PD cell line model and a PD mouse model, both
      induced by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) treatment. The results show that LA acts as
      a potent neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory agent in these PD models. We also 
      observed that LA stimulates the biogenesis of lipid droplets and improves the
      autophagy/lipophagy flux, which resulted in an antioxidant effect in the in vitro
      PD model. In summary, we confirmed the neuroprotective effect of LA in vitro and 
      in vivo against PD. We also obtained some clues about the novel neuroprotective
      mechanism of LA against PD through the regulation of lipid droplet dynamics.

TI  - AKT1 Transcriptomic Landscape in Breast Cancer Cells.
LID - 2290 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/cells11152290 [doi]
AB  - Overexpression and hyperactivation of the serine/threonine protein kinase B (AKT)
      pathway is one of the most common cellular events in breast cancer progression.
      However, the nature of AKT1-specific genome-wide transcriptomic alterations in
      breast cancer cells and breast cancer remains unknown to this point. Here, we
      delineate the impact of selective AKT1 knock down using gene-specific siRNAs or
      inhibiting the AKT activity with a pan-AKT inhibitor VIII on the nature of
      transcriptomic changes in breast cancer cells using the genome-wide
      RNA-sequencing analysis. We found that changes in the cellular levels of AKT1
      lead to changes in the levels of a set of differentially expressed genes and, in 
      turn, imply resulting AKT1 cellular functions. In addition to an expected
      positive relationship between the status of AKT1 and co-expressed cellular genes,
      our study unexpectedly discovered an inherent role of AKT1 in inhibiting the
      expression of a subset of genes in both unstimulated and growth factor stimulated
      breast cancer cells. We found that depletion of AKT1 leads to upregulation of a
      subset of genes-many of which are also found to be downregulated in breast tumors
      with elevated high AKT1 as well as upregulated in breast tumors with no
      detectable AKT expression. Representative experimental validation studies in two 
      breast cancer cell lines showed a reasonable concurrence between the expression
      data from the RNA-sequencing and qRT-PCR or data from ex vivo inhibition of AKT1 
      activity in cancer patient-derived cells. In brief, findings presented here
      provide a resource for further understanding of AKT1-dependent modulation of gene
      expression in breast cancer cells and broaden the scope and significance of AKT1 
      targets and their functions.

TI  - Magnesium Supplementation Attenuates Ultraviolet-B-Induced Damage Mediated
      through Elevation of Polyamine Production in Human HaCaT Keratinocytes.
LID - 2268 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/cells11152268 [doi]
AB  - Magnesium ions (Mg(2+)) have favorable effects such as the improvement of barrier
      function and the reduction of inflammation reaction in inflammatory skin
      diseases. However, its mechanisms have not been fully understood. Microarray
      analysis has shown that the gene expressions of polyamine synthases are
      upregulated by MgCl2 supplementation in human HaCaT keratinocytes. Here, we
      investigated the mechanism and function of polyamine production. The mRNA and
      protein levels of polyamine synthases were dose-dependently increased by MgCl2
      supplementation, which were inhibited by U0126, a MEK inhibitor; CHIR-99021, a
      glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) inhibitor; and Naphthol AS-E, a cyclic
      AMP-response-element-binding protein (CREB) inhibitor. Similarly, reporter
      activities of polyamine synthases were suppressed by these inhibitors, suggesting
      that MEK, GSK3, and CREB are involved in the transcriptional regulation of
      polyamine synthases. Cell viability was reduced by ultraviolet B (UVB) exposure, 
      which was rescued by MgCl2 supplementation. The UVB-induced elevation of reactive
      oxygen species was attenuated by MgCl2 supplementation, which was inhibited by
      cysteamine, a polyamine synthase inhibitor. Our data indicate that the expression
      levels of polyamine synthases are upregulated by MgCl2 supplementation mediated
      through the activation of the MEK/GSK3/CREB pathway. MgCl2 supplementation may be
      useful in reducing the UVB-induced oxidative stress in the skin.

TI  - Differential Expression of miRNAs and Their Predicted Target Pathways in Cochlear
      Nucleus Following Chronic Noise Exposure in Rats.
LID - 2266 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/cells11152266 [doi]
AB  - Several recent preclinical studies have reported that dynamic changes in miRNA
      expression contribute to hearing function. This study aims to investigate miRNA
      expression changes in the cochlear nuclei (CN) of rats following chronic noise
      exposure. Eight-week-old rats (n = 14) were exposed to noise for 4 weeks. The
      control rats (n = 14) were raised under identical conditions without noise. Two
      months after noise exposure, the auditory brainstem response (ABR) was examined, 
      and the cochlea and CN were harvested. In the CN, the expression levels of arc,
      neurocan, and brevican were measured (n = 6 per group). Furthermore, the
      expression levels of miRNAs and their predicted target genes were measured in the
      CN (n = 8 per group). ABR thresholds were elevated after 4 weeks of noise
      exposure, which were maintained for 3 months. In CN, the protein expression of
      arc and brevican was higher in the noise-exposed group than in the control group 
      (0.95 [standard deviation (SD) = 0.53] vs. 3.19 [SD = 1.00], p &lt; 0.001 for arc
      and 1.02 [SD = 0.10] vs. 1.66 [SD = 0.24], p &lt; 0.001 for brevican). The
      noise-exposed rats exhibited lower expression levels of miR-758-5p, miR-15b-5p,
      miR-212-3p, miR-199a-5p, and miR-134-3p than the control rats (all p &lt; 0.001).
      The AMPK signaling pathway was predicted to be regulated by these miRNAs. The
      predicted target genes AKT3, SIRT1, and PRKAA1 were highly expressed in
      noise-exposed rats. In CN of noise-exposed rats, the miRNAs of miR-758-5p,
      miR-15b-5p, miR-212-3p, miR-199a-5p, and miR-134-3p were reduced and related to
      AMPK signaling including AKT3 and SIRT1 expression. These modulation of signaling
      pathways could mediate the increased expression of brevican in the CN of
      noise-exposed rats.

TI  - Determination of the Metabolites and Metabolic Pathways for Three beta-Receptor
      Agonists in Rats Based on LC-MS/MS.

LID - 10.3390/ani12151885 [doi]
AB  - This paper developed a universal detection method by high-performance liquid
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to detect three typical clenbuterols,
      CLB, SAL, and RAC, and to investigate the metabolism of beta-agonists in vivo.
      The parent ions and daughter ions of the three beta-receptor agonist standards
      and the residues in the muscle, liver, and blood samples of rats were obtained by
      Total Ions Scan mode. The metabolites produced in different tissues at a specific
      time were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed, and the corresponding
      metabolic pathways were inferred. The results showed that the three beta-receptor
      agonists mainly existed in the form of prototype drugs in rats, with a small
      amount of clenbuterol methyl compound and albuterol methyl compound. There were
      significant differences in residual metabolism between different tissues of the
      same species. In addition, different beta-receptor agonists have different
      absorption and utilization rates in rats.

TI  - Effects of Dietary Lysine Levels on Growth Performance, Nutrient Digestibility,
      Serum Metabolites, and Meat Quality of Baqing Pigs.
LID - 1884 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ani12151884 [doi]
AB  - This study was carried out to determine the Lys requirements of Baqing pigs and
      the effects of different dietary lysine levels on growth performance, apparent
      nutrient digestibility, serum metabolites, and carcass and meat traits. A total
      of 120 castrated Baqing pigs were selected by body weight and randomly assigned
      to five dietary treatments with six replicate pens (4 pigs per pen, castrated)
      per treatment in a randomized complete block design. Five diets in mash form were
      formulated to contain SID Lys at 0.56%, 0.68%, 0.80%, 0.92%, and 1.04% of diet in
      phase 1 (20-40 kg), at 0.45%, 0.54%, 0.63%, 0.72%, and 0.81% of diet in phase 2
      (40-60 kg), and at 0.39%, 0.47%, 0.55%, 0.63%, and 0.71% of diet in phase 3
      (60-90 kg), respectively. The results showed that the bodyweight of pigs was not 
      affected by dietary SID Lys content during each period. However, the addition of 
      dietary SID Lys linearly reduced F/G in the first period and quadratically
      increased ADG during the second period (p &lt; 0.05). The digestible energy (DE) 
      was increased linearly and quadratically in the first phases with the dietary
      increased SID Lys levels, while DE was reduced in the third and second phases (p 
      &lt; 0.05). Increasing SID Lys contents linearly increased the serum TG
      concentration and quadratically decreased the serum GLU concentration, while
      linearly reducing the serum HDLC concentration of first period pigs (p &lt;
      0.05). Serum concentrations of TP, TG, TC, and LDLC were increased linearly with 
      the increasing dietary SID Lys levels in the second period (p &lt; 0.05). The
      serum concentrations of Lys increased quadratically, and histidine increased
      linearly with the increased dietary SID Lys levels (p &lt; 0.05). Compared with
      the treatment three group, dietary SID Lys addition content at treatment four
      increased the shear force of the longissimus dorsi muscle (p &lt; 0.05), but it
      did not affect the other carcass and meat traits. The optimal SID Lys requirement
      of 20-40 kg, 40-60 kg, and 60-90 kg of Baqing pigs fed corn-soybean meal-based
      diets is estimated to be 0.92%, 0.66%, and 0.55% of the diets by the quadratic
      curve models, respectively.

LID - 10.3390/diagnostics12081792 [doi]
AB  - This study was aimed to investigate the applicability of the exosome
      fluorescence-lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) for colorectal cancer (CRC)
      diagnosis. Differential ultra-centrifugation was used to extract exosomes from
      the blood plasma of 11 patients with colon polyps (CPs) and 13 patients with CRC 
      at the T2-4, N0-3, and M0-1 stages. Analysis was performed using a two-photon
      FLIM device. In total, 165 and 195 FLIM images were recorded for the CP and CCR
      patient groups, respectively. Two classes of exosomes differentiated by
      autofluorescence average lifetime tm&amp;nbsp;were discovered in the samples. The
      first class of exosomes with tm = (0.21 +/- 0.06) ns was mostly found in samples 
      from CRC patients. The second class with tm = (0.43 +/- 0.19) ns was mostly found
      in samples from CP patients. The relative number of "CRC-associated" exosomes
      Nch&amp;nbsp;in the FLIM dataset was shown to be very small for the CP patient
      group and large for the CRC patient group. This difference was statistically
      significant. Therefore, the suggested CRS diagnostics criterion can be as
      follows. If Nch &gt; 0.5, the probability of CRC is high. If Nch &lt; 0.3, the
      probability of CRC is low.

      FL/MRI Imaging and Cancer Theranostics.
LID - 558 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/bios12080558 [doi]
AB  - Tumor accurate imaging can effectively guide tumor resection and accurate
      follow-up targeted therapy. The development of imaging-stable, safe, and
      metabolizable contrast agents is key to accurate tumor imaging. Herein,
      ultra-small and metabolizable dual-mode imaging probe Au/Gd@FA NCs is rationally 
      engineered by a simple hydrothermal method to achieve accurate FL/MRI imaging of 
      tumors. The probes exhibit ultra-small size (2.5-3.0 nm), near-infrared
      fluorescence (690 nm), high quantum yield (4.4%), and a better T1 nuclear
      magnetic signal compared to commercial MRI contrast agents. By modifying the
      folic acid (FA) molecules, the uptake and targeting of the probes are effectively
      improved, enabling specific fluorescence imaging of breast cancer. Au/Gd@FA NCs
      with good biosafety were found to be excreted in the feces after imaging without 
      affecting the normal physiological metabolism of mice. Intracellular reactive
      oxygen species (ROS) increased significantly after incubation of Au/Gd@FA NCs
      with tumor cells under 660 nm laser irradiation, indicating that Au/Gd@FA NCs can
      promote intracellular ROS production and effectively induce cell apoptosis. Thus,
      metabolizable Au/Gd@FA NCs provide a potential candidate probe for multimodal
      imaging and tumor diagnosis in clinical basic research. Meanwhile, Au/Gd@FA NCs
      mediated excessive intracellular production of ROS that could help promote tumor 
      cell death.

      convolution features. Four sets of experiments using 4500 samples were conducted 
      to verify model performance. Simultaneously, feature visualization technology was
      used to extract the three-layer features obtained by the model, and a scatterplot
      analysis was performed. The proposed model achieved a very high accuracy of
      93.7%, and the extracted features exhibited the best separability among the
      tested models. We found that adding redundant layers did not improve model
      performance, and removing the data of specific channels did not significantly
      reduce the classification effect of the model. These results indicate that the
      proposed model allows for emotion recognition with a higher accuracy and speed
      than the previously reported models. We believe that our approach can be
      implemented in various applications that require the quick and accurate
      identification of human emotions.

TI  - Patients with Methamphetamine Use Disorder Show Highly Utilized Proactive
      Inhibitory Control and Intact Reactive Inhibitory Control with Long-Term
      Abstinence.
LID - 974 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/brainsci12080974 [doi]
AB  - Methamphetamine use disorder (MUD) is a chronic brain disorder that involves
      frequent failures of inhibitory control and relapses into methamphetamine intake.
      However, it remains unclear whether the impairment of inhibitory control in MUD
      is proactive, reactive or both. To address this issue, the current study used the
      conditional stop-signal task to assess proactive and reactive inhibitory control 
      in 35 MUD patients with long-term abstinence and 35 matched healthy controls. The
      results showed that MUD patients with long-term abstinence had greater
      preparation costs than healthy controls, but did not differ in performance,
      implying a less efficient utilization of proactive inhibitory control. In
      contrast, MUD patients exhibited intact reactive inhibitory control; reactive but
      not proactive inhibitory control was associated with high sensation seeking in
      MUD patients with long-term abstinence. These findings suggest that proactive and
      reactive inhibitory control may be two different important endophenotypes of
      addiction in MUD patients with long-term abstinence. The current study provides
      new insight into the uses of proactive and reactive inhibitory control to
      effectively evaluate and precisely treat MUD patients with long-term abstinence.

TI  - Highly Virulent and Multidrug-Resistant Escherichia coli Sequence Type 58 from a 
      Sausage in Germany.
LID - 1006 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/antibiotics11081006 [doi]
AB  - Studies have previously described the occurrence of multidrug-resistant (MDR)
      Escherichia&amp;nbsp;coli in human and veterinary medical settings, livestock,
      and, to a lesser extent, in the environment and food. While they mostly analyzed 
      foodborne E.&amp;nbsp;coli regarding phenotypic and sometimes genotypic
      antibiotic resistance and basic phylogenetic classification, we have limited
      understanding of the in vitro and in vivo virulence characteristics and global
      phylogenetic contexts of these bacteria. Here, we investigated in-depth an E.
      coli strain (PBIO3502) isolated from a pork sausage in Germany in 2021.
      Whole-genome sequence analysis revealed sequence type (ST)58, which has an
      internationally emerging high-risk clonal lineage. In addition to its MDR
      phenotype that mostly matched the genotype, PBIO3502 demonstrated pronounced
      virulence features, including in vitro biofilm formation, siderophore secretion, 
      serum resilience, and in vivo mortality in Galleria&amp;nbsp;mellonella larvae.
      Along with the genomic analysis indicating close phylogenetic relatedness of our 
      strain with publicly available, clinically relevant representatives of the same
      ST, these results suggest the zoonotic and pathogenic character of PBIO3502 with 
      the potential to cause infection in humans and animals. Additionally, our study
      highlights the necessity of the One Health approach while integrating human,
      animal, and environmental health, as well as the role of meat products and food
      chains in the putative transmission of MDR pathogens.

TI  - The Neural Control Mechanisms of Gekkonid Adhesion Locomotion: The Effect of
      Spinal Cord Lesions.
LID - 98 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/biomimetics7030098 [doi]
AB  - Objective: the role of the supraspinal system in the neural control mechanisms of
      adhesion locomotor pattern formation was studied in lizard Gekko gecko. Methods: 
      the locomotor performance and adaptation of the chronically lesioned Gekko gecko 
      was documented before and after either partial or complete spinal lesions. They
      were filmed moving on a flat and smooth platform that was inclined at 0 degrees ,
      +/-45 degrees , and +/-90 degrees , as well as the horizontal mats and the
      vertical oak background board in the terraria, to evaluate locomotor functional
      recovery. The geckos were also tested on the platform by two half and nose-up or 
      -down rotations in steps of 15 degrees throughout 180 degrees to investigate the 
      recovery of the ability to respond dynamically to external perturbations.
      Results: after relatively small lesions of a hemisection, the locomotor
      performance was largely indistinguishable from that before and after a sham
      operation. During the initial period of recovery after the largest lesions of a
      dorsal or a ventral hemisection within 1 wk, the geckos behaved essentially as
      the complete spinal geckos, while permanent deficits in locomotor performance
      remained and did not decrease afterwards for >/=6 mth. Conclusions: by analyzing 
      the correlation among locomotor performances, and between locomotor performances 
      and spinal cord lesions, we suggest that the dorsal spinal pathways and ventral
      spinal pathways participate, respectively, in the control of the limb coupling,
      and in the deployment and the detachment of the adhesive apparatus. The present
      study will provide certain neurobiological guidance for the design of bio-robots,
      as well as sprawling robots inspired by the geckos.

TI  - The chloroplast plays a central role in facilitating MAMP-Triggered Immunity,
      pathogen suppression of immunity and crosstalk with abiotic stress.
LID - 10.1111/pce.14408 [doi]
AB  - Microbe associated molecular pattern (MAMP) triggered immunity research has
      traditionally centred around signal transduction pathways originating from
      activated membrane localised pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), culminating in
      nuclear transcription and post translational modifications. More recently,
      chloroplasts have emerged as key immune signalling hubs, playing a central role
      in integrating environmental signals. Notably, MAMP recognition induces
      chloroplastic ROS (cROS) which is suppressed by pathogen effectors, which also
      modify the balance of chloroplast-synthesised precursors of the defence hormones,
      jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA) and abscisic acid (ABA). This study
      focuses on how well characterised PRRs and co-receptors modulate chloroplast
      physiology, examining whether diverse signalling pathways converge to similarly
      modulate chloroplast function. Pre-treatment of receptor mutant plants with MAMP 
      and D(Damage)AMP peptides usually protect against effector modulation of
      chlorophyll fluorescence and prevent Pseudomonas syringae effector mediated
      quenching of cROS and suppression of maximum dark-adapted quantum ef fi ciency
      (Fv /Fm ). The MAMP-triggered immunity (MTI) co-receptor double mutant,
      bak1-5/bkk1-1, exhibits a remarkable decrease in Fv /Fm compared to control
      plants during infection, underlining the importance of MTI mediated signalling in
      chloroplast immunity. Further probing the role of the chloroplast in immunity we 
      unexpectedly found that even moderate changes in light intensity can uncouple
      plant immune signalling. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

      absorption, barrier function, and intestinal diseases.
LID - 10.1002/jcp.30841 [doi]
AB  - As one of the most important organs in animals, the intestine is responsible for 
      nutrient absorption and acts as a barrier between the body and the environment.
      Intestinal physiology and function require the participation of energy.
      5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a classical and
      highly expressed energy regulator in intestinal cells, regulates the process of
      nutrient absorption and barrier function and is also involved in the therapy of
      intestinal diseases. Studies have yielded findings that AMPK regulates the
      absorption of glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids in the intestine primarily by
      regulating transportation systems, as we detailed here. Moreover, AMPK is
      involved in the regulation of the intestinal mechanical barrier and immune
      barrier through manipulating the expression of tight junctions, antimicrobial
      peptides, and secretory immunoglobulins. In addition, AMPK also participates in
      the regulation of intestinal diseases, which indicates that AMPK is a promising
      therapeutic target for intestinal diseases and cancer. In this review, we
      summarized the current understanding regarding how AMPK regulates intestinal
      nutrient absorption, barrier function, and intestinal diseases.

TI  - Evaluation of the HIV-1 Polymerase Gene Sequence Diversity for Prediction of
      Recent HIV-1 Infections Using Shannon Entropy Analysis.
LID - 1587 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14071587 [doi]
AB  - HIV-1 incidence is an important parameter for assessing the impact of HIV-1
      interventions. The aim of this study was to evaluate HIV-1 polymerase (pol) gene 
      sequence diversity for the prediction of recent HIV-1 infections. Complete pol
      Sanger sequences obtained from 45 participants confirmed to have recent or
      chronic HIV-1 infection were used. Shannon entropy was calculated for amino acid 
      (aa) sequences for the entire pol and for sliding windows consisting of 50 aa
      each. Entropy scores for the complete HIV-1 pol were significantly higher in
      chronic compared to recent HIV-1 infections (p &lt; 0.0001) and the same pattern 
      was observed for some sliding windows (p-values ranging from 0.011 to &lt;0.001),
      leading to the identification of some aa mutations that could discriminate
      between recent and chronic infection. Different aa mutation groups were assessed 
      for predicting recent infection and their performance ranged from 64.3% to 100%
      but had a high false recency rate (FRR), which was decreased to 19.4% when
      another amino acid mutation (M456) was included in the analysis. The pol-based
      molecular method identified in this study would not be ideal for use on its own
      due to high FRR; however, this method could be considered for complementing
      existing serological assays to further reduce FRR.

TI  - Antiviral Effect of hBD-3 and LL-37 during Human Primary Keratinocyte Infection
      with West Nile Virus.
LID - 1552 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14071552 [doi]
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) is an emerging flavivirus transmitted through mosquito
      bites and responsible for a wide range of clinical manifestations. Following
      their inoculation within the skin, flaviviruses replicate in keratinocytes of the
      epidermis, inducing an innate immune response including the production of
      antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Among them, the cathelicidin LL-37 and the human
      beta-defensin (hBD)-3 are known for their antimicrobial and immunomodulatory
      properties. We assessed their role during WNV infection of human primary
      keratinocytes. LL-37 reduced the viral load in the supernatant of infected
      keratinocytes and of the titer of a viral inoculum incubated in the presence of
      the peptide, suggesting a direct antiviral effect of this AMP. Conversely, WNV
      replication was not inhibited by hBD-3. The two peptides then demonstrated
      immunomodulatory properties whether in the context of keratinocyte stimulation by
      poly(I:C) or infection by WNV, but not alone. This study demonstrates the
      immunostimulatory properties of these two skin AMPs at the initial site of WNV
      replication and the ability of LL-37 to directly inactivate West Nile viral
      infectious particles. The results provide new information on the multiple
      functions of these two peptides and underline the potential of AMPs as new
      antiviral strategies in the fight against flaviviral infections.

      Urodynamic, Scintigraphic and Radiological Aspects.
LID - 1512 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14071512 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Describing the urodynamic parameters of children aged 3 to 5 years with
      microcephaly related to congenital Zika syndrome and verifying the association
      with clinical, imaging and neurological characteristics. METHODS: From October
      2018 to March 2020, children with Zika-related microcephaly underwent urological,
      ultrasonographic and urodynamic evaluation. In selected cases, complementary
      exams such as urethrocystography and scintigraphy were performed. The children
      also underwent a complete neurological evaluation. To compare frequency between
      groups, we used Pearson's chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: This 
      study evaluated 40 children, of whom 85% were 4 years old, and all had
      abnormalities on the urodynamic study, with low bladder capacity (92.5%) and
      detrusor overactivity (77.5%) as the most frequent findings. Only three children 
      had ultrasound abnormalities, but no child had cystographic or scintigraphic
      abnormalities, and the postvoid residual volume was normal in 80% of cases. In
      spite of a frequency of 67.5% of intestinal constipation, there was no record of 
      febrile urinary tract infection after the first year of life. All children
      presented severe microcephaly and at least one neurological abnormality in
      addition to microcephaly. The homogeneity of the children in relation to
      microcephaly severity and neurological abnormalities limited the study of the
      association with the urodynamic parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Urodynamic abnormalities
      in children aged 3 to 5 years with Zika-related microcephaly do not seem to
      characterize a neurogenic bladder with immediate risks for the upper urinary
      tract. The satisfactory bladder emptying suggests that the voiding pattern is
      reflex.

LID - 10.3390/v14071471 [doi]
AB  - Waterfowl parvovirus (WPFs) has multiple effects on the intestinal tract, but the
      effects of recombinant Muscovy duck parvovirus (rMDPV) have not been elucidated. 
      In this study, 48 one-day-old Muscovy ducklings were divided into an infected
      group and a control group. Plasma and ileal samples were collected from both
      groups at 2, 4, 6, and 8 days post-infection (dpi), both six ducklings at a time.
      Next, we analyzed the genomic sequence of the rMDPV strain. Results showed that
      the ileal villus structure was destroyed seriously at 4, 6, 8 dpi, and the
      expression of ZO-1, Occludin, and Claudin-1 decreased at 4, 6 dpi; 4, 6, 8 dpi;
      and 2, 6 dpi, respectively. Intestinal cytokines IFN-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6
      increased at 6 dpi; 8 dpi; and 6, 8 dpi, respectively, whereas IL-2 decreased at 
      6, 8 dpi. The diversity of ileal flora increased significantly at 4 dpi and
      decreased at 8 dpi. The bacteria Ochrobactrum and Enterococcus increased and
      decreased at 4, 8 dpi; 2, 4 dpi, respectively. Plasma MDA increased at 2 dpi,
      SOD, CAT, and T-AOC decreased at 2, 4, 8 dpi; 4, 8 dpi; and 4, 6, 8 dpi,
      respectively. These results suggest that rMDPV infection led to early intestinal 
      barrier dysfunction, inflammation, ileac microbiota disruption, and oxidative
      stress.

TI  - Molecular Characterization of a Novel Polerovirus Infecting Soybean in China.
LID - 1428 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14071428 [doi]
AB  - Poleroviruses are positive-sense, single-stranded viruses. In this study, we
      describe the identification of a novel polerovirus isolated from soybean
      displaying curled leaves. The complete viral genome sequence was identified using
      high-throughput sequencing and confirmed using rapid amplification of cDNA ends
      (RACE), RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. Its genome organization is typical of the
      members of genus Polerovirus, containing seven putative open reading frames
      (ORFs). The full genome is composed of single-stranded RNA of 5822 nucleotides in
      length, with the highest nucleotide sequence identity (79.07% with 63% coverage) 
      for cowpea polerovirus 2 (CPPV2). Amino acid sequence identities of the protein
      products between the virus and its relatives are below the threshold determined
      by the International Committee of Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) for species
      demarcation, and this strongly supports this virus' status as a novel species,
      for which the name soybean chlorotic leafroll virus (SbCLRV) is proposed.
      Recombination analysis identified a recombination event in the ORF5 of the 3'
      portion in the genome. Phylogenetic analyses of the genome and encoded protein
      sequences revealed that the new virus is closely related to phasey bean mild
      yellows virus, CPPV2 and siratro latent polerovirus. Subsequently, we
      demonstrated the infectivity of SbCLRV in Nicotiana benthamiana via infectious
      cDNA clone generation and agroinoculation.

TI  - Genomic Comparisons of Alphacoronaviruses and Betacoronaviruses from Korean Bats.
LID - 1389 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14071389 [doi]
AB  - Coronaviruses are well known as a diverse family of viruses that affect a wide
      range of hosts. Since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, a
      variety of bat-associated coronaviruses have been identified in many countries.
      However, they do not represent all the specific geographic locations of their
      hosts. In this study, full-length genomes representing newly identified bat
      coronaviruses in South Korea were obtained using an RNA sequencing approach. The 
      analysis, based on genome structure, conserved replicase domains, spike gene, and
      nucleocapsid genes revealed that bat Alphacoronaviruses are from three different 
      viral species. Among them, the newly identified B20-97 strain may represent a new
      putative species, closely related to PEDV. In addition, the newly-identified
      MERS-related coronavirus exhibited shared genomic nucleotide identities of less
      than 76.4% with other Merbecoviruses. Recombination analysis and multiple
      alignments of spike and RBD amino acid sequences suggested that this strain
      underwent recombination events and could possibly use hDPP4 molecules as its
      receptor. The bat SARS-related CoV B20-50 is unlikely to be able to use hACE2 as 
      its receptor and lack of an open reading frame in ORF8 gene region. Our results
      illustrate the diversity of coronaviruses in Korean bats and their evolutionary
      relationships. The evolution of the bat coronaviruses related ORF8 accessory gene
      is also discussed.

TI  - A Comparison of Pseudorabies Virus Latency to Other alpha-Herpesvirinae Subfamily
      Members.
LID - 1386 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14071386 [doi]
AB  - Pseudorabies virus (PRV), the causative agent of Aujeszky's disease, is one of
      the most important infectious pathogens threatening the global pig industry. Like
      other members of alphaherpesviruses, PRV establishes a lifelong latent infection 
      and occasionally reactivates from latency after stress stimulus in infected pigs.
      Latent infected pigs can then serve as the source of recurrent infection, which
      is one of the difficulties for PRV eradication. Virus latency refers to the
      retention of viral complete genomes without production of infectious progeny
      virus; however, following stress stimulus, the virus can be reactivated into
      lytic infection, which is known as the latency-reactivation cycle. Recently,
      several research have indicated that alphaherpesvirus latency and reactivation is
      regulated by a complex interplay between virus, neurons, and the immune system.
      However, with those limited reports, the relevant advances in PRV latency are
      lagging behind. Therefore, in this review we focus on the regulatory mechanisms
      in PRV latency via summarizing the progress of PRV itself and that of other
      alphaherpesviruses, which will improve our understanding in the underlying
      mechanism of PRV latency and help design novel therapeutic strategies to control 
      PRV latency.

TI  - High-Throughput Screening of FDA-Approved Drug Library Reveals Ixazomib Is a
      Broad-Spectrum Antiviral Agent against Arboviruses.
LID - 1381 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14071381 [doi]
AB  - The emergence of significant arboviruses and their spillover transmission to
      humans represent a major threat to global public health. No approved drugs are
      available for the treatment of significant arboviruses in circulation today. The 
      repurposing of clinically approved drugs is one of the most rapid and promising
      strategies in the identification of effective treatments for diseases caused by
      arboviruses. Here, we screened small-molecule compounds with anti-tick-borne
      encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, yellow fever virus and chikungunya virus
      activity from 2580 FDA-approved drugs. In total, 60 compounds showed antiviral
      efficacy against all four of the arboviruses in Huh7 cells. Among these
      compounds, ixazomib and ixazomib citrate (inhibitors of 20S proteasome beta5)
      exerted antiviral effects at a low-micromolar concentration. The
      time-of-drug-addition assay suggested that ixazomib and ixazomib citrate
      disturbed multiple processes in viruses' life cycles. Furthermore, ixazomib and
      ixazomib citrate potently inhibited chikungunya virus replication and relieved
      virus-induced footpad swelling in a mouse model. These results offer critical
      information which supports the role of ixazomib as a broad-spectrum agent against
      arboviruses.

TI  - The Antifungal Itraconazole Is a Potent Inhibitor of Chikungunya Virus
      Replication.
LID - 1351 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14071351 [doi]
AB  - Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is the causative agent of chikungunya fever, a
      disabling disease that can cause long-term severe arthritis. Since the last large
      CHIKV outbreak in 2015, the reemergence of the virus represents a serious public 
      health concern. The morbidity associated with viral infection emphasizes the need
      for the development of specific anti-CHIKV drugs. Herein, we describe the
      development and characterization of a CHIKV reporter replicon cell line and its
      use in replicon-based screenings. We tested 960 compounds from MMV/DNDi Open Box 
      libraries and identified four candidates with interesting antiviral activities,
      which were confirmed in viral infection assays employing CHIKV-nanoluc and BHK-21
      cells. The most noteworthy compound identified was itraconazole (ITZ), an orally 
      available, safe, and cheap antifungal, that showed high selectivity indexes of
      &gt;312 and &gt;294 in both replicon-based and viral infection assays,
      respectively. The antiviral activity of this molecule has been described against 
      positive-sense single stranded RNA viruses (+ssRNA) and was related to
      cholesterol metabolism that could affect the formation of the replication
      organelles. Although its precise mechanism of action against CHIKV still needs to
      be elucidated, our results demonstrate that ITZ is a potent inhibitor of the
      viral replication that could be repurposed as a broad-spectrum antiviral.

TI  - ARNT Inhibits H5N1 Influenza A Virus Replication by Interacting with the PA
      Protein.
LID - 1347 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14071347 [doi]
AB  - Increasing evidence suggests that the polymerase acidic (PA) protein of influenza
      A viruses plays an important role in viral replication and pathogenicity.
      However, information regarding the interaction(s) of host factors with PA is
      scarce. By using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified a novel host factor,
      aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT), that interacts with the PA
      protein of the H5N1 virus. The interaction between PA and human ARNT was
      confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence microscopy. Moreover, 
      overexpression of ARNT downregulated the polymerase activity and inhibited virus 
      propagation, whereas knockdown of ARNT significantly increased the polymerase
      activity and virus replication. Mechanistically, overexpression of ARNT resulted 
      in the accumulation of PA protein in the nucleus and inhibited both the
      replication and transcription of the viral genome. Interaction domain mapping
      revealed that the bHLH/PAS domain of ARNT mainly interacted with the C-terminal
      domain of PA. Together, our results demonstrate that ARNT inhibits the
      replication of the H5N1 virus and could be a target for the development of
      therapeutic strategies against H5N1 influenza viruses.

TI  - Effective Functional Immunogenicity of a DNA Vaccine Combination Delivered via In
      Vivo Electroporation Targeting Malaria Infection and Transmission.
LID - 1134 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/vaccines10071134 [doi]
AB  - Plasmodium falciparum&amp;nbsp;circumsporozoite protein (PfCSP) and Pfs25 are
      leading candidates for the development of pre-erythrocytic and
      transmission-blocking vaccines (TBV), respectively. Although considerable
      progress has been made in developing PfCSP- and Pfs25-based vaccines, neither
      have elicited complete protection or transmission blocking in clinical trials.
      The combination of antigens targeting various life stages is an alternative
      strategy to develop a more efficacious malaria vaccine. In this study, female and
      male mice were immunized with DNA plasmids encoding PfCSP and Pfs25, administered
      alone or in combination via intramuscular in vivo electroporation (EP).
      Antigen-specific antibodies were analyzed for antibody titers, avidity and
      isotype by ELISA. Immune protection against sporozoite challenge, using
      transgenic P. berghei expressing PfCSP and a GFP-luciferase fusion protein
      (PbPfCSP-GFP/Luc), was assessed by in vivo bioluminescence imaging and
      blood-stage parasite growth. Transmission reducing activity (TRA) was evaluated
      in standard membrane feeding assays (SMFA). High levels of PfCSP- and
      Pfs25-specific antibodies were induced in mice immunized with either DNA vaccine 
      alone or in combination. No difference in antibody titer and avidity was observed
      for both PfCSP and Pfs25 between the single DNA and combined DNA immunization
      groups. When challenged by PbPfCSP-GFP/Luc sporozoites, mice immunized with PfCSP
      alone or combined with Pfs25 revealed significantly reduced liver-stage parasite 
      loads as compared to mice immunized with Pfs25, used as a control. Furthermore,
      parasite liver loads were negatively correlated with PfCSP-specific antibody
      levels. When evaluating TRA, we found that immunization with Pfs25 alone or in
      combination with PfCSP elicited comparable significant transmission reduction.
      Our studies reveal that the combination of PfCSP and Pfs25 DNAs into a vaccine
      delivered by in vivo EP in mice does not compromise immunogenicity, infection
      protection and transmission reduction when compared to each DNA vaccine
      individually, and provide support for further evaluation of this DNA combination 
      vaccine approach in larger animals and clinical trials.

TI  - The Association between Risk Perception and Hesitancy toward the Booster Dose of 
      COVID-19 Vaccine among People Aged 60 Years and Older in China.
LID - 1112 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/vaccines10071112 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Given the prevalence of the omicron variant and decreased immunity
      provided by vaccines, it is imperative to enhance resistance to COVID-19 in the
      old population. We planned to explore the hesitancy rate toward the booster dose 
      of the COVID-19 vaccine and the association between risk perception and the
      abovementioned rate among people aged 60 and older. METHODS: This national
      cross-sectional study was conducted in mainland China from 25 May to 8 June 2022,
      targeting people who were 60 years old or above. Four dimensions were extracted
      from the Health Belief Model (HBM) to assess participants' perceived risk levels,
      including perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived barriers, and
      perceived benefit. An independent Chi-square test was used to compare the vaccine
      hesitancy rates among different groups stratified by characteristics. Univariable
      and multivariable logistic regression models were performed to explore the
      associations between risk perception and hesitancy rate. RESULTS: Of 3321
      participants, 17.2% (95% CI: 15.9-18.5%) were hesitant about booster shots of
      COVID-19 vaccines. Believing that they were ineligible for vaccination due to
      certain illnesses (38.3%), concern about vaccine safety (32.0%), believing the
      booster shots were unnecessary (33.1%), and their limitation on movements (28.0%)
      were the main reasons for vaccine hesitation. Adjusted by all the selected
      covariates, people with low perception level of susceptibility (aOR = 1.39, 95%
      CI: 1.00-1.92) and benefit (low: aOR = 3.31, 95% CI: 2.01-5.45; moderate: aOR =
      2.23, 95% CI: 1.75-2.85) were less likely to receiving the booster dose, and the 
      same results were found in people with higher perceived barriers (moderate: aOR =
      2.67, 95% CI: 2.13-3.35; high: aOR = 2.04, 95% CI: 1.14-3.67). Our estimates were
      stable in all four models. CONCLUSIONS: In total, 17.2% of the people aged 60
      years and older in China were hesitant about booster dose of COVID-19 vaccines,
      and it was closely associated with a lower level of perceived susceptibility and 
      benefit, as well as a higher level of perceived barriers. Concerns about
      contraindications, vaccine safety, and limited movements were the main reasons
      for vaccine hesitancy. Targeted public health measure is a priority to improve
      the understanding of the elderly on their own susceptibility and vulnerability
      and clear the obstacles to vaccination.

TI  - Early Impact of SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic on Immunization Services in Nigeria.
LID - 1107 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/vaccines10071107 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: By 11 March 2022, there were 450,229,635 coronavirus disease
      (COVID-19) cases and 6,019,085 deaths globally, with Nigeria reporting 254,637
      cases and 3142 deaths. One of the essential healthcare services that have been
      impacted by the pandemic is routine childhood immunization. According to the 2018
      National Demographic and Health Survey, only 31% of children aged 12-23 months
      were fully vaccinated in Nigeria, and 19% of eligible children in the country had
      not received any vaccination. A further decline in coverage due to the pandemic
      can significantly increase the risk of vaccine-preventable-disease outbreaks
      among children in Nigeria. To mitigate such an occurrence, it is imperative to
      urgently identify how the pandemic and the response strategies have affected
      vaccination services, hence, the goal of the study. METHODS: The research method 
      was qualitative, including in-depth interviews of healthcare workers and focus
      group discussions (FGDs) with caregivers of children aged 0-23 months. We
      selected one state from each of the three zones of Nigeria: northern, central,
      and southern. Within each state, 10 local government areas and 20 healthcare
      facilities were purposively selected. In each facility, 10 healthcare workers
      were invited for interviews. Overall, 517 healthcare workers were interviewed.
      For the focus group discussion, 30 communities were selected. Within each
      selected community, six consenting caregivers were included. Overall, 180
      caregivers participated. The data were analyzed using thematic inductive content 
      analysis. RESULTS: Three significant impacts that were observed are: difficulties
      in accessibility to immunization services, declining immunization demand and
      uptake among caregivers due to varying factors, and erosion of vaccine confidence
      among both caregivers and healthcare workers. Movement restriction and lockdown
      had numerous major impacts, such as decreased general healthcare service
      delivery, increased transportation costs, fewer engagements that promote vaccine 
      uptake, and cessation of mobile vaccination campaigns that target hard-to-reach
      communities. Moreover, misinformation, conspiracy beliefs about the pandemic and 
      COVID-19 vaccines, and risk perception negatively influenced general vaccine
      confidence. CONCLUSION: The results of this early impact study show that
      immunization was directly affected by the pandemic and provide insights into
      areas where interventions are needed for recovery.

TI  - Durability of Antibody Response after Primary Pneumococcal Double-Dose
      Prime-Boost Vaccination in Adult Kidney Transplant Recipients and Candidates:
      18-Month Follow-Up in a Non-Blinded, Randomised Clinical Trial.
LID - 1091 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/vaccines10071091 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pneumococcal prime-boost vaccination is recommended for solid organ
      transplant recipients and candidates. The long-term durability of the antibody
      (AB) response is unknown. The same applies to a dose-dependent immune response.
      METHODS: We studied the durability of the vaccine response after 18 months in
      kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) and patients on the kidney transplant waiting
      list (WLPs). Both groups received either a normal dose (ND) or a double dose (DD)
      of the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and the 23-valent pneumococcal
      polysaccharide vaccine. The average pneumococcal AB geometric mean concentration 
      (GMC) was evaluated. A level >/= 1 mg/L was considered protective against
      invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). RESULTS: Sixty WLPs and 70 KTRs were
      included. The proportion of participants protected declined from 52% to 33% in
      WLPs and from 29% to 16% in KTRs, with the previously significant dose-effect in 
      WLPs no longer present (40% DD vs. 27% ND; p = 0.273). Average pneumococcal AB
      GMCs remained significantly above baseline levels (all groups p </= 0.001).
      Drug-induced immunosuppression diminished the vaccine dose-effect. CONCLUSIONS:
      At follow-up, the pneumococcal prime-boost vaccination still provided
      significantly elevated average pneumococcal AB GMCs in both populations. Though
      the proportion of participants protected against IPD in WLP-DD and WLP-ND were
      statistically comparable, a DD may still be recommended for WLPs (EudraCT:
      2016-004123-23).

TI  - Factors Influencing Men's Attitudes toward HPV Vaccination in Males Included in
      the Chinese National Immunization Program.
LID - 1054 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/vaccines10071054 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the most common sexually
      transmitted disease, and it is associated with anogenital warts and oropharyngeal
      and anogenital cancers. Among female malignant tumors in China, the incidence of 
      cervical cancer ranks second, with only breast cancer being more prevalent. HPV
      infection and related diseases affects both women and men. HPV vaccination is an 
      optimal prevention strategy in preventing HPV infection and related diseases. The
      inclusion of the HPV vaccine in the national immunization program is an effective
      way to increase immunization coverage, reduce the burden of HPV related diseases,
      and increase national life expectancy. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the
      factors influencing the attitudes of Chinese men toward the inclusion of the HPV 
      vaccine in males included in the national immunization program, thus providing
      reference for launching the national immunization program policy. METHODS: We
      invited men aged 20 to 45 to participate in an online survey. The participants
      were requested to complete a questionnaire, including sociodemographic
      characteristics, sexual behavior characteristics, knowledge of HPV and the HPV
      vaccine, and attitudes toward the HPV vaccine. A logistic regression model was
      constructed to analyze the influencing factors of attitudes. RESULTS: A total of 
      660 males in China participated in this survey, and 80.45% supported the
      inclusion of HPV vaccines in national immunization programs. Participants earning
      CNY 100,000-200,000 (dds ratio (OR): 0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI):
      0.39-1.00) or >/=200,000 (OR: 0.34, 95% CI: 0.17-0.68) were more likely to
      disapprove this strategy. Compared with people without a history of HPV
      infection, those with a history of HPV infection (OR: 1.84, 95% CI: 1.17-2.90)
      were more likely to approve. Men who had better knowledge of HPV were more likely
      to approve than men with less knowledge about HPV (OR: 1.44, 95% CI: 1.17-1.79). 
      Compared with participants who did not know when the HPV vaccine should be given,
      those who knew that the ideal time of vaccination is before an individual becomes
      sexually active (OR: 1.75, 95% CI: 1.04-2.95) were more likely to approve.
      CONCLUSION: One in five men did not support the inclusion of HPV vaccines in
      national immunization programs, and they are likely to be from higher
      socioeconomic background and have poor knowledge of HPV. In order to implement
      comprehensive immunity, targeted actions need to be taken at national and public 
      levels. In addition, when implementing measures, more attention needs to be paid

TI  - Effectiveness of COVID-19 Vaccination in Preventing All-Cause Mortality among
      Adults during the Third Wave of the Epidemic in Hungary: Nationwide Retrospective
      Cohort Study.
LID - 1009 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/vaccines10071009 [doi]
AB  - Our investigation aimed to describe the all-cause mortality rates by COVID-19
      vaccination groups in Hungary for an epidemic period (1 April 2021-20 June 2021) 
      and a nonepidemic period (21 June 2021-15 August 2021), and to determine the
      vaccines' effectiveness in preventing all-cause mortality utilizing nonepidemic
      effectiveness measures to adjust for the healthy vaccinee effect (HVE).
      Sociodemographic status, comorbidity, primary care structural characteristics,
      and HVE-adjusted survival difference between fully vaccinated and unvaccinated
      cohorts in the epidemic period had been computed by Cox regression models,
      separately for each vaccine (six vaccines were available in Hungary). Hazard
      ratio (HR) reduction in epidemic period corrected with nonepidemic period's HR
      with 95% confidence interval for each vaccine was used to describe the vaccine
      effectiveness (VE). The whole adult population (N = 6,404,702) of the country was
      followed in this study (4,026,849 fully vaccinated). Each vaccine could reduce
      the HVE-corrected all-cause mortality in the epidemic period
      (VEOxford/AstraZeneca = 0.592 [0.518-0.655], VEJanssen = 0.754 [0.628-0.838],
      VEModerna = 0.573 [0.526-0.615], VEPfizer-BioNTech = 0.487 [0.461-0.513],
      VESinopharm = 0.530 [0.496-0.561], and VESputnik&amp;nbsp;V = 0.557
      [0.493-0.614]). The HVE-corrected general mortality for COVID-19 vaccine cohorts 
      demonstrated the real-life effectiveness of vaccines applied in Hungary, and the 
      usefulness of this indicator to convince vaccine hesitants.

TI  - Multiple Groups of Agents for Increased Movement Interference and

LID - 5465 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/s22145465 [doi]
AB  - We examined the influence of groups of agents and the type of avatar on movement 
      interference. In addition, we studied the synchronization of the subject with the
      agent. For that, we conducted experiments utilizing human subjects to examine the
      influence of one, two, or three agents, as well as human or robot avatars, and
      finally, the agent moving biologically or linearly. We found the main effect on
      movement interference was the number of agents; namely, three agents had
      significantly more influence on movement interference than one agent. These
      results suggest that the number of agents is more influential on movement
      interference than other avatar characteristics. For the synchronization, the main
      effect of the type of the agent was revealed, showing that the human agent kept
      more synchronization compared to the robotic agent. In this experiment, we
      introduced an additional paradigm on the interference which we called
      synchronization, discovering that a group of agents is able to influence this
      behavioral level as well.

TI  - Identification of Bamboo Species Based on Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
      Using Zhuhai-1 Orbita Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Imagery.
LID - 5434 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/s22145434 [doi]
AB  - Mapping the distribution of bamboo species is vital for the sustainable
      management of bamboo and for assessing its ecological and socioeconomic value.
      However, the spectral similarity between bamboo species makes this work extremely
      challenging through remote sensing technology. Existing related studies rarely
      integrate multiple feature variables and consider how to quantify the main
      factors affecting classification. Therefore, feature variables, such as spectra, 
      topography, texture, and vegetation indices, were used to construct the XGBoost
      model to identify bamboo species using the Zhuhai-1 Orbita hyperspectral (OHS)
      imagery in the Southern Sichuan Bamboo Sea and its surrounding areas in Sichuan
      Province, China. The random forest and Spearman's rank correlation analysis were 
      used to sort the main variables that affect classification accuracy and minimize 
      the effects of multicollinearity among variables. The main findings were: (1) The
      XGBoost model achieved accurate and reliable classification results. The XGBoost 
      model had a higher overall accuracy (80.6%), kappa coefficient (0.708), and mean 
      F1-score (0.805) than the spectral angle mapper (SAM) method; (2) The optimal
      feature variables that were important and uncorrelated for classification
      accuracy included the blue band (B1, 464-468 nm), near-infrared band (B27,
      861-871 nm), green band (B5, 534-539 nm), elevation, texture feature mean, green 
      band (B4, 517-523 nm), and red edge band (B17, 711-720 nm); and (3) the XGBoost
      model based on the optimal feature variable selection showed good adaptability to
      land classification and had better classification performance. Moreover, the mean
      F1-score indicated that the model could well balance the user's and producer's
      accuracy. Additionally, our study demonstrated that OHS imagery has great
      potential for land cover classification and that combining multiple features to
      enhance classification is an approach worth exploring. Our study provides a
      methodological reference for the application of OHS images for plant species
      identification.

TI  - Color Design Decisions for Ceramic Products Based on Quantification of Perceptual
      Characteristics.
LID - 5415 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/s22145415 [doi]
AB  - The appearance characteristics of ceramic color are an important factor in
      determining the user's aesthetic perception of the product. Given the problem
      that ceramic color varies and the user's visual sensory evaluation of color is
      highly subjective and uncertain, a method of quantifying ceramic color
      characteristics based on the Back Propagation (BP) neural network algorithm is
      proposed. The semantic difference method and statistical method were used to
      obtain quantified data from ceramic color perceptual semantic features and were
      combined with a neural network to study the association between ceramic color
      features and user perceptual-cognitive evaluation. A BP neural network was used
      to build a ceramic color perceptual semantic mapping model, using color semantic 
      quantified values as the input layer, color L, A, and B component values as the
      output layer, and model training to predict the sample. The output color L, A,
      and B components are used as the input layer and the color scheme was designed.
      The above method can effectively solve the mapping problem between the appearance
      characteristics of ceramic color and perceptual semantics and provide a decision 
      basis for ceramic product color design. The case application of color design of
      daily-use ceramic products was conducted to verify the effectiveness and
      feasibility of the quantitative research method of ceramic color imagery.

TI  - Water Quality Measurement and Modelling Based on Deep Learning Techniques: Case
      Study for the Parameter of Secchi Disk.
LID - 5399 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/s22145399 [doi]
AB  - The Secchi disk is often used to monitor the transparency of water. However, the 
      results of personal measurement are easily affected by subjective experience and 
      objective environment, and it is time-consuming. With the rapid development of
      computer technology, using image processing technology is more objective and
      accurate than personal observation. A transparency measurement algorithm is
      proposed by combining deep learning, image processing technology, and Secchi disk
      measurement. The white part of the Secchi disk is cropped by image processing.
      The classification network based on resnet18 is applied to classify the
      segmentation results and determine the critical position of the Secchi disk.
      Then, the semantic segmentation network Deeplabv3+ is used to segment the
      corresponding water gauge at this position, and subsequently segment the
      characters on the water gauge. The segmentation results are classified by the
      classification network based on resnet18. Finally, the transparency value is
      calculated according to the segmentation and classification results. The results 
      from this algorithm are more accurate and objective than that of personal
      observation. The experiments show the effectiveness of this algorithm.

TI  - A Novel Efficient Convolutional Neural Algorithm for Multi-Category Aliasing
      Hardware Recognition.
LID - 5358 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/s22145358 [doi]
AB  - When performing robotic automatic sorting and assembly operations of
      multi-category hardware, there are some problems with the existing convolutional 
      neural network visual recognition algorithms, such as large computing power
      consumption, low recognition efficiency, and a high rate of missed detection and 
      false detection. A novel efficient convolutional neural algorithm for
      multi-category aliasing hardware recognition is proposed in this paper. On the
      basis of SSD, the novel algorithm uses Resnet-50 instead of VGG16 as the backbone
      feature extraction network, and it integrates ECA-Net and Improved Spatial
      Attention Block (ISAB): two attention mechanisms to improve the ability of
      learning and extract target features. Then, we pass the weighted features to
      extra feature layers to build an improved SSD algorithm. At last, in order to
      compare the performance difference between the novel algorithm and the existing
      algorithms, three kinds of hardware with different sizes are chosen to constitute
      an aliasing scene that can simulate an industrial site, and some comparative
      experiments have been completed finally. The experimental results show that the
      novel algorithm has an mAP of 98.20% and FPS of 78, which are better than Faster 
      R-CNN, YOLOv4, YOLOXs, EfficientDet-D1, and original SSD in terms of
      comprehensive performance. The novel algorithm proposed in this paper can improve
      the efficiency of robotic sorting and assembly of multi-category hardware.

TI  - Design of Gas Monitoring Terminal Based on Quadrotor UAV.
LID - 5350 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/s22145350 [doi]
AB  - The problem of air pollution is an increasingly serious worldwide. Therefore, in 
      order to better monitor the gas components in the atmosphere, the design of a gas
      monitoring terminal based on a quadrotor UAV, including software and hardware
      design, is hereby carried out. Besides, a pump-suction series cavity is designed 
      to reduce the influence of airflow disturbance on the UAV, which is verified to
      possess a certain anti-interference ability through Computational Fluid
      Dynamics(CFD) simulation experiments. In addition, a linear regression algorithm 
      is used for sensor calibration and a polynomial piecewise regression method is
      used for temperature compensation. The experimental results show that the R(2) of
      the model reaches 0.9981, the fitting degree is rather high, and the output is
      closer to the real gas concentration value after calibration. At the same time,
      the temperature compensation parameters are determined, which considerably
      improves the accuracy of the entire hardware terminal. Finally, the vehicle
      exhaust monitoring experiment is conducted, and the experimental results show
      that this scheme can successfully detect the exhaust position of the vehicle
      exhaust under the interference of the downwash flow of the UAV, thereby proving
      the reliability and accuracy of the monitoring terminal.

TI  - Localization of Dielectric Anomalies with Multi-Monostatic S11 Using 2D MUSIC
      Algorithm with Spatial Smoothing.
LID - 5293 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/s22145293 [doi]
AB  - This article demonstrates that the complex value of S11 of an antenna, acquired
      in a multi-monostatic configuration, can be used for localization of a dielectric
      anomaly hidden inside a dielectric background medium when the antenna is placed
      close (~5 mm) to the geometry. It uses an Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar (ISAR)
      imaging framework where data is acquired at multiple frequencies and look-angles.
      Initially, near-field scattering data are used for simulation to validate this
      methodology since the basic derivation of the Multiple Signal Classification
      (MUSIC) algorithm is based on the plain wave assumption. Later on, from an
      applications perspective, data acquisition is performed using an antipodal
      Vivaldi antenna that has eight constant-width slots on each arm. This antenna
      operates in a frequency range of 1 to 8.5 GHz and its S11 is fed to the 2D MUSIC 
      algorithm with spatial smoothing whereas the antenna artifact and background
      effect are removed by subtracting the average S11 at each antenna location.
      Measurements reveal that this methodology gives accurate results with both
      homogeneous and inhomogeneous backgrounds because the size of data sub-arrays
      trades between the image noise and resolution, hence reducing the effect of
      inhomogeneity in the background. In addition to near-field ISAR imaging, this
      study can be used in the ongoing research on breast tumors and brain stroke
      detection, among others.

TI  - Fair Facial Attribute Classification via Causal Graph-Based Attribute
      Translation.
LID - 5271 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/s22145271 [doi]
AB  - Recent studies have raised concerns regarding racial and gender disparity in
      facial attribute classification performance. As these attributes are directly and
      indirectly correlated with the sensitive attribute in a complex manner, simple
      disparate treatment is ineffective in reducing performance disparity. This paper 
      focuses on achieving counterfactual fairness for facial attribute classification.
      Each labeled input image is used to generate two synthetic replicas: one under
      factual assumptions about the sensitive attribute and one under counterfactual.
      The proposed causal graph-based attribute translation generates realistic
      counterfactual images that consider the complicated causal relationship among the
      attributes with an encoder-decoder framework. A causal graph represents complex
      relationships among the attributes and is used to sample factual and
      counterfactual facial attributes of the given face image. The encoder-decoder
      architecture translates the given facial image to have sampled factual or
      counterfactual attributes while preserving its identity. The attribute classifier
      is trained for fair prediction with counterfactual regularization between factual
      and corresponding counterfactual translated images. Extensive experimental
      results on the CelebA dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability 
      of the proposed learning method for classifying multiple face attributes.

TI  - Multiple Attention Mechanism Graph Convolution HAR Model Based on Coordination
      Theory.
LID - 5259 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/s22145259 [doi]
AB  - Human action recognition (HAR) is the foundation of human behavior comprehension.
      It is of great significance and can be used in many real-world applications. From
      the point of view of human kinematics, the coordination of limbs is an important 
      intrinsic factor of motion and contains a great deal of information. In addition,
      for different movements, the HAR algorithm provides important, multifaceted
      attention to each joint. Based on the above analysis, this paper proposes a HAR
      algorithm, which adopts two attention modules that work together to extract the
      coordination characteristics in the process of motion, and strengthens the
      attention of the model to the more important joints in the process of moving.
      Experimental data shows these two modules can improve the recognition accuracy of
      the model on the public HAR dataset (NTU-RGB + D, Kinetics-Skeleton).

TI  - ECG Approximate Entropy in the Elderly during Cycling Exercise.
LID - 5255 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/s22145255 [doi]
AB  - Approximate entropy (ApEn) is used as a nonlinear measure of heart-rate
      variability (HRV) in the analysis of ECG time-series recordings. Previous studies
      have reported that HRV can differentiate between frail and pre-frail people. In
      this study, EEGs and ECGs were recorded from 38 elderly adults while performing a
      three-stage cycling routine. Before and after cycling stages, 5-min resting-state
      EEGs (rs-EEGs) and ECGs were also recorded under the eyes-open condition.
      Applying the K-mean classifier to pre-exercise rs-ECG ApEn values and body
      weights revealed nine females with EEG power which was far higher than that of
      the other subjects in all cycling stages. The breathing of those females was more
      rapid than that of other subjects and their average heart rate was faster. Those 
      females also presented higher degrees of asymmetry in the alpha and theta bands
      (stronger power levels in the right frontal electrode), indicating stressful
      responses during the experiment. It appears that EEG delta activity could be used
      in conjunction with a very low ECG frequency power as a predictor of bursts in
      the heart rate to facilitate the monitoring of elderly adults at risk of heart
      failure. A resting ECG ApEn index in conjunction with the subject's weight or BMI

TI  - EEG Emotion Classification Network Based on Attention Fusion of Multi-Channel
      Band Features.
LID - 5252 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/s22145252 [doi]
AB  - Understanding learners' emotions can help optimize instruction sand further
      conduct effective learning interventions. Most existing studies on student
      emotion recognition are based on multiple manifestations of external behavior,
      which do not fully use physiological signals. In this context, on the one hand, a
      learning emotion EEG dataset (LE-EEG) is constructed, which captures
      physiological signals reflecting the emotions of boredom, neutrality, and
      engagement during learning; on the other hand, an EEG emotion classification
      network based on attention fusion (ECN-AF) is proposed. To be specific, on the
      basis of key frequency bands and channels selection, multi-channel band features 
      are first extracted (using a multi-channel backbone network) and then fused
      (using attention units). In order to verify the performance, the proposed model
      is tested on an open-access dataset SEED (N = 15) and the self-collected dataset 
      LE-EEG (N = 45), respectively. The experimental results using five-fold cross
      validation show the following: (i) on the SEED dataset, the highest accuracy of
      96.45% is achieved by the proposed model, demonstrating a slight increase of
      1.37% compared to the baseline models; and (ii) on the LE-EEG dataset, the
      highest accuracy of 95.87% is achieved, demonstrating a 21.49% increase compared 
      to the baseline models.

TI  - Non-Deep Active Learning for Deep Neural Networks.
LID - 5244 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/s22145244 [doi]
AB  - One way to improve annotation efficiency is active learning. The goal of active
      learning is to select images from many unlabeled images, where labeling will
      improve the accuracy of the machine learning model the most. To select the most
      informative unlabeled images, conventional methods use deep neural networks with 
      a large number of computation nodes and long computation time, but we propose a
      non-deep neural network method that does not require any additional training for 
      unlabeled image selection. The proposed method trains a task model on labeled
      images, and then the model predicts unlabeled images. Based on this prediction,
      an uncertainty indicator is generated for each unlabeled image. Images with a
      high uncertainty index are considered to have a high information content, and are
      selected for annotation. Our proposed method is based on a very simple and
      powerful idea: select samples near the decision boundary of the model.
      Experimental results on multiple datasets show that the proposed method achieves 
      higher accuracy than conventional active learning methods on multiple tasks and
      up to 14 times faster execution time from 1.2&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;106 s to
      8.3&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;104 s. The proposed method outperforms the current SoTA
      method by 1% accuracy on CIFAR-10.

TI  - Enhanced Angle-of-Arrival and Polarization Parameter Estimation Using Localized
      Hybrid Dual-Polarized Arrays.
LID - 5207 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/s22145207 [doi]
AB  - The millimeter wave (mmWave) channel is dominated by line-of-sight propagation.
      Therefore, the acquisition of angle-of-arrival (AoA) and polarization state of
      the wave is of great significance to the receiver. In this paper, we investigate 
      AoA and polarization estimation in a mmWave system employing dual-polarized
      antenna arrays. We propose an enhanced AoA estimation method using a localized
      hybrid dual-polarized array for a polarized mmWave signal. The use of
      dual-polarized arrays greatly improves the calibration of differential signals
      and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the phase offset estimation between
      adjacent subarrays. Given the estimated phase offset, an initial AoA estimate can
      be obtained, and is then used to update the phase offset estimation. This leads
      to a recursive estimation with improved accuracy. We further propose an enhanced 
      polarization estimation method, which uses the power of total received signals at
      dual-polarized antennas to compute the cross-correlation-to-power ratio instead
      of using only one axis dipole. Thus the accuracy of polarization parameter
      estimation is improved. We also derive a closed-form expression for mean square
      error lower bounds of AoA estimation and present an average SNR analysis for
      polarization estimation performance. Simulation results demonstrate the
      superiority of the enhanced AoA and polarization parameter estimation methods
      compared to the state of the art.

TI  - Assessment of ZTD Derived from COSMIC Occultation Data with ECWMF, Radiosondes,
      and GNSS.
LID - 5209 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/s22145209 [doi]
AB  - Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals generate slant tropospheric
      delays when they pass through the atmosphere, which is recognized as the main
      source of error in many spatial geodetic applications. The zenith tropospheric
      delay (ZTD) derived from radio occultation data is of great significance to
      atmospheric research and meteorology and needs to be assessed in the use of
      precision positioning. Based on the atmPrf, sonPrf, and echPrf data from the
      Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC) 
      Data Analysis and Archiving Center (CDAAC) from 1 January to 31 December 2008 and
      2012, we obtained the ZTDs of the radio occultation data (occZTD) and the
      corresponding radiosonde (sonZTD) and ECWMF data (echZTD). The ZTDs derived from 
      ground-based global positioning system (GPS) observations from the International 
      GNSS Service (IGS) were corrected to the lowest tangent point height of the
      matched radio occultation profile by the barometric height formula (gnsZTD). The 
      statistical results show that the absolute values of the bias between occZTD and 
      echZTD, sonZTD, or gnsZTD are less than 5 mm, and the standard deviations are
      approximately 20 mm or less, indicating that occZTD had significant accuracy in
      the GNSS positioning model even when the local spherical symmetry assumption
      error was introduced when the Abel inversion algorithm was used to obtain the
      refractive index profile of atmPrf. The effects of the horizontal/vertical
      matching resolution and the variation in the station height/latitude on the
      biases of occZTD and gnsZTD were analyzed. The results can be used to quantify
      the performance of radio occultation data for tropospheric delay error correction
      in dynamic high-precision positioning.

TI  - An Oversampling Method of Unbalanced Data for Mechanical Fault Diagnosis Based on
      MeanRadius-SMOTE.
LID - 5166 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/s22145166 [doi]
AB  - With the development of machine learning, data-driven mechanical fault diagnosis 
      methods have been widely used in the field of PHM. Due to the limitation of the
      amount of fault data, it is a difficult problem for fault diagnosis to solve the 
      problem of unbalanced data sets. Under unbalanced data sets, faults with little
      historical data are always difficult to diagnose and lead to economic losses. In 
      order to improve the prediction accuracy under unbalanced data sets, this paper
      proposes MeanRadius-SMOTE based on the traditional SMOTE oversampling algorithm, 
      which effectively avoids the generation of useless samples and noise samples.
      This paper validates the effectiveness of the algorithm on three linear
      unbalanced data sets and four step unbalanced data sets. Experimental results
      show that MeanRadius-SMOTE outperforms SMOTE and LR-SMOTE in various evaluation
      indicators, as well as has better robustness against different imbalance rates.
      In addition, MeanRadius-SMOTE can take into account the prediction accuracy of
      the overall and minority class, which is of great significance for engineering
      applications.

AB  - Temperature is a significant factor in determining and characterizing cellular
      metabolism and other biochemical activities. In this study, we provide a brief
      overview of two important technologies used to monitor the local temperatures of 
      individual living cells: fluorescence nano-thermometry and an array of
      micro-/nano-sized thin-film thermocouples. We explain some key technical issues
      that must be addressed and optimised for further practical applications, such as 
      in cell biology, drug selection, and novel antitumor therapy. We also offer a
      method for combining them into a hybrid measuring system.

TI  - The Progress of Research into Flexible Sensors in the Field of Smart Wearables.
LID - 5089 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/s22145089 [doi]
AB  - In modern society, technology associated with smart sensors made from flexible
      materials is rapidly evolving. As a core component in the field of wearable smart
      devices (or 'smart wearables'), flexible sensors have the advantages of excellent
      flexibility, ductility, free folding properties, and more. When choosing
      materials for the development of sensors, reduced weight, elasticity, and
      wearer's convenience are considered as advantages, and are suitable for
      electronic skin, monitoring of health-related issues, biomedicine, human-computer
      interactions, and other fields of biotechnology. The idea behind wearable sensory
      devices is to enable their easy integration into everyday life. This review
      discusses the concepts of sensory mechanism, detected object, and contact form of
      flexible sensors, and expounds the preparation materials and their applicability.
      This is with the purpose of providing a reference for the further development of 
      flexible sensors suitable for wearable devices.

TI  - Development of a Custom-Made 3D Printing Protocol with Commercial Resins for
      Manufacturing Microfluidic Devices.
LID - 2955 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/polym14142955 [doi]
AB  - The combination of microfluidics and photo-polymerization techniques such as
      stereolithography (SLA) has emerged as a new field which has a lot of potential
      to influence in such important areas as biological analysis, and chemical
      detection among others. However, the integration between them is still at an
      early stage of development. In this article, after analyzing the resolution of a 
      custom SLA 3D printer with commercial resins, microfluidic devices were
      manufactured using three different approaches. First, printing a mold with the
      objective of creating a Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) replica with the microfluidic
      channels; secondly, open channels have been printed and then assembled with a
      flat cover of the same resin material. Finally, a closed microfluidic device has 
      also been produced in a single process of printing. Important results for 3D
      printing with commercial resins have been achieved by only printing one layer on 
      top of the channel. All microfluidic devices have been tested successfully for
      pressure-driven fluid flow.

TI  - Progressive Damage Behaviour Analysis and Comparison with 2D/3D Hashin Failure
      Models on Carbon Fibre-Reinforced Aluminium Laminates.
LID - 2946 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/polym14142946 [doi]
AB  - It is known that carbon fibre-reinforced aluminium laminate is the third
      generation of fibre metal materials. This study investigates the response of
      carbon fibre-reinforced aluminium laminates (CARALL) under tensile loading and
      three-point bending tests, which evaluate the damage initiation and propagation
      mechanism. The 2D Hashin and 3D Hashin VUMAT models are used to analyse and
      compare each composite layer for finite element modelling. A bilinear cohesive
      contact model is modelled for the interface failure, and the Johnson cook model
      describes the aluminium layer. The mechanical response and failure analysis of
      CARALL were evaluated using load versus deflection curves, and the scanning
      electron microscope was adopted. The results revealed that the failure modes of
      CARALL were mainly observed in the aluminium layer fracture, fibre pull-out,
      fracture, and matrix tensile fracture under tensile and flexural loading
      conditions. The 2D Hashin and 3D Hashin models were similar in predicting tensile
      properties, flexural properties, mechanical response before peak load points, and
      final failure modes. It is highlighted that the 3D Hashin model can accurately
      reveal the failure mechanism and failure propagation mechanism of CARALL.

LID - 10.3390/polym14142942 [doi]
AB  - This study aims to increase the specific surface area of multi-walled carbon
      nanotubes (MWCNTs) by forming and subsequently removing various metal oxide
      nanoparticles on them. We used facile methods, such as forming the particles
      without using a vacuum or gas and removing these particles through simple acid
      treatment. The shapes of the composite structures on which the metal oxide
      particles were formed and the formation of multi-vacancy-defect MWCNTs were
      confirmed via transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. 
      The crystallinity of the formed metal oxide particles was confirmed using X-ray
      diffraction analysis. Through specific surface area analysis and Raman
      spectroscopy, the number of defects formed and the degree and tendency of
      defect-formation in each metal were determined. In all the cases where the metal 
      oxide particles were removed, the specific surface area increased, and the metal 
      inducing the highest specific surface area was determined.

TI  - Valorization of Ferulic Acid from Agro-Industrial by-Products for Application in 
      Agriculture.
LID - 2874 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/polym14142874 [doi]
AB  - The use of bioplastic mulch in agriculture has increased dramatically in the last
      years throughout the world. Nowadays, biodegradable materials for mulching films 
      strive to constitute a reliable and more sustainable alternative to classical
      materials such as polyethylene (PE). The main challenge is to improve their
      durability in the soil to meet the required service length for crop farming by
      using benign and sustainable antioxidant systems. Here, we report the design and 
      fabrication of biodegradable materials based on polybutylene (succinate adipate) 
      (PBSA) for mulching applications, incorporating a fully biobased polymeric
      antioxidant deriving from ferulic acid, which can be extracted from an industrial
      by-product. Poly-dihydro (ethylene ferulate) (PHEF) from ferulic acid was
      synthesized by a two-step polymerization process. It is characterized by improved
      thermal stability in comparison with ferulic acid monomer and therefore suitable 
      for common industrial processing conditions. Different blends of PBSA and PHEF
      obtained by melt mixing or by reactive extrusion were prepared and analyzed to
      understand the effect of the presence of PHEF. The results demonstrate that PHEF,
      when processed by reactive extrusion, presents a remarkable antioxidant effect,
      even in comparison with commercial additives, preserving a high level of the
      mechanical properties of the PBSA matrix without affecting the biodegradable
      character of the blend.

LID - 10.3390/polym14142871 [doi]
AB  - A novel piezoelectric generator based on soft piezoelectric film consisting of a 
      polyimide (PI) sheet and lead zirconate titanate (PZT) is proposed to generate
      electric energy under the operating conditions of low-frequency and
      small-amplitude vibration. The theoretical model and working principle of the
      piezoelectric generator are discussed in detail. Using ANSYS software, a finite
      element analysis of the static and modal characteristics of the piezoelectric
      generator is carried out. Further, the output of the prepared piezoelectric
      generator is investigated by a home-made experimental platform. Results show that
      the transient excitation voltage of the generator increases with the increase in 
      load resistance, and the continuous excitation voltage increases first and then
      remains almost stable. The maximum continuous power produced by the piezoelectric
      generator is about 4.82 mW. Furthermore, the continuous excitation voltage and
      power are in accordance with the simulation values when the load resistances are 
      20 kOmega and 25 kOmega, respectively.

TI  - Comparative Study on the Spreading Behavior of Oil Droplets over Teflon
      Substrates in Different Media Environments.
LID - 2828 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/polym14142828 [doi]
AB  - This paper comparatively investigated the spreading process of an oil droplet on 
      the surface of highly hydrophobic solid (Teflon) in air and water media using a
      high-speed imaging technology, and analyzed their differences in spreading
      behavior from the perspective of empirical relations and energy conservation.
      Furthermore, the classical HD and MKT wetting models were applied to describe the
      oil droplet spreading dynamics to reveal the spreading mechanism of oil droplets 
      on the Teflon in different media environments. Results showed that the entire
      spreading process of oil droplets on Teflon in air could be separated into three 
      stages: the early linear fast spreading stage following theta(t)=theta0+kt , the 
      intermediate exponential slow spreading stage obeying theta(t)=bt-3alpha, and the
      late spreading stage described by theta(t)=thetaeq+axexp(-t/T). However, the
      dynamics behavior of dynamic contact angle during the oil droplet spreading on
      Teflon in water could be well described by these expressions, theta(t)=theta0+kt 
      and theta(t)=thetaeq+axexp(-t/T). Clearly, a significant difference in the oil
      droplet spreading behavior in air and water media was found, and the absence of
      the intermediate exponential spreading stage in the oil-water-Teflon system could
      be attributed to the difference in the dissipated energy of the system because
      the dissipation energy in the oil-water-solid system included not only the
      viscous dissipation energy of the boundary layer of oil droplet, but also that of
      the surrounding water which was not included in the dissipation energy of the
      oil-air-solid system. Moreover, the quantitative analysis of wetting models
      suggested that the MKT model could reasonably describe the late spreading
      dynamics of oil droplets (low TPCL velocities), while the HD model may be more
      suitable for describing the oil droplet spreading dynamics at the early and
      intermediate spreading stages (high TPCL velocities).

TI  - Organic-Inorganic Double-Gel System Thermally Insulating and Hydrophobic
      Polyimide Aerogel.
LID - 2818 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/polym14142818 [doi]
AB  - Aerogel materials are used in various fields, but there is a shortage of aerogel 
      materials with an excellent combination of mechanical properties, thermal
      stability, and easy preparation. In this study, polyimide aerogel materials with 
      superior mechanical properties, thermal stability, and low thermal conductivity
      were prepared by forming a double-gel system in the liquid phase. The
      amino-modified gel, prepared by coating SiO2 nano-microspheres with GO through a 
      modified sol-gel method (SiO2@GO-NH2), was subsequently homogeneously dispersed
      with PAA wet gel in water to form a double-gel system. The construction of a
      double-gel system enabled the PI aerogel to shape a unique honeycomb porous
      structure and a multi-layered interface of PI/SiO2/GO. The final obtained PI
      aerogel possessed effective thermal conductivity (0.0309 W/m.K) and a high
      specific modulus (46.19 m(2)/s(2)). In addition, the high thermal stability
      (543.80 degrees C in Ar atmosphere) and the ability to retain properties under
      heat treatment proved its durability in high thermal environments. The
      hydrophobicity (131.55 degrees ) proves its resistance to water from the
      environment. The excellent performance of this PI aerogel and its durability in
      thermal working environments make it possible to be applied in varied industrial 
      and research fields, such as construction and energy, where heat and thermal
      insulation are required.

LID - 2779 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/polym14142779 [doi]
AB  - The transformation of lignin with natural aromatic structure into value-added
      carbon dots (CDs) achieves a win-win situation for low-cost production of novel
      nanomaterials and reasonable disposal of biomass waste. However, it remains
      challenging to produce multi-emission CDs from biomass for advanced applications.
      Herein, a green and facile approach to preparing multi-emission CDs from alkali
      lignin via N and B co-doping is developed. The obtained N and B co-doped CDs
      (NB-CDs) show multi-emission fluorescence centers at 346, 428 and 514 nm under
      different excitations. As the doping amount of N and B increases, the
      fluorescence emission band gradually shifts to 428 and 514 nm, while that at 346 
      nm decreases. The fluorescence mechanism is explored through the research of the 
      structure, composition and optical performance of NB-CDs in combination with
      density functional theory (DFT) calculations. It demonstrates that the effect of 
      doping with B-containing functional groups on the fluorescence emission behavior 
      is multivariate, which may be the crucial contribution to the unique
      multi-emission fluorescence of CDs. The multi-emission NB-CDs with prominent
      stability are applied for multilevel anti-counterfeiting printing. It provides a 
      promising direction for the sustainable and advanced application of
      biomass-derived CDs, and the theoretical results highlight a new insight into the
      deep understanding of the multi-emission fluorescence mechanism.

AB  - Chrysin is a natural bioactive molecule with various groups, and it has been a

      effect. In this paper, molecularly imprinted polymers (Bi-MIPs) were prepared
      using methacrylic acid and acrylamide as binary functional monomers for the
      separation and enrichment of chrysin. The Bi-MIPs were characterized using
      thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR)
      and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The performances of Bi-MIPs were
      assessed, which included adsorption isotherms, selective recognition and
      adsorption kinetics. The experimental results show that Bi-MIPs are shaped as a
      uniform sphere with an abundant pocket structure on its surface. The adsorption
      of chrysin on the Bi-MIPs followed a pseudo-second-order and adapted
      Langmuir-Freundlich isotherm models. The adsorption performance of the Bi-MIPs
      was determined at different temperatures, and the Bi-MIPs showed excellent
      adsorption performance at 30 degrees C. The initial decomposition temperature of 
      the Bi-MIPs was 220 degrees C. After five times of adsorption and desorption, the
      adsorption performance of the Bi-MIPs decreased by only 7%. In contrast with
      single functional monomer molecularly imprinted polymers (Si-MIPs), the Bi-MIPs
      showed excellent specificity, with an imprinting factor of 1.54. The Bi-MIPs are 
      promising materials in the separation and enrichment of chrysin for their high
      adsorption capacity, low cost and being environmentally friendly.

TI  - Heterologous Expression of Three Transcription Factors Differently Regulated
      Astragalosides Metabolic Biosynthesis in Astragalus membranaceus Hairy Roots.
LID - 1897 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/plants11141897 [doi]
AB  - Astragalus membranaceus has been used as a highly popular Chinese herbal medicine
      for centuries. Triterpenoids, namely astragalosides I, II, III, and IV, represent
      the main active compounds in this plant species. Transcription factors have a
      powerful effect on metabolite biosynthesis in plants. We investigated the effect 
      of the Arabidopsis MYB12, production of anthocyanin pigment 1 (PAP1), and maize
      leaf color (LC) transcription factors in regulating the synthesis of
      astragaloside metabolites in A. membranaceus. Overexpression of these
      transcription factors in hairy roots differentially up-regulated these active
      compounds. Specifically, the overexpression of LC resulted in the accumulation of
      astragalosides I-IV. The content of astragalosides I and IV were, in particular, 
      more highly accumulated. Overexpression of MYB12 increased the accumulation of
      astragaloside I in transgenic hairy roots, followed by astragaloside IV, and
      overexpression of PAP1 resulted in the increased synthesis of astragalosides I
      and IV. In addition, we found that overexpression of PAP1 together with LC
      increased astragaloside III levels. At the transcriptional level, several key
      genes of the mevalonate biosynthetic pathway, especially HMGR1, HMGR2, and HMGR3,
      were up-regulated differentially in response to these transcription factors,
      resulting in astragaloside synthesis in the hairy roots of A. membranaceus.
      Overall, our results indicated that heterologous expression of Arabidopsis MYB12,
      PAP1, and maize LC differentially affected triterpenoids biosynthesis, leading to
      the increased biosynthesis of active compounds in A. membranaceus.

TI  - A Rapid Method for Detecting Normal or Modified Plant and Algal Carbonic
      Anhydrase Activity Using Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
LID - 1882 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/plants11141882 [doi]
AB  - In recent years, researchers have attempted to improve photosynthesis by
      introducing components from cyanobacterial and algal CO2-concentrating mechanisms
      (CCMs) into terrestrial C3 plants. For these attempts to succeed, we need to
      understand the CCM components in more detail, especially carbonic anhydrase (CA) 
      and bicarbonate (HCO3(-)) transporters. Heterologous complementation systems
      capable of detecting carbonic anhydrase activity (i.e., catalysis of the
      pH-dependent interconversion between CO2 and HCO3(-)) or active HCO3(-) transport
      can be of great value in the process of introducing CCM components into
      terrestrial C3 plants. In this study, we generated a Saccharomyces cerevisiae CA 
      knock-out (DeltaNCE103 or DeltaCA) that has a high-CO2-dependent phenotype (5%
      (v/v) CO2 in air). CAs produce HCO3(-) for anaplerotic pathways in S. cerevisiae;
      therefore, the unavailability of HCO3(-) for neutral lipid biosynthesis is a
      limitation for the growth of DeltaCA in ambient levels of CO2 (0.04% (v/v) CO2 in
      air). &amp;nbsp;DeltaCA can be complemented for growth at ambient levels of CO2
      by expressing a CA from human red blood cells. DeltaCA was also successfully
      complemented for growth at ambient levels of CO2 through the expression of CAs
      from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Arabidopsis thaliana. The DeltaCA strain is
      also useful for investigating the activity of modified CAs, allowing for quick
      screening of modified CAs before putting them into the plants. CA activity in the
      complemented DeltaCA strains can be probed using the Wilbur-Anderson assay and by
      isotope exchange membrane-inlet mass spectrometry (MIMS). Other potential uses
      for this new DeltaCA-based screening system are also discussed.

TI  - Morphological and Physiological Indicators for Screening Cell Lines with High
      Potential for Somatic Embryo Maturation at an Early Stage of Somatic
      Embryogenesis in Pinus Koraiensis.
LID - 1867 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/plants11141867 [doi]
AB  - Many cell lines in the embryogenic callus cannot produce somatic embryos (SEs)
      even if they meet the optimal SE maturation culture conditions during conifer
      somatic embryogenesis. This phenomenon hinders the progress of the
      industrial-scale reproduction of conifers. Therefore, there is an urgent need to 
      obtain morphological and physiological markers to screen embryogenic calli in
      response to SE maturation conditions. To detect cell lines with high somatic
      embryogenesis potential during the proliferation process, we counted the number
      of pro-embryos and early SEs (ESEs) in different cell lines and storage
      substances, endogenous hormones, and polyamine contents. The results showed that 
      the yield of P. koraiensis SEs was heavily dependent on genotype (p = 0.001).
      There were high levels of PE III (pro-embryo III) number, ESE number, and soluble
      protein content, in the response cell lines (R cell lines), which were 1.6-, 3-, 
      and 1.1-fold those of the obstructive cell lines (B cell lines), respectively.
      The B cell line had high levels of starch, auxin (IAA), Put, Spd, and putrescine:
      spermine (Put: Spm) compared to the R cell line. In addition, the numbers of PE
      III, ESEs, and soluble protein content were significantly positively correlated
      with SE yield. In contrast, the contents of starch, abscisic acid (ABA), Put,
      Spm, and Spd were significantly negatively correlated with SE yield. To ensure
      the accuracy of the results, we used nine cell lines to test the results. The PE 
      III and ESE numbers and the Spm and Spd contents were positively correlated with 
      SE yield, while the levels of starch, ABA, IAA, Put: Spd, and Put: Spm were
      negatively correlated with SE yield. Thus, we recommend using high PE III and
      ESEs as morphological indicators and low levels of starch, IAA, ABA, and Put: Spm
      as physiological markers to screen cell lines with a high somatic embryogenesis
      potential. In addition, we also found that the relationship between Spd, Spm, and
      SE yield was opposite in the two experimental results. Therefore, we speculate
      that the differences in Spd and Spm content are mainly affected by genotype. In
      conclusion, this study obtained the morphological and physiological markers of
      some high-somatic embryogenic cell lines by comparing the differences between
      nine somatic embryogenic cell lines. Our results can guide the improvement of
      conifer somatic embryogenesis technology and can provide a theoretical basis for 
      accelerating the application of biotechnology in large-scale artificial breeding.

      exhibited the highest composition, constituting 88-91% of the total average
      content. Moreover, the average hexacosanol (6) contents showed remarkable
      variations of 337.8 (5 days) --> 416.8 (7 days) --> 458.9 (9 days) --> 490.0 (11 
      days) --> 479.2 (13 days) --> 427.0 mg/100 g (15 days). The seedlings collected
      at 11 days showed the highest average policosanol content (541.7 mg/100 g), with 
      the lowest content being 383.4 mg/100 g after 5 days. Interestingly, policosanols
      from oat seedlings grown for 11 days induced the most prevalent phenotype of AMPK
      activation in HepG2 cells, indicating that policosanols are an excellent AMPK
      activator.

TI  - Authentication of Hippophae rhamnoides ssp. sinensis and ssp. mongolica Based on 
      Single Nucleotide Polymorphism at Ribosomal DNA and Their Vitamin Content
      Analysis.
LID - 1843 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/plants11141843 [doi]
AB  - Hippophae rhamnoides widely known as sea buckthorn berries (SB) are rich in
      vitamins and phytonutrients. The subspecies ssp. sinensis and ssp. mongolica are 
      highly valued for their medicinal properties and vitamin contents, hence
      domesticated widely across Eurasia and Southeast Asia. Due to the frequent usage 
      of these two subspecies, accurate identification is required to prevent
      economically motivated adulteration. In this study, we report the single
      nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) based molecular markers to easily distinguish these
      two subspecies at 45S nrDNA region. From the determined 45S rDNA region, we
      designed two primers (5' sinensis and 5' mongolica) and developed a multiplex PCR
      profile. The developed primers effectively distinguished the sea buckthorn
      subspecies in commercial products as well. Along with the development of
      subspecies specific primers, we have profiled vitamin contents from H. rhamnoides
      ssp. sinensis and ssp. mongolica and found ascorbic acid and riboflavin contents 
      were high in both ssp. sinensis and spp. mongolica, yet the content of folic acid
      was high only in ssp. mongolica. Thus, we provide species specific primers and
      vitamin profile as an effective authentication of H. rhamnoides.

AB  - Several activities in the agriculture sector lead to the accumulation of Nickel
      (Ni) in soil. Therefore, effective and economical ways to reduce soil
      bioavailability of Ni must be identified. Five isolates of Rhizobium
      leguminosarum biovar Viceae (ICARDA 441, ICARDA 36, ICARDA 39, TAL-1148, and
      ARC-207) and three bacterial strains (Bacillus subtilis, B. circulance, and B.
      coagulans) were evaluated for tolerance and biosorption of different levels of Ni
      (0, 20, 40, 60, and 80 mg L(-1)). Pot experiments were conducted during the
      2019/2020 and 2020/2021 seasons using four inoculation treatments (inoculation
      with the most tolerant Rhizobium (TAL-1148), inoculation with the most tolerant
      Rhizobium (TAL-1148) + B. subtilis, inoculation with the most tolerant Rhizobium 
      (TAL-1148) + B.&amp;nbsp;circulance, and inoculation with the most tolerant
      Rhizobium (TAL-1148) + B.&amp;nbsp;coagulans) under different levels of Ni (0,
      200, 400, and 600 mg kg(-1)), and their effects on growth, physiological
      characteristics, antioxidant enzymes, and Ni accumulation in faba bean plants
      (Vicia faba C.V. Nobaria 1) were determined. The results showed that Rhizobium
      (TAL-1148) and B. subtilis were the most tolerant of Ni. In pot trials,
      inoculation with the most tolerant Rhizobium TAL-1148 + B. subtilis treatment was
      shown to be more effective in terms of growth parameters (dry weight of plant,
      plant height, number of nodules, and N2 content), and this was reflected in
      physiological characteristics and antioxidant enzymes under 600 mg kg(-1) Ni
      compared to the other treatments in the 2019/2020 season. In the second season,
      2020/2021, a similar pattern was observed. Additionally, lower concentrations of 
      Ni were found in faba bean plants (roots and shoots). Therefore, a combination of
      the most tolerant Rhizobium (TAL-1148) + B. subtilis treatment might be used to
      reduce Ni toxicity.

LID - 10.3390/plants11141793 [doi]
AB  - The chemical composition of essential oils (EOs) from ten Peruvian Piper species 
      (Piper coruscans, Pc; P. tuberculatum, Pt; P. casapiense, Pcs; P. obliquum, Po;
      P. dumosum, Pd; P. anonifolium, Pa; P. reticulatum, Pr; P. soledadense, Ps; P.
      sancti-felicis, Psf and P. mituense, Pm) has been studied, along with their
      antifungal and phytotoxic activities. These EOs contained
      beta-bisabolene/nerolidol (Pc), beta-bisabolene/delta-cadinene/caryophyllene
      (Pt), caryophyllene oxide (Pcs), bicyclogermacrene/10-epi-Elemol (Po),
      bicyclogermacrene/germacrene-D/apiol (Pd), caryophyllene/germacrene-D (Pa),
      germacrene-D (Pr), limonene/apiol (Ps), apiol (Psf), and apiol/bicyclogermacrene 
      (Pm) as major components, and some are described here for the first time (Ps,
      Pcs, Pm). A composition-based dendrogram of these Piper species showed four major
      groups (G1: Pc and Pt, G2: Pcs, Po, Pd, Pa, and Pr, G3: Ps, and G4: Psf and Pm). 
      The spore germination effects (Aspergillus niger, Botrytis cinerea, and
      Alternaria alternate) and phytotoxicity (Lolium perenne and Lactuca sativa) of
      these EOs were studied. Most of these Piper essential oils showed important
      activity against phytopathogenic fungi (except G1), especially against B.
      cinerea. Similarly, most of the essential oils were phytotoxic against L. perenne
      (except G1), with P. sancti-felicis (G4), P. casapiense (G2), and P. reticulatum 
      (G2) being the most effective. Caryophyllene oxide, beta-caryophyllene,
      beta-pinene, limonene, alpha-humulene, and apiol were evaluated against B.
      cinerea,&amp;nbsp;with the most effective compounds being beta-pinene, apiol, and
      limonene. This work demonstrates the species-dependent potential of essential
      oils from Peruvian Piper species as fungicidal and herbicidal agents.

LID - 1522 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics14071522 [doi]
AB  - The conventional cancer therapeutic modalities include surgery, chemotherapy and 
      radiotherapy. Although immunotherapy and targeted therapy are also widely used in
      cancer treatment, chemotherapy remains the cornerstone of tumor treatment. With
      the rapid development of nanotechnology, nanomedicine is believed to be an
      emerging field to further improve the efficacy of chemotherapy. Until now, there 
      are more than 17 kinds of nanomedicine for cancer therapy approved globally.
      Thereinto, conjugated nanomedicine, as an important type of nanomedicine, can not
      only possess the targeted delivery of chemotherapeutics with great precision but 
      also achieve controlled drug release to avoid adverse effects. Meanwhile,
      conjugated nanomedicine provides the platform for combining several different
      therapeutic approaches (chemotherapy, photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy,
      thermodynamic therapy, immunotherapy, etc.) with the purpose of achieving
      synergistic effects during cancer treatment. Therefore, this review focuses on
      conjugated nanomedicine and its various applications in synergistic chemotherapy.
      Additionally, the further perspectives and challenges of the conjugated
      nanomedicine are also addressed, which clarifies the design direction of a new
      generation of conjugated nanomedicine and facilitates the translation of them
      from the bench to the bedside.

TI  - Design Space Approach for the Optimization of Green Fluidized Bed Granulation
      Process in the Granulation of a Poorly Water-Soluble Fenofibrate Using Design of 
      Experiment.
LID - 1471 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics14071471 [doi]
AB  - In the pharmaceutical industry, the systematic optimization of process variables 
      using a quality-by-design (QbD) approach is highly precise, economic and ensures 
      product quality. The current research presents the implementation of a
      design-of-experiment (DoE) driven QbD approach for the optimization of key
      process variables of the green fluidized bed granulation (GFBG) process. A 3(2)
      full-factorial design was performed to explore the effect of water amount (X1;
      1-6% w/w) and spray rate (X2; 2-8 g/min) as key process variables on critical
      quality attributes (CQAs) of granules and tablets. Regression analysis have
      demonstrated that changing the levels of X1 and X2 significantly affect (p </=
      0.05) the CQAs of granules and tablets. Particularly, X1 was found to have the
      pronounced effect on the CQAs. The GFBG process was optimized, and a design space
      (DS) was built using numerical optimization. It was found that X1 and X2 at high 
      (5.69% w/w) and low (2 g/min) levels, respectively, demonstrated the optimum
      operating conditions. By optimizing X1 and X2, GFBG could enhance the
      disintegration and dissolution of tablets containing a poorly water-soluble drug.
      The prediction error values of dependent responses were less than 5% that confirm
      validity, robustness and accuracy of the generated DS in optimization of GFBG.

TI  - Simultaneous LC-ESI-MS/MS Quantification of Levosimendan and Its Metabolites for 
      Therapeutic Drug Monitoring of Cardiac Surgery Patients.
LID - 1454 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics14071454 [doi]
AB  - Levosimendan is used in severe chronic cardiac insufficiency, also within the
      peri-operative setting. Real-life pharmacokinetic data in surgical patients is
      lacking, making therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of levosimendan, its
      pharmacologically active metabolite OR-1896, and its intermediate OR-1855
      important. A simultaneous highly sensitive quantification of levosimendan and its
      metabolites in small-volume samples has not yet been described. Here,
      levosimendan (LLOQ 0.450 nM), OR-1896, and OR-1855 (LLOQ both 1.0 nM) were
      successfully quantified by LC-ESI-MS/MS after liquid-liquid extraction in 300
      microL of blood. A short C8 column under reversed-phase conditions enabled
      simultaneous and fast quantification of levosimendan in the negative and the
      metabolites in the positive ionization mode in a single run within 2 min.
      Interestingly and unexpectedly, constitutional isomers of levosimendan
      metabolites with identical mass transitions and similar retention times were
      observed in surgical patients' samples, which we identified as the metamizole
      metabolites 4-aminoantipyrine and 4-acetamidoantipyrine. A longer C8 column and a
      modified mobile phase enabled selective quantification of all analytes in a
      single run within 7 min. We developed, validated, and applied highly sensitive
      LC-ESI-MS/MS methods for simultaneous quantification of levosimendan and its
      metabolites, enabling efficient TDM of cardiac surgery patients even with
      additional metamizole administration.

TI  - Trans-Anethole Alleviates Trimethyltin Chloride-Induced Impairments in Long-Term 
      Potentiation.
LID - 1422 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics14071422 [doi]
AB  - Trans-anethole is an aromatic compound that has been studied for its
      anti-inflammation, anticonvulsant, antinociceptive, and anticancer effects. A
      recent report found that trans-anethole exerted neuroprotective effects on the
      brain via multiple pathways. Since noxious stimuli may both induce neuronal cell 
      injury and affect synaptic functions (e.g., synaptic transmission or plasticity),
      it is important to understand whether the neuroprotective effect of
      trans-anethole extends to synaptic plasticity. Here, the effects of trimethyltin 
      (TMT), which is a neurotoxic organotin compound, was investigated using the field
      recording method on hippocampal slice of mice. The influence of trans-anethole on
      long-term potentiation (LTP) was also studied for both NMDA receptor-dependent
      and NMDA receptor-independent cases. The action of trans-anethole on TMT-induced 
      LTP impairment was examined, too. These results revealed that trans-anethole
      enhances NMDA receptor-dependent and -independent LTP and alleviates TMT-induced 
      LTP impairment. These results suggest that trans-anethole modulates hippocampal
      LTP induction, prompting us to speculate that it may be helpful for improving
      cognitive impairment arising from neurodegenerative diseases, including
      Alzheimer's disease.

TI  - Scope and Limitations of Current Antibiotic Therapies against Helicobacter
      pylori: Reviewing Amoxicillin Gastroretentive Formulations.
LID - 1340 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics14071340 [doi]
AB  - Even though general improvement of quality of life has happened around the globe,
      statistics show that gastric cancer is still a very serious medical concern in
      some regions of the world. A big portion of malignant neoplasms that develop
      inside the stomach are linked to an infection of Helicobacter pylori; in fact,
      this pathogen has already been categorized as a group 1 carcinogen by the World
      Health Organization (WHO). Still, the efficacy of current anti-H. pylori
      therapeutic approaches is insufficient and follows a worrying decreasing trend,
      mainly due to an exponential increase in resistance to key antibiotics. This work
      analyzes the clinical and biological characteristics of this pathogen, especially
      its link to gastric cancer, and provides a comprehensive review of current
      formulation trends for H. pylori eradication. Research effort has focused both on
      the discovery of new combinations of chemicals that function as optimized
      antibiotic regimens, and on the preparation of gastroretentive drug delivery
      systems (GRDDSs) to improve overall pharmacokinetics. Regarding the last topic,
      this review aims to summarize the latest trend in amoxicillin-loaded GRDDS, since
      this is the antibiotic that has shown the least bacterial resistance worldwide.
      It is expected that the current work could provide some insight into the
      importance of innovative options to combat this microorganism. Therefore, this
      review can inspire new research strategies in the development of efficient
      formulations for the treatment of this infection and the consequent prevention of
      gastric cancer.

TI  - Combination of Six Individual Derivatives of the Pom-1 Antibiofilm Peptide
      Doubles Their Efficacy against Invasive and Multi-Resistant Clinical Isolates of 
      the Pathogenic Yeast Candida&amp;nbsp;albicans.
LID - 1332 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics14071332 [doi]
AB  - In previous studies, derivatives of the peptide Pom-1, which was originally
      extracted from the freshwater mollusk Pomacea poeyana, showed an exceptional
      ability to specifically inhibit biofilm formation of the laboratory strain ATCC
      90028 as a model strain of the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans. In follow-up,
      here, we demonstrate that the derivatives Pom-1A to Pom-1F are also active
      against biofilms of invasive clinical C. albicans isolates, including strains
      resistant against fluconazole and/or amphotericin B. However, efficacy varied
      strongly between the isolates, as indicated by large deviations in the
      experiments. This lack of robustness could be efficiently bypassed by using
      mixtures of all peptides. These mixed peptide preparations were active against
      biofilm formation of all the isolates with uniform efficacies, and the total
      peptide concentration could be halved compared to the original MIC of the
      individual peptides (2.5 microg/mL). Moreover, mixing the individual peptides
      restored the antifungal effect of fluconazole against fluconazole-resistant
      isolates even at 50% of the standard therapeutic concentration. Without having
      elucidated the reason for these synergistic effects of the peptides yet, both the
      gain of efficacy and the considerable increase in efficiency by combining the
      peptides indicate that Pom-1 and its derivatives in suitable formulations may
      play an important role as new antibiofilm antimycotics in the fight against
      invasive clinical infections with (multi-) resistant C. albicans.

TI  - Optimization of Maduramicin Ammonium-Loaded Nanostructured Lipid Carriers Using
      Box-Behnken Design for Enhanced Anticoccidial Effect against Eimeria tenella in
      Broiler Chickens.
LID - 1330 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics14071330 [doi]
AB  - Maduramicin ammonium (MAD) is one of the most frequently used anticoccidial
      agents in broiler chickens. However, the high toxicity and low solubility of MAD 
      limit its clinical application. In this study, MAD-loaded nanostructured lipid
      carriers (MAD-NLCs) were prepared to overcome the defects of MAD by using highly 
      soluble nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs). The formulation was optimized via a
      three-level, three-factor Box-Behnken response surface method. Then, the optimal 
      MAD-NLCs were evaluated according to their hydrodynamic diameter (HD), zeta
      potential (ZP), crystal structure, encapsulation efficiency (EE), drug loading
      (DL), in vitro release, and anticoccidial effect. The optimal MAD-NLCs had an HD 
      of 153.6 +/- 3.044 nm and a ZP of -41.4 +/- 1.10 mV. The X-ray diffraction and
      Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy results indicated that the MAD was
      encapsulated in the NLCs in an amorphous state. The EE and DL were 90.49 +/-
      1.05% and 2.34 +/- 0.04%, respectively, which indicated that the MAD was
      efficiently encapsulated in the NLCs. In the in vitro study, the MAD-NLCs
      demonstrated a slow and sustained drug release behavior. Notably, MAD-NLCs had an
      excellent anticoccidial effect against Eimeria tenella in broiler chickens. In
      summary, MAD-NLCs have huge potential to form a new preparation administered via 
      drinking water with a powerful anticoccidial effect.

TI  - Palmitic Acid-Conjugated Radiopharmaceutical for Integrin alphavbeta3-Targeted
      Radionuclide Therapy.
LID - 1327 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics14071327 [doi]
AB  - Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) is an emerging approach for patients
      with unresectable or metastatic tumors. Our previously optimized RGD peptide
      (3PRGD2) has excellent targeting specificity for a variety of integrin
      alphavbeta3/alphavbeta5-positive tumors and has been labeled with the therapeutic
      radionuclide [(177)Lu]LuCl3 for targeted radiotherapy of tumors. However, the
      rapid clearance of [(177)Lu]Lu-DOTA-3PRGD2 ((177)Lu-3PRGD2) in vivo requires two 
      doses of 111 MBq/3 mCi to achieve effective tumor suppression, limiting its
      further clinical application. Albumin binders have been attached to drugs to
      facilitate binding to albumin in vivo to prolong the drug half-life in plasma and
      obtain long-term effects. In this study, we modified 3PRGD2 with albumin-binding 
      palmitic acid (Palm-3PRGD2) and then radiolabeled Palm-3PRGD2 with (177)Lu.
      [(177)Lu]Lu-DOTA-Palm-3PRGD2 ((177)Lu-Palm-3PRGD2) retained a specific binding
      affinity for integrin alphavbeta3/alphavbeta5, with an IC50 value of 5.13 +/-
      1.16 nM. Compared with (177)Lu-3PRGD2, the (177)Lu-Palm-3PRGD2 circulation time
      in blood was more than 6 times longer (slow half-life: 73.42 min versus 11.81
      min), and the tumor uptake increased more than fivefold (21.34 +/- 4.65 %IA/g and
      4.11 +/- 0.70 %IA/g at 12 h post-injection). Thus, the significant increase in
      tumor uptake and tumor retention resulted in enhanced efficacy of targeted
      radiotherapy, and tumor growth was completely inhibited by a single and
      relatively lowdose of 18.5 MBq/0.5 mCi. Thus, (177)Lu-Palm-3PRGD2 shows great
      potential for clinical application.

      Tools.
LID - 901 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ph15070901 [doi]
AB  - Data-independent acquisition (DIA) based strategies have been explored in recent 
      years for improving quantitative analysis of metabolites. However, the data
      analysis is challenging for DIA methods as the resulting spectra are highly
      multiplexed. Thus, the DIA mode requires advanced software analysis to facilitate
      the data deconvolution process. We proposed a pipeline for quantitative profiling
      of pharmaceutical drugs and serum metabolites in DIA mode after comparing the
      results obtained from full-scan, Data-dependent acquisition (DDA) and DIA modes. 
      using open-access software. Pharmaceutical drugs (10) were pooled in healthy
      human serum and analysed by LC-ESI-QTOF-MS. MS1 full-scan and Data-dependent
      (MS2) results were used for identification using MS-DIAL software while
      deconvolution of MS1/MS2 spectra in DIA mode was achieved by using Skyline
      software. The results of acquisition methods for quantitative analysis validated 
      the remarkable analytical performance of the constructed workflow, proving it to 
      be a sensitive and reproducible pipeline for biological complex fluids.

      cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) degradation. Regulatory organisations have 
      approved some substances in this category to reduce the risk of chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations in patients with chronic
      bronchitis and a history of COPD exacerbations. Roflumilast has been shown to
      alleviate inflammatory responses, thus regulating airway inflammation.
      Additionally, roflumilast therapy dramatically enhanced B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)
      expression, an anti-apoptotic marker lowered in septic animals. Previous research
      has indicated that roflumilast may help reverse sepsis-induced liver and lung
      harm, but whether it is also effective in reversing sepsis-induced renal
      impairment remains unknown. Therefore, this review determines whether roflumilast
      protects against renal dysfunction, inflammatory response, and apoptosis in
      sepsis-induced kidney damage. Additionally, we discussed the molecular mechanism 
      through which roflumilast exerts its protective effect to uncover a possible
      treatment agent for sepsis-induced renal impairment.

TI  - The Role of Interventional Irisin on Heart Molecular Physiology.
LID - 863 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ph15070863 [doi]
AB  - Irisin, encoded by the FNDC5 (fibronectin type III domain containing 5) gene, is 
      a novel myokine that has been implicated as an essential mediator of exercise
      benefits. Effects of irisin on heart physiology is still ambiguous. This study
      aimed to evaluate the impact of exogenous administration of irisin on heart
      physiology and the pharmacokinetic profile of pump-administered irisin. To do so,
      Sprague Dawley rats were implanted with an irisin-loaded osmotic pump (5
      mug/kg/day) for 42 days, and other animals were administered with single bolus
      subcutaneous injections of irisin (5 microg/kg). Body weights and blood samples
      were collected weekly for 42 days for serum irisin quantification and
      histopathology. Clinical biochemistry analyses were performed. Heart mRNA
      expression was assessed in 26 selected genes. Chronic interventional exogenous
      irisin significantly reduced body weight without affecting the heart myocyte size
      and significantly reduced creatine kinase enzyme level. Blood CBC, serum
      biochemistry, and heart morphology were normal. Gene expression of FNCD5, Raf1,
      CPT1, IGF-1, and CALCIN, encoding for heart physiology, increased while PGC1,
      Nox4, and Mfn1 significantly decreased. Nevertheless, irisin increased the
      expression of cardioprotective genes and inhibited some genes that harm heart
      physiology. Administration of irisin promotes myocardial functions and could be
      translated into clinical settings after preclinical profiling.

TI  - Selective COX-2 Inhibitors: Road from Success to Controversy and the Quest for
      Repurposing.
LID - 827 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ph15070827 [doi]
AB  - The introduction of selective COX-2 inhibitors (so-called 'coxibs') has
      demonstrated tremendous commercial success due to their claimed lower potential
      of serious gastrointestinal adverse effects than traditional NSAIDs. However,
      following the repeated questioning on safety concerns, the coxibs 'controversial 
      me-too' saga increased substantially, inferring to the risk of cardiovascular
      complications, subsequently leading to the voluntary withdrawal of coxibs (e.g., 
      rofecoxib and valdecoxib) from the market. For instance, the makers (Pfizer and
      Merck) had to allegedly settle individual claims of cardiovascular hazards from
      celecoxib and valdecoxib. Undoubtedly, the lessons drawn from this saga revealed 
      the flaws in drug surveillance and regulation, and taught science to pursue a
      more integrated translational approach for data acquisition and interpretation,
      prompting science-based strategies of risk avoidance in order to sustain the
      value of such drugs, rather than their withdrawal. Looking forward, coxibs are
      now being studied for repurposing, given their possible implications in the
      management of a myriad of diseases, including cancer, epilepsy, psychiatric
      disorders, obesity, Alzheimer's disease, and so on. This article briefly
      summarizes the development of COX-2 inhibitors to their market impression,
      followed by the controversy related to their toxicity. In addition, the events
      recollected in hindsight (the past lessons), the optimistic step towards drug
      repurposing (the present), and the potential for forthcoming success (the future)
      are also discussed.

TI  - Synthesis, Structure-Activity Relationships, and Parasitological Profiling of
      Brussonol Derivatives as New Plasmodium&amp;nbsp;falciparum Inhibitors.
LID - 814 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ph15070814 [doi]
AB  - Malaria is a parasitic disease caused by protozoan parasites from the genus
      Plasmodium. Plasmodium falciparum is the most prevalent species worldwide and the
      causative agent of severe malaria. The spread of resistance to the currently
      available antimalarial therapy is a major concern. Therefore, it is imperative to
      discover and develop new antimalarial drugs, which not only treat the disease but
      also control the emerging resistance. Brussonol is an icetexane derivative and a 
      member of a family of diterpenoids that have been isolated from several
      terrestrial plants. Here, the synthesis and antiplasmodial profiling of a series 
      of brussonol derivatives are reported. The compounds showed inhibitory activities
      in the low micromolar range against a panel of sensitive and resistant P.
      falciparum strains (IC50s = 5-16 muM). Moreover, brussonol showed fast-acting in 
      vitro inhibition and an additive inhibitory behavior when combined with the
      antimalarial artesunate (FICindex~1). The mode of action investigation indicated 
      that brussonol increased the cytosolic calcium levels within the parasite. Hence,
      the discovery of brussonol as a new scaffold endowed with antiplasmodial activity
      will enable us to design derivatives with improved properties to deliver new lead
      candidates for malaria.

TI  - Two Novel Co-Crystals of Naproxen: Comparison of Stability, Solubility and
      Intermolecular Interaction.
LID - 807 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ph15070807 [doi]
AB  - Two novel co-crystals of naproxen (NPX) were designed and prepared at a
      stoichiometric ratio of 1:1, namely, naproxen-caprolactam (NPX-CPL) and
      naproxen-oxymatrine (NPX-OMT). The characteristics of the co-crystals were
      evaluated in terms of stability and solubility studies. In terms of solubility,
      in four kinds of solvent systems with different pH, the solubility of NPX-OMT was
      significantly improved compared with that of NPX, whereas the NPX-CPL showed
      advantages in acidic solvent systems, indicating that the co-crystals can be
      applied to concoct preparations depending on therapeutic purposes. Furthermore,
      the experimental results of the thermal analysis showed that the co-crystal
      NPX-OMT had better thermal stability than the co-crystal NPX-CPL. Finally, as a
      complement to the single crystal X-ray diffraction (SC XRD) method, the
      theoretical calculation based on density functional theory (DFT) was also used to
      reveal the intermolecular interaction of the co-crystals at the molecular level
      and visually display the difference between them.

TI  - Adenine Combined with Cisplatin Promotes Anticancer Activity against
      Hepatocellular Cancer Cells through AMPK-Mediated p53/p21 and p38 MAPK Cascades.
LID - 795 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ph15070795 [doi]
AB  - Cisplatin has been widely used in cancer treatments. Recent evidence indicates
      that adenine has potential anticancer activities against various types of
      cancers. However, the effects of the combination of adenine and cisplatin on
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells remain sketchy. Here, our objective was to
      elucidate the anticancer activity of adenine in combination with cisplatin in HCC
      cells and its mechanistic pathways. Cell viability and cell cycle progression
      were assessed by the SRB assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Apoptosis was
      demonstrated by PI/annexin V staining and flow cytometric analysis. Protein
      expression, signaling cascade, and mRNA expression were analyzed by Western
      blotting and quantitative RT-PCR, respectively. Our results showed that adenine
      jointly potentiated the inhibitory effects of cisplatin on the cell viability of 
      SK-Hep1 and Huh7 cells. Further investigation showed that adenine combined with
      cisplatin induced higher S phase arrest and apoptosis in HCC cells. Mechanically,
      adenine induced AMPK activation, reduced mTOR phosphorylation, and increased p53 
      and p21 levels. The combination of adenine and cisplatin synergistically reduced 
      Bcl-2 and increased PUMA, cleaved caspase-3, and PARP in HCC cells. Adenine also 
      upregulated the mRNA expression of p53, p21, PUMA, and PARP, while knockdown of
      AMPK reduced the increased expression of these genes. Furthermore, adenine also
      induced the activation of p38 MAPK through AMPK signaling, and the inhibition of 
      p38 MAPK reduced the apoptosis of HCC cells with exposure to adenine combined
      with cisplatin. Collectively, these findings reveal that the combination of
      adenine and cisplatin synergistically enhances apoptosis of HCC cells, which may 
      be attributed to the AMPK-mediated p53/p21 and p38 MAPK cascades. It suggests
      that adenine may be a potential adjuvant for the treatment of HCC in combination 
      with cisplatin.

TI  - Establishing Minimal Conditions Sufficient for the Development of Titan-like
      Cells in Cryptococcus neoformans/gattii Species Complex.
LID - 768 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pathogens11070768 [doi]
AB  - Opportunistic pathogens of the anamorphic genus Cryptococcus are unique
      considering their virulence factors that in the context of pathogenesis allowed
      them to achieve evolutionary success. Morphological transformation into giant
      (Titan) cells is one of the factors contributing to cryptococcosis. Recently
      established in vitro protocols demonstrate that 5 or 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)
      combined with 5% CO2, 37 degrees C, and sufficiently low cell density, triggers
      cellular enlargement (Serum protocols). However, the FBS components that promote 
      this morphological transition remain incompletely characterized. In search of
      minimal conditions necessary for stimulating the formation of Titan cells, we
      performed a study where we eliminated serum from the protocol (Serum-free
      protocol) and instead systematically adjusted the amount of glucose, source of
      nitrogen (ammonium sulfate), and the pH. We found that exposing cells to PBS with
      adjusted pH to 7.3, and supplemented with 0.05% glucose, 0.025% ammonium sulfate,
      0.004% K2HPO4, 0.0035% MgSO4, in the presence of 5% CO2 at 37 degrees C triggers 
      Titan-like cell formation to the same degree as the previously established
      protocol that utilized 10% FBS as the sole nutrient source. Titan-like cells
      obtained according to this Serum-free protocol were characterized by cell body
      size over ten microns, a single enlarged vacuole, thick cell wall, extensive
      polysaccharide capsule, and changes in the level of cell ploidy, all currently
      known hallmarks of Titan cells found in vivo. Strikingly, we found that in both, 
      Serum and Serum-free protocols, an optimal pH for Titan-like cell development is 
      ~7.3 whereas relatively acidic pH (5.5) prevents this morphological transition
      and promotes robust proliferation, while alkaline pH (~8.0) has a profound growth
      inhibitory effect. Our study demonstrates a critical role of pH response to the
      formation of Titan cells and indicates that conditions that allow restricted
      proliferation in the presence of 5% CO2 are sufficient for this morphological
      transition to form enlarged cells in Cryptococcus neoformans and
      Cryptococcus&amp;nbsp;gattii species complex.

TI  - Interrelation between Stress Management and Secretion Systems of Ralstonia
      solanacearum: An In Silico Assessment.
LID - 730 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pathogens11070730 [doi]
AB  - Ralstonia solanacearum (Rs), the causative agent of devastating wilt disease in
      several major and minor economic crops, is considered one of the most destructive
      bacterial plant pathogens. However, the mechanism(s) by which Rs counteracts
      host-associated environmental stress is still not clearly elucidated. To
      investigate possible stress management mechanisms, orthologs of stress-responsive
      genes in the Rs genome were searched using a reference set of known genes. The
      genome BLAST approach was used to find the distributions of these orthologs
      within different Rs strains. BLAST results were first confirmed from the KEGG
      Genome database and then reconfirmed at the protein level from the UniProt
      database. The distribution pattern of these stress-responsive factors was
      explored through multivariate analysis and STRING analysis. STRING analysis of
      stress-responsive genes in connection with different secretion systems of Rs was 
      also performed. Initially, a total of 28 stress-responsive genes of Rs were
      confirmed in this study. STRING analysis revealed an additional 7
      stress-responsive factors of Rs, leading to the discovery of a total of 35
      stress-responsive genes. The segregation pattern of these 35 genes across 110 Rs 
      genomes was found to be almost homogeneous. Increasing interactions of Rs stress 
      factors were observed in six distinct clusters, suggesting six different types of
      stress responses: membrane stress response (MSR), osmotic stress response (OSR), 
      oxidative stress response (OxSR), nitrosative stress response (NxSR), and DNA
      damage stress response (DdSR). Moreover, a strong network of these stress
      responses was observed with type 3 secretion system (T3SS), general secretory
      proteins (GSPs), and different types of pili (T4P, Tad, and Tat). To the best of 
      our knowledge, this is the first report on overall stress response management by 
      Rs and the potential connection with secretion systems.

      Patients with Coexisting HBsAg and Anti-HBs.
LID - 727 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pathogens11070727 [doi]
AB  - Antibodies in response to antigens are related to the immune repertoire of T- and
      B-cell receptors. However, some patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) have
      coexisting HBsAg and anti-HBsAg antibodies (anti-HBs) that cannot neutralize HBV.
      We attempted to investigate the repertoires that produce this response in CHB
      patients. The T-cell receptor beta chain (TRB) and B-cell receptor (BCR)
      repertoires of peripheral blood genomic DNA were analyzed using MiXCR. T-cell
      receptor (TCR) cluster analysis was carried out by clusTCR, and motifs prediction
      was selected by Multiple Em for Motif Elicitation (MEME). A total of 76 subjects 
      were enrolled, including 26 HBsAg and anti-HBs coexisting patients with CHB (DP
      group), 25 anti-HBs single-positive healthy people (SP group), and 25 CHB
      patients (CHB group). The clone length of BCR in 39, 90 was significantly
      different among these groups (p = 0.005, 0.036). The motif "CASSLG" in the DP
      group was significantly higher than SP and CHB groups and may relate to
      coexistence, and the motif "GAGPLT" was only shown in the SP group and may relate
      to anti-HB expression. These provide important insights into vaccine development 
      and CHB treatment.

TI  - Global Trends in the Availability of Dietary Data in Low and Middle-Income
      Countries.
LID - 2987 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14142987 [doi]
AB  - Individual-level quantitative dietary data can provide suitably disaggregated
      information to identify the needs of all population sub-groups, which can in turn
      inform agricultural, nutrition, food safety, and environmental policies and
      programs. The purpose of this discussion paper is to provide an overview of
      dietary surveys conducted in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) from 1980
      to 2019, analyzing their key characteristics to understand the trends in dietary 
      data collection across time. The present study analyzes the information gathered 
      by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations/World Health
      Organization Global Individual Food consumption data Tool (FAO/WHO GIFT). FAO/WHO
      GIFT is a growing repository of individual-level dietary data and contains
      information about dietary surveys from around the world, collected through
      published survey results, literature reviews, and direct contact with data
      owners. The analysis indicates an important increase in the number of dietary
      surveys conducted in LMICs in the past four decades and a notable increase in the
      number of national dietary surveys. It is hoped that this trend continues,
      together with associated efforts to validate and standardize the dietary methods 
      used. The regular implementation of dietary surveys in LMICs is key to support
      evidence-based policies for improved nutrition.

TI  - Neutrophil Extracellular Traps Promote NLRP3 Inflammasome Activation and
      Glomerular Endothelial Dysfunction in Diabetic Kidney Disease.
LID - 2965 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14142965 [doi]
AB  - Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disease largely due to lifestyle and nutritional
      imbalance, resulting in insulin resistance, hyperglycemia and vascular
      complications. Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a major cause of end-stage renal 
      failure contributing to morbidity and mortality worldwide. Therapeutic options to
      prevent or reverse DKD progression are limited. Endothelial and glomerular
      filtration barrier (GFB) dysfunction and sterile inflammation are associated with
      DKD. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), originally identified as an innate
      immune mechanism to combat infection, have been implicated in sterile
      inflammatory responses in non-communicable diseases. However, the contribution of
      NETs in DKD remains unknown. Here, we show that biomarkers of NETs are increased 
      in diabetic mice and diabetic patients and that these changes correlate with DKD 
      severity. Mechanistically, NETs promote NLRP3 inflammasome activation and
      glomerular endothelial dysfunction under high glucose stress in vitro and in
      vivo. Inhibition of NETs (PAD4 inhibitor) ameliorate endothelial dysfunction and 
      renal injury in DKD. Taken together, NET-induced sterile inflammation promotes
      diabetes-associated endothelial dysfunction, identifying a new pathomechanism
      contributing to DKD. Inhibition of NETs may be a promising therapeutic strategy
      in DKD.

TI  - The Mediterranean Diet: An Update of the Clinical Trials.
LID - 2956 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14142956 [doi]
AB  - The Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet) is a term used to identify a dietary pattern
      originating from the unique multi-millennial interplay between natural food
      resources and the eating practices of people living in the Mediterranean basin.
      Scientific evidence has described the healthy properties of the MedDiet and its
      beneficial role in several pathological conditions. Nevertheless, current
      socio-economic trends have moved people away from this healthy lifestyle. Thus,
      clinical and biological evidence supporting the benefits of the MedDiet is needed
      to overcome these limitations. Clinical nutrition research examines the effects
      of dietary interventions on biological or health-related outcomes in a determined
      study population. The evidence produced by these studies is useful for dietary
      guidance and public health messaging. We provided an update of the clinical
      trials registered on the database clinicaltrials.gov evaluating the effects of
      the MedDiet on health and specific diseases. Our findings revealed an increased
      number of clinical trials in the last decade and found that most disease-related 
      studies focused on cardiovascular diseases, metabolic diseases, and cancer. The
      majority of MedDiet's beneficial effects could be primarily related to its
      anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties as well as the effectiveness of
      this dietary pattern in controlling waist circumference and obesity. Moreover,
      strict and long-lasting adherence to the MedDiet as well as the beneficial
      effects of specific components (e.g., olive oil or its polyphenols) seem to
      emerge as useful insights for interventional improvements. These findings present
      further insights into the MedDiet's resources and how it could strengthen overall
      public health.

TI  - Effect of Cheese Intake on Cardiovascular Diseases and Cardiovascular Biomarkers.
LID - 2936 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14142936 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A growing number of cohort studies revealed an inverse association
      between cheese intake and cardiovascular diseases, yet the causal relationship is
      unclear. OBJECTIVE: To assess the causal relationship between cheese intake, and 
      cardiovascular diseases and cardiovascular biomarkers. METHODS: A two-sample
      Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis based on publicly available genome-wide
      association studies was employed to infer the causal relationship. The effect
      estimates were calculated using the random-effects inverse-variance-weighted
      method. RESULTS: Cheese intake per standard deviation increase causally reduced
      the risks of type 2 diabetes (odds ratio (OR) = 0.46; 95% confidence interval
      (CI), 0.34-0.63; p = 1.02 x 10(-6)), heart failure (OR = 0.62; 95% CI, 0.49-0.79;
      p = 0.0001), coronary heart disease (OR = 0.65; 95% CI, 0.53-0.79; p = 2.01 x
      10(-5)), hypertension (OR = 0.67; 95% CI, 0.53-0.84; p = 0.001), and ischemic
      stroke (OR = 0.76; 95% CI, 0.63-0.91; p = 0.003). Suggestive evidence of an
      inverse association between cheese intake and peripheral artery disease was also 
      observed. No associations were observed for atrial fibrillation, cardiac death,
      pulmonary embolism, or transient ischemic attack. The better prognosis associated
      with cheese intake may be explained by lower body mass index (BMI; effect
      estimate = -0.58; 95% CI, from -0.88 to -0.27; p = 0.0002), waist circumference
      (effect estimate = -0.49; 95% CI, from -0.76 to -0.23; p = 0.0003), triglycerides
      (effect estimate = -0.33; 95% CI, from -0.50 to -0.17; p = 4.91 x 10(-5)), and
      fasting glucose (effect estimate = -0.20; 95% CI, from -0.33 to -0.07; p =
      0.0003). There was suggestive evidence of a positive association between cheese
      intake and high-density lipoprotein. No influences were observed for blood
      pressure or inflammation biomarkers. CONCLUSIONS: This two-sample MR analysis
      found causally inverse associations between cheese intake and type 2 diabetes,
      heart failure, coronary heart disease, hypertension, and ischemic stroke.

TI  - Anti-Obesity Effects of Aqueous Extracts of Sunbanghwalmyung-Eum in High-Fat- and
      High-Cholesterol-Diet-Induced Obese C57BL/6J Mice.
LID - 2929 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14142929 [doi]
AB  - Sunbanghwalmyung-eum (SBH) is a traditional herbal medicine that exhibits various
      pharmacological properties, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and
      anticancer activities. In this study, we investigated the systemic anti-obesity
      effects of an aqueous extract of SBH in the liver, adipose, and muscle tissue
      from high-fat and high-cholesterol diet (HFHCD)-induced obese C57BL/6J mice.
      After 6 weeks of an HFHCD, the mice were continuously fed HFHC with oral
      administration of SBH (100 mg/kg/day), Sim (simvastatin, 5 mg/kg/day, positive
      control), or water (HFHC only) for another 6 weeks. Our results showed that SBH
      attenuated the HFHCD-induced body weight gain and fat accumulation in the liver, 
      and improved plasma lipid levels, such as those of triglycerides (TGs), blood
      total cholesterol (TC), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL-c). SBH and Sim
      inhibited the inflammation accompanied by obesity via decreasing inflammatory
      cytokine interleukin (IL)-1beta, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), and
      monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1). Moreover, SBH downregulated the
      expression of protein levels of adipogenic-related factors, including peroxisome 
      proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding
      protein alpha (C/EBPalpha), in the liver, adipose, and muscle tissue. The SBH and
      Sim treatment also significantly upregulated the phosphorylation of AMP-activated
      protein kinase alpha (AMPKalpha) in the liver and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) 
      in the adipose tissue. Overall, the effects of SBH on HFHCD-induced obesity were 
      similar to or more potent than those of simvastatin. These results indicated that
      SBH has great potential as a therapeutic herbal medicine for obesity.

TI  - Seabuckthorn Reverses High-Fat-Diet-Induced Obesity and Enhances Fat Browning via
      Activation of AMPK/SIRT1 Pathway.
LID - 2903 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14142903 [doi]
AB  - Seabuckthorn possesses various bioactive compounds and exhibits several positive 
      pharmacological activities. The present trial aims to determine the effect of
      seabuckthorn powder intake on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity prevention in
      mice. The results suggest that seabuckthorn powder intake decreased body weight, 
      fat mass, and circulating lipid levels, and improved insulin sensitivity in
      HFD-fed mice. Moreover, dietary seabuckthorn powder alleviated hepatic steatosis 
      and hepatic lipid accumulation induced by the HFD. Furthermore, seabuckthorn
      exhibited obvious anti-inflammatory capacity in white adipose tissue (WAT) by
      regulating the abundance of inflammation-related cytokines, such as interleukins 
      4, 6, and 10; tumor necrosis factor alpha; and interferon-gamma. More
      importantly, dietary seabuckthorn powder promoted a thermogenic program in BAT
      and induced beige adipocyte formation in iWAT in HFD-fed mice. Interestingly, we 
      found that seabuckthorn powder effectively restored AMPK and SIRT1 activities in 
      both BAT and iWAT in HFD-fed mice. Collectively, these results potentiate the
      application of seabuckthorn powder as a nutritional intervention strategy to
      prevent obesity and related metabolic diseases by promoting thermogenesis in BAT 
      and improving beige adipocyte formation in WAT.

TI  - Evaluation of the Effectiveness of Fermented Soybean-Lettuce Powder for Improving
      Menopausal Symptoms.
LID - 2878 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14142878 [doi]
AB  - Menopause syndrome causes a decline in the quality of life of postmenopausal
      women. Hormone therapy is recommended for the treatment of menopausal syndromes. 
      However, it has several side effects. Soybean has been safely used to relieve the
      symptoms of menopause. Lettuce has antidiabetic and anti-inflammatory effects and
      improves sleep quality. Natural nitric oxide metabolites are produced through
      fermentation, which increases the effectiveness of the functional substances.
      This study assessed the alleviation of menopausal syndrome symptoms by natural
      nitric oxide-containing soybean lettuce extract using the Kupperman index. This
      study included adult women with menopausal syndrome and a Kupperman index of
      >/=15. After a four-week study with 40 participants, the final analysis included 
      39 participants in the experimental group (n = 19) and the placebo group (n =
      20). Body mass index, waist circumference, and the total cholesterol, low-density
      and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride levels were not
      altered before and after treatment in both groups. There was a significant
      decrease in the Kupperman index after treatment in the experimental group, but no
      significant change was observed in the placebo group. Soybean lettuce extract
      alleviates menopause syndrome without any special side effects.

TI  - Renoprotective Effect of Pediococcus acidilactici GKA4 on Cisplatin-Induced Acute
      Kidney Injury by Mitigating Inflammation and Oxidative Stress and Regulating the 
      MAPK, AMPK/SIRT1/NF-kappaB, and PI3K/AKT Pathways.
LID - 2877 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14142877 [doi]
AB  - Acute kidney injury (AKI) describes a sudden loss of kidney function and is
      associated with a high mortality. Pediococcus acidilactici is a potent producer
      of bacteriocin and inhibits the growth of pathogens during fermentation and food 
      storage; it has been used in the food industry for many years. In this study, the
      potential of P. acidilactici GKA4 (GKA4) to ameliorate AKI was investigated using
      a cisplatin-induced animal model. First, mice were given oral GKA4 for ten days
      and intraperitoneally injected with cisplatin on the seventh day to create an AKI
      mode. GKA4 attenuated renal histopathological alterations, serum biomarkers, the 
      levels of inflammatory mediators, and lipid oxidation in cisplatin-induced
      nephrotoxicity. Moreover, GKA4 significantly decreased the expression of
      inflammation-related proteins and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in
      kidney tissues. Eventually, GKA4 also increased the levels of related antioxidant
      enzymes and pathways. Consistently, sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) upregulated the level of
      autophagy-related proteins (LC3B, p62, and Beclin1). Further studies are needed
      to check our results and advance our knowledge of the mechanism whereby PI3K
      inhibition (wortmannin) reverses the effect of GKA4 on cisplatin-treated AKI.
      Taken together, GKA4 provides a therapeutic target with promising clinical
      potential after cisplatin treatment by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation
      via the MAPK, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/SIRT1/nuclear factor kappa B
      (NF-kappaB), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)
      axes.

TI  - Alginate Oligosaccharides Ameliorate DSS-Induced Colitis through Modulation of
      AMPK/NF-kappaB Pathway and Intestinal Microbiota.
LID - 2864 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14142864 [doi]
AB  - Alginate oligosaccharides (AOS) are shown to have various biological activities
      of great value to medicine, food, and agriculture. However, little information is
      available about their beneficial effects and mechanisms on ulcerative colitis. In
      this study, AOS with a polymerization degree between 2 and 4 were found to
      possess anti-inflammatory effects in vitro and in vivo. AOS could decrease the
      levels of nitric oxide (NO), IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNFalpha, and upregulate the
      levels of IL-10 in both RAW 264.7 and bone-marrow-derived macrophage (BMDM) cells
      under lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. Additionally, oral AOS administration
      could significantly prevent bodyweight loss, colonic shortening, and rectal
      bleeding in dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis mice. AOS pretreatment
      could also reduce disease activity index scores and histopathologic scores and
      downregulate proinflammatory cytokine levels. Importantly, AOS administration
      could reverse DSS-induced AMPK deactivation and NF-kappaB activation in colonic
      tissues, as evidenced by enhanced AMPK phosphorylation and p65 phosphorylation
      inhibition. AOS could also upregulate AMPK phosphorylation and inhibit NF-kappaB 
      activation in vitro. Moreover, 16S rRNA gene sequencing of gut microbiota
      indicated that supplemental doses of AOS could affect overall gut microbiota
      structure to a varying extent and specifically change the abundance of some
      bacteria. Medium-dose AOS could be superior to low- or high-dose AOS in
      maintaining remission in DSS-induced colitis mice. In conclusion, AOS can play a 
      protective role in colitis through modulation of gut microbiota and the
      AMPK/NF-kB pathway.

TI  - Sword Bean (Canavalia gladiata) Pod Exerts Anti-Allergic and Anti-Inflammatory
      Effects through Modulation of Th1/Th2 Cell Differentiation.
LID - 2853 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14142853 [doi]
AB  - Allergy is an immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated process, and its incidence and
      prevalence have increased worldwide in recent years. Therapeutic agents for
      allergic diseases are continuously being developed, but side effects follow when 
      used for a long-term use. Therefore, treatments based on natural products that
      are safe for the body are urgently required. Sword bean (Canavalia gladiata) pod 
      (SBP) has been traditionally used to treat inflammatory diseases, but there is
      still no scientific basis for its anti-allergic effect. Accordingly, this study
      investigates the anti-allergic effect and its mechanism of SBP in vitro and in
      vivo. SBP reduced the nitric oxide production and decreased mRNA and protein
      expression of inflammatory mediates (inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and
      cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)), and inhibited the phosphorylation of nuclear factor
      kappa B (NF-kappaB), a major signaling molecule in the inflammatory response.
      Additionally, SBP extract treatment inhibited
      phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/mTOR) signaling
      activity to further inhibit degranulation and allergy mediator generation and
      control the balance of Th1/Th2 cells, which can induce an allergic reaction when 
      disrupted. Furthermore, the SBP extract exhibited anti-allergic effects in
      anti-dinitrophenyl IgE-induced RBL-2H3 cells and ovalbumin-treated mice. These
      findings have potential clinical implications for the treatment as well as
      prevention of allergic diseases.

TI  - Protective Effect of Eurotium cristatum Fermented Loose Dark Tea and Eurotium

      Cigarette Exposure in Mice.
LID - 2843 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14142843 [doi]
AB  - Electronic-cigarette smoke (eCS) has been shown to cause a degree of oxidative
      stress and inflammatory damage in lung tissue. The aim of this study was to
      evaluate the repair mechanism of Eurotium cristatum fermented loose dark tea
      (ECT) and Eurotium cristatum particle metabolites (ECP) sifted from ECT after
      eCS-induced injury in mice. Sixty C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into a blank
      control group, an eCS model group, an eCS + 600 mg/kg ECP treatment group, an eCS
      + 600 mg/kg ECT treatment group, an eCS + 600 mg/kg ECP prevention group, and an 
      eCS + 600 mg/kg ECT prevention group. The results show that ECP and ECT
      significantly reduced the eCS-induced oxidative stress and inflammation and
      improved histopathological changes in the lungs in mice with eCS-induced liver
      injury. Western blot analysis further revealed that ECP and ECT significantly
      inhibited the eCS-induced upregulation of the phosphorylation levels of the
      extracellular Regulated protein Kinases (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and 
      p38mitogen-activated protein kinases (p38MAPK) proteins, and significantly
      increased the eCS-induced downregulation of the expression levels of the pregnane
      X receptor (PXR) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) proteins. Conclusively,
      these findings show that ECP and ECT have a significant repairing effect on the
      damage caused by eCS exposure through the MAPK and PXR/AhR signaling pathways;
      ECT has a better effect on preventing eCS-induced injury and is suitable as a
      daily healthcare drink; ECP has a better therapeutic effect after eCS-induced
      injury, and might be a potential therapeutic candidate for the treatment of
      eCS-induced injury.

TI  - Thymol Alleviates LPS-Induced Liver Inflammation and Apoptosis by Inhibiting
      NLRP3 Inflammasome Activation and the AMPK-mTOR-Autophagy Pathway.
LID - 2809 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14142809 [doi]
AB  - Thymol is a natural antibacterial agent found in the essential oil extracted from
      thyme, which has been proven to be beneficial in food and medicine. Meanwhile,
      the NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and
      autophagy have been reported to play key roles in the progression of liver
      injury. However, the effects of thymol on the NLRP3 inflammasome and autophagy in
      protecting the liver remain unclear. The present study used a mouse model with
      liver injury induced by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) to investigate the regulatory
      mechanisms of thymol. We found that thymol alleviated LPS-induced liver
      structural damage, as judged by reduced inflammatory cell infiltration and
      improved structure. In addition, elevated levels of the liver damage indicators
      (alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), and total bilirubin
      (TBIL)) dropped after thymol administration. The mRNA and protein expression of
      inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6,
      and IL-22), apoptosis-related genes (caspase3 and caspase9), and the activity of 
      apoptosis-related genes (caspase3 and caspase9) were increased in LPS-treated
      livers, whereas the changes were alleviated after thymol administration. Thymol
      inhibited LPS-induced increment in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in
      primary hepatocytes of the mouse. In addition, thymol protected mice from liver
      injury by inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation induced by LPS.
      Mechanistically, the present study indicates that thymol has liver protective
      activity resulting from the modulation of the AMP-activated protein
      kinase-mammalian target of rapamycin (AMPK-mTOR) to regulate the autophagy
      pathway, hence curbing inflammation.

TI  - A 3-Year Longitudinal Study of Effects of Parental Feeding Practices on Child
      Weight Status: The Childhood Obesity Study in China Mega-Cities.

LID - 10.3390/nu14142797 [doi]
AB  - This study examined the longitudinal associations between parental feeding
      practices and child weight status, and their potential modification effects by
      child sex, age, and maternal and paternal educations among children. Data were
      collected from 2015 to 2017 of 2139 children aged 6-17 years and their parents in
      five Chinese mega-cities. Parental feeding practices were assessed using 11-items
      from Child Feeding Questionnaire. Waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), body mass index
      (BMI), and general and central obesity were measured and analyzed using a
      mixed-effects model. Three parental feeding patterns were identified by factor
      analysis including "concern", "pressure to eat", and "control". Concern was
      associated with higher BMI z-score, WHtR (betas ranged from 0.01 to 0.16), and
      general obesity (ORs ranged from 1.29 to 6.41) among children aged </=12 years
      and &gt;12 years, regardless of child sex and parental educations. Pressure to
      eat was associated with lower BMI z-score (beta = -0.08, p &lt; 0.001), WHtR
      (beta = -0.004, p &lt; 0.01), and general (OR = 0.53, 95%CI = 0.42, 0.66) and
      central obesity (OR = 0.72, 95%CI = 0.58, 0.90) among children aged </=12 years. 
      Further analyses showed that significant associations were found for children
      with maternal or paternal education of college and above. Control was associated 
      with increased risk of general and central obesity among children with maternal
      education of college and above, regardless of age. Our study indicates that
      higher concern and lower pressure to eat were associated with increased risk of
      obesity among children. Control was associated with increased risk of obesity
      among children with maternal education of college and above. Future childhood
      obesity preventions may optimize parental feeding practices.

TI  - Exogenous Nucleotides Improved the Oxidative Stress and Sirt-1 Protein Level of
      Brown Adipose Tissue on Senescence-Accelerated Mouse Prone-8 (SAMP8) Mice.
LID - 2796 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14142796 [doi]
AB  - Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is of great importance in rodents for maintaining
      their core temperature via non-shivering thermogenesis in the mitochondria. BAT's
      thermogenic function has been shown to decline with age. The activation of
      adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase/sirtuin-1 (AMPK/Sirt-1)
      is effective in regulating mitochondrial function. Exogenous nucleotides (NTs)
      are regulatory factors in many biological processes. Nicotinamide mononucleotide 
      (NMN), which is a derivative of NTs, is widely known as a Sirt-1 activator in
      liver and muscle, but the effect of NMN and NTs on aging BAT has not been studied
      before. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of NTs on aging
      senescence-accelerated mouse prone-8 (SAMP8) mice. Senescence-accelerated mouse
      resistant 1 (SAMR1) mice were set as the model control group and NMN was used as 
      the positive control. Male, 3 month old SAMP8 mice were divided into the
      SAMP8-normal chow (SAMP8-NC), SAMP8-young-normal chow (SAMP8-young-NC), NMN,
      NTs-free, NTs-low, NTs-medium, and NTs-high groups for long-term feeding. After 9
      months of intervention, interscapular BAT was collected for experiments. Compared
      to the SAMP8-NC, the body weight and BAT mass were significantly improved in the 
      NT-treated aging SAMP8 mice. NT supplementation had effects on oxidative stress
      in BAT. The concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA) was reduced and that of
      superoxide dismutase (SOD) increased significantly. Meanwhile, the expression of 
      the brown adipocyte markers uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1), peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactlvator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha), and PR
      domain zinc finger protein 16 (PRDM16) were upregulated. The upregulated proteins
      may be activated via the Sirt-1 pathway. Thus, NT supplementation may be helpful 
      to improve the thermogenesis of BAT by reducing oxidative stress and activating
      the Sirt-1 pathway.

TI  - ER-Stress and Senescence Coordinately Promote Endothelial Barrier Dysfunction in 
      Diabetes-Induced Atherosclerosis.
LID - 2786 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14142786 [doi]
AB  - Diabetes mellitus is hallmarked by accelerated atherosclerosis, a major cause of 
      mortality among patients with diabetes. Efficient therapies for
      diabetes-associated atherosclerosis are absent. Accelerated atherosclerosis in
      diabetic patients is associated with reduced endothelial thrombomodulin (TM)
      expression and impaired activated protein C (aPC) generation. Here, we directly
      compared the effects of high glucose and oxidized LDL, revealing that high
      glucose induced more pronounced responses in regard to maladaptive unfolded
      protein response (UPR), senescence, and vascular endothelial cell barrier
      disruption. Ex vivo, diabetic ApoE(-/-) mice displayed increased levels of
      senescence and UPR markers within atherosclerotic lesions compared with
      nondiabetic ApoE(-/-) mice. Activated protein C pretreatment maintained barrier
      permeability and prevented glucose-induced expression of senescence and UPR
      markers in vitro. These data suggest that high glucose-induced maladaptive UPR
      and associated senescence promote vascular endothelial cell dysfunction,
      which-however-can be reversed by aPC. Taken together, current data suggest that
      reversal of glucose-induced vascular endothelial cell dysfunction is feasible.

      Molecular Beam Epitaxy.
LID - 2508 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nano12142508 [doi]
AB  - AlGaN nanorods have attracted increasing amounts of attention for use in
      ultraviolet (UV) optoelectronic devices. Here, self-assembled AlGaN nanorods with
      embedding quantum disks (Qdisks) were grown on Si(111) using plasma-assisted
      molecular beam epitaxy (PA-MBE). The morphology and quantum construction of the
      nanorods were investigated and well-oriented and nearly defect-free nanorods were
      shown to have a high density of about 2 x 10(10) cm(-2). By controlling the
      substrate temperature and Al/Ga ratio, the emission wavelengths of the nanorods
      could be adjusted from 276 nm to 330 nm. By optimizing the structures and growth 
      parameters of the Qdisks, a high internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of the AlGaN
      Qdisk nanorods of up to 77% was obtained at 305 nm, which also exhibited a shift 
      in the small emission wavelength peak with respect to the increasing temperatures
      during the PL measurements.

TI  - Mechanism for the Intercalation of Aniline Cations into the Interlayers of
      Graphite.
LID - 2486 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nano12142486 [doi]
AB  - The dynamic behaviors of aniline cation (ANI(+)) intercalating into graphite
      interlayers are systematically studied by experimental studies and multiscale
      simulations. The in situ intercalation polymerization designed by response
      surface methods implies the importance of ultrasonication for achieving the
      intercalation of ANI(+). Molecular dynamics and quantum chemical simulations
      prove the adsorption of ANI(+) onto graphite surfaces by cation-pi electrostatic 
      interactions, weakening the pi-pi interactions between graphene layers. The
      ultrasonication that follows breaks the hydrated ANI(+) clusters into individual 
      ANI(+). Thus, the released positive charges of these dissociative cations and
      reduced steric hindrance significantly improve their intercalation ability. With 
      the initial kinetic energy provided by ultrasonic field, the activated ANI(+) are
      able to intercalate into the interlayer of graphite. This work demonstrates the
      intercalation behaviors of ANI(+), which provides an opportunity for
      investigations regarding organic-molecule-intercalated graphite compounds.

AB  - In the presented study, we developed a nanogold lateral glow immunoassay-based
      technique (LFI-COVID-19 antigen test) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2
      nucleocapsid proteins; the developed LFI-COVID-19 Ag test has been tested for
      limit of detection (LOD), cross-reactivity and interfering substances, and
      performance. It was found that the performance of the developed LFI-COVID-19
      antigen test when it was evaluated by RT-qPCR indicated 95, 98, and 97% for
      sensitivity, specificity and accuracy, respectively. This complies with the WHO
      guidelines. It was concluded that the developed LFI-COVID-19 antigen test is a
      point of care and an alternative approach to current laboratory methods,
      especially RT-qPCR. It provides an easy, rapid (within 20 min), and on-site
      diagnostic tool for COVID-19 infection, and it is a cheap test if it is
      manufactured on a large scale for commercial use.

TI  - Photothermal Regulated Nanozyme of CuFeS2 Nanoparticles for Efficiently Promoting
      Wound Healing Infected by Multidrug Resistant Bacteria.
LID - 2469 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nano12142469 [doi]
AB  - Peroxidase-mediated chemokinetic therapy (CDT) can effectively resist bacteria;
      however, factors such as the high dosage of drugs seriously limit the
      antibacterial effect. Herein, CuFeS2 nanoparticles (NPs) nanozyme antibacterial
      system with the photothermal effect and peroxidase-like catalytic activity are
      proposed as a combined antibacterial agent with biosafety, high-efficiency, and
      broad-spectrum antibacterial ability. In addition, the as-obtained CuFeS2 NPs
      with a low doses of Cu(+) and Fe(3+) can change the permeability of bacterial
      cell membranes and break the antioxidant balance by consuming intracellular
      glutathione (GSH), which results in more conducive ROS production. Meanwhile, the
      photothermal heating can regulate the CuFeS2 NPs close to their optimal reaction 
      temperature (60 degrees C) to release more hydroxyl radical in low concentrations
      of H2O2 (100 microM). The proposed CuFeS2 NPs-based antibacterial system achieve 
      more than 99% inactivation efficiency of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
      aureus (10(6) CFU mL(-1) MRSA), hyperspectral bacteria beta-Escherichia coli
      (10(6) CFU mL(-1) ESBL) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10(6) CFU mL(-1) PA), even at
      low concentration (2 mug mL(-1)), which is superior to those of the conventional 
      CuO NPs at 4 mg mL(-1) reported in the literature. In vivo experiments further
      confirm that CuFeS2 NPs can effectively treat wounds infected by MRSA and promote
      the wound healing. This study demonstrates that excellent antibacterial ability
      and good biocompatibility make CuFeS2 NPs a potential anti-infection nanozyme
      with broad application prospects.

TI  - Regulation of Kinetic Properties of Chemical Hydrogen Absorption and Desorption
      by Cubic K2MoO4 on Magnesium Hydride.
LID - 2468 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nano12142468 [doi]
AB  - Transition metal catalysts are particularly effective in improving the kinetics
      of the reversible hydrogen storage reaction for light metal hydrides. Herein,
      K2MoO4 microrods were prepared using a simple evaporative crystallization method,
      and it was confirmed that the kinetic properties of magnesium hydride could be
      adjusted by doping cubic K2MoO4 into MgH2. Its unique cubic structure forms new
      species in the process of hydrogen absorption and desorption, which shows
      excellent catalytic activity in the process of hydrogen storage in MgH2. The
      dissociation and adsorption time of hydrogen is related to the amount of K2MoO4. 
      Generally speaking, the more K2MoO4, the faster the kinetic performance and the
      shorter the time used. According to the experimental results, the initial
      dehydrogenation temperature of MgH2 + 10 wt% K2MoO4 composite is 250 degrees C,
      which is about 110 degrees C lower than that of As-received MgH2. At 320 degrees 
      C, almost all dehydrogenation was completed within 11 min. In the temperature
      rise hydrogen absorption test, the composite system can start to absorb hydrogen 
      at about 70 degrees C. At 200 degrees C and 3 MPa hydrogen pressure, 5.5 wt% H2
      can be absorbed within 20 min. In addition, the activation energy of hydrogen
      absorption and dehydrogenation of the composite system decreased by 14.8 kJ/mol
      and 26.54 kJ/mol, respectively, compared to pure MgH2. In the cycle-stability
      test of the composite system, the hydrogen storage capacity of MgH2 can still
      reach more than 92% after the end of the 10th cycle, and the hydrogen storage
      capacity only decreases by about 0.49 wt%. The synergistic effect among the new
      species MgO, MgMo2O7, and KH generated in situ during the reaction may help to
      enhance the absorption and dissociation of H2 on the Mg/MgH2 surface and improve 
      the kinetics of MgH2 for absorption and dehydrogenation.

      Photocatalytic Water Oxidation.
LID - 2455 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nano12142455 [doi]
AB  - Developing suitable photocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is
      still a challenging issue for efficient water splitting due to the high
      requirements to create a significant impact on water splitting reaction kinetics.
      Herein, n-type Bi2WO6 with flower-like hierarchical structure and p-type Cu2O
      quantum dots (QDs) are coupled together to construct an efficient S-scheme
      heterojunction, which could enhance the migration efficiency of photogenerated
      charge carriers. The electrochemical properties are investigated to explore the
      transportation features and donor density of charge carriers in the S-scheme
      heterojunction system. Meanwhile, the as-prepared S-scheme heterojunction
      presents improved photocatalytic activity towards water oxidation in comparison
      with the sole Bi2WO6 and Cu2O QDs systems under simulated solar light
      irradiation. Moreover, the initial O2 evolution rate of the Cu2O QDs/Bi2WO6
      heterojunction system is 2.3 and 9.7 fold that of sole Bi2WO6 and Cu2O QDs
      systems, respectively.

TI  - Reversible Conversion of Odd/Even One-Way Modes in Magneto-Optical Photonic
      Crystal Double-Channel Waveguides.
LID - 2448 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nano12142448 [doi]
AB  - We have studied the transmission properties of odd/even one-way modes and their
      reversible conversion in a double-channel waveguide consisting of two
      magneto-optical photonic crystals (MOPCs) sandwiched with Al2O3 PC. There exist
      two pairs of even and odd modes, i.e., M1(even)/M2(odd) or M3(odd)/M4(even)
      modes, for the double-channel waveguides with one- or two-stranded coupling layer
      of Al2O3 rods, respectively. Among them, the M1, M2, and M3 modes are caused by
      the weak coupling strength of two sub-waveguides, while the M4 mode results from 
      the strong coupling effect and supports dispersionless slow-light propagation.
      Furthermore, we realize the reversible conversion between odd and even modes
      (i.e., between M1 and M2 modes, or M3 and M4 modes) in the one- or two-stranded
      structure, respectively, by adjusting the length and position of the perfect
      electric conductor (PEC) defect properly to cause the desired significant phase
      delay along the upper and lower equivalent transmission paths. Additionally, we
      find that the robustness of the M1 even mode is poor because of extra excitations
      of counter-propagation modes near the right Brillouin boundary, while the other
      three modes have extremely strong robustness against PEC defects and their
      one-way transmittances are nearly 100%. These results hold promise for many
      fields, such as slow-light modulation and the design of topological devices.

TI  - Preparation and Characterization of Screen-Printed Cu2S/PEDOT:PSS Hybrid Films
      for Flexible Thermoelectric Power Generator.
LID - 2430 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nano12142430 [doi]
AB  - In recent years, flexible thermoelectric generators(f-TEG), which can generate
      electricity by environmental temperature difference and have low cost, have been 
      widely concerned in self-powered energy devices for underground pipe network
      monitoring. This paper studied the Cu2S films by screen-printing. The effects of 
      different proportions of p-type Cu2S/poly 3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene-polystyrene
      sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) mixture on the thermoelectric properties of films were
      studied. The interfacial effect of the two materials, forming a superconducting
      layer on the surface of Cu2S, leads to the enhancement of film conductivity with 
      the increase of PEDOT:PSS. In addition, the Seebeck coefficient decreases with
      the increase of PEDOT:PSS due to the excessive bandgap difference between the two
      materials. When the content ratio of Cu2S and PEDOT:PSS was 1:1.2, the prepared
      film had the optimal thermoelectric performance, with a maximum power factor (PF)
      of 20.60 muW.m(-1).K(-1). The conductivity reached 75% of the initial value after
      1500 bending tests. In addition, a fully printed Te-free f-TEG with a fan-shaped 
      structure by Cu2S and Ag2Se was constructed. When the temperature difference
      (DeltaT) was 35 K, the output voltage of the f-TEG was 33.50 mV, and the maximum 
      power was 163.20 nW. Thus, it is envisaged that large thermoelectric output can
      be obtained by building a multi-layer stacking f-TEG for continuous self-powered 
      monitoring.

TI  - A Preparation Method of Nano-Pesticide Improves the Selective Toxicity toward
      Natural Enemies.
LID - 2419 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nano12142419 [doi]
AB  - Various nano-delivery systems have been designed to deliver synthetic/botanical
      pesticides for improved bioactivity. However, the enhanced toxicity of
      nanocarrier-loaded pesticides may injure the natural enemies, and their selective
      toxicity should be evaluated before the large-scale application. In this context,
      a star polymer (SPc)-based cyantraniliprole (CNAP) nano-delivery system was
      constructed, and its selective toxicity was evaluated using pest Frankliniella
      occidentalis (WFT) and predator Orius sauteri. The amide NH of CNAP could
      assemble with carbonyl groups or tertiary amines of SPc through hydrogen bonds to
      form CNAP/SPc complex spontaneously. The above self-assembly decreased the
      particle size of CNAP from 808 to 299 nm. With the help of SPc, the lethal
      concentration 50 (LC50) values of CNAP decreased from 99 to 54 mg/L and 230 to
      173 mg/L toward WFTs and O. sauteri due to the enhancement of broad-spectrum
      bioactivity. Interestingly, the toxicity selective ratio (TSR) of CNAP increased 
      from 2.33 to 3.23 with the help of SPc, revealing the higher selectivity of
      SPc-loaded CNAP. To our knowledge, it was the first successful exploration of the
      selective toxicity of nanocarrier-loaded pesticides, and the higher selective
      toxicity of SPc-loaded CNAP was beneficial for alleviating the negative impacts
      on predators.

TI  - Polarization-Induced Phase Transitions in Ultra-Thin InGaN-Based Double Quantum
      Wells.
LID - 2418 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nano12142418 [doi]
AB  - We investigate the phase transitions and the properties of the topological
      insulator in InGaN/GaN and InN/InGaN double quantum wells grown along the [0001] 
      direction. We apply a realistic model based on the nonlinear theory of elasticity
      and piezoelectricity and the eight-band k.p method with relativistic and
      nonrelativistic linear-wave-vector terms. In this approach, the effective
      spin-orbit interaction in InN is negative, which represents the worst-case
      scenario for obtaining the topological insulator in InGaN-based structures.
      Despite this rigorous assumption, we demonstrate that the topological insulator
      can occur in InGaN/GaN and InN/InGaN double quantum wells when the widths of
      individual quantum wells are two and three monolayers (MLs), and three and three 
      MLs. In these structures, when the interwell barrier is sufficiently thin, we can
      observe the topological phase transition from the normal insulator to the
      topological insulator via the Weyl semimetal, and the nontopological phase
      transition from the topological insulator to the nonlocal topological semimetal. 
      We find that in InGaN/GaN double quantum wells, the bulk energy gap in the
      topological insulator phase is much smaller for the structures with both quantum 
      well widths of 3 MLs than in the case when the quantum well widths are two and
      three MLs, whereas in InN/InGaN double quantum wells, the opposite is true. In
      InN/InGaN structures with both quantum wells being three MLs and a two ML
      interwell barrier, the bulk energy gap for the topological insulator can reach
      about 1.2&amp;nbsp;meV. We also show that the topological insulator phase rapidly
      deteriorates with increasing width of the interwell barrier due to a decrease in 
      the bulk energy gap and reduction in the window of In content between the normal 
      insulator and the nonlocal topological semimetal. For InN/InGaN double quantum
      wells with the width of the interwell barrier above five or six MLs, the
      topological insulator phase does not appear. In these structures, we find two
      novel phase transitions, namely the nontopological phase transition from the
      normal insulator to the nonlocal normal semimetal and the topological phase
      transition from the nonlocal normal semimetal to the nonlocal topological
      semimetal via the buried Weyl semimetal. These results can guide future
      investigations towards achieving a topological insulator in InGaN-based
      nanostructures.

      Cells.

LID - 10.3390/nano12142402 [doi]
AB  - Silver and copper nanoparticles (AgNPs and CuNPs) coated with stabilizing
      moieties induce oxidative stress in both bacteria and mammalian cells. Effective 
      antibacterial agents that can overcome existing mechanisms of antibacterial
      resistance will greatly improve biomedical interventions. In this study, we
      analyzed the effect of nanoparticle-induced stress. Escherichia coli and normal
      human bronchial epithelial (BEAS-2B) cells were selected for this study. The
      nanoparticle constructs tested showed low toxicity to mammalian cells except for 
      the polyvinylpyrrolidone-surface-stabilized copper nanoparticles. In fact, both
      types of copper nanoparticles used in this study induced higher levels of
      reactive oxygen species than the surface-stabilized silver nanoparticles. In
      contrast to mammalian cells, the surface-stabilized silver and copper
      nanoparticles showed varying levels of toxicity to bacteria cells. These data are
      expected to aid in bridging the knowledge gap in differential toxicities of
      silver and copper nanoparticles against bacteria and mammalian cells and will
      also improve infection interventions.

TI  - Facile and Rapid Synthesis of Porous Hydrated V2O5 Nanoflakes for
      High-Performance Zinc Ion Battery Applications.
LID - 2400 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nano12142400 [doi]
AB  - Hydrated V2O5 with unique physical and chemical characteristics has been widely
      used in various function devices, including solar cells, catalysts,
      electrochromic windows, supercapacitors, and batteries. Recently, it has
      attracted extensive attention because of the enormous potential for the
      high-performance aqueous zinc ion battery cathode. Although great progress has
      been made in developing applications of hydrated V2O5, little research focuses on
      improving current synthesis methods, which have disadvantages of massive energy
      consumption, tedious reaction time, and/or low efficiency. Herein, an improved
      synthesis method is developed for hydrated V2O5 nanoflakes according to the
      phenomenon that the reactions between V2O5 and peroxide can be dramatically
      accelerated with low-temperature heating. Porous hydrated V2O5 nanoflake gel was 
      obtained from cheap raw materials at 40 degrees C in 30 min. It shows a high
      specific capacity, of 346.6 mAh/g, at 0.1 A/g; retains 55.2% of that at 20 A/g;
      and retains a specific capacity of 221.0 mAh/g after 1800 charging/discharging
      cycles at 1 A/g as an aqueous zinc ion battery cathode material. This work
      provides a highly facile and rapid synthesis method for hydrated V2O5, which may 
      favor its applications in energy storage and other functional devices.

TI  - Pulmonary Toxicity of Silica Linked to Its Micro- or Nanometric Particle Size and
      Crystal Structure: A Review.
LID - 2392 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nano12142392 [doi]
AB  - Silicon dioxide (SiO2) is a mineral compound present in the Earth's crust in two 
      mineral forms: crystalline and amorphous. Based on epidemiological and/or
      biological evidence, the pulmonary effects of crystalline silica are considered
      well understood, with the development of silicosis, emphysema, chronic
      bronchitis, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The structure and capacity 
      to trigger oxidative stress are recognized as relevant determinants in
      crystalline silica's toxicity. In contrast, natural amorphous silica was long
      considered nontoxic, and was often used as a negative control in experimental
      studies. However, as manufactured amorphous silica nanoparticles (or nanosilica
      or SiNP) are becoming widely used in industrial applications, these paradigms
      must now be reconsidered at the nanoscale (&lt;100 nm). Indeed, recent
      experimental studies appear to point towards significant toxicity of manufactured
      amorphous silica nanoparticles similar to that of micrometric crystalline silica.
      In this article, we present an extensive review of the nontumoral pulmonary
      effects of silica based on in vitro and in vivo experimental studies. The
      findings of this review are presented both for micro- and nanoscale particles,
      but also based on the crystalline structure of the silica particles.

TI  - Testing an Iron Oxide Nanoparticle-Based Method for Magnetic Separation of
      Nanoplastics and Microplastics from Water.
LID - 2348 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nano12142348 [doi]
AB  - Nanoplastic pollution is increasing worldwide and poses a threat to humans,
      animals, and ecological systems. High-throughput, reliable methods for the
      isolation and separation of NMPs from drinking water, wastewater, or
      environmental bodies of water are of interest. We investigated iron oxide
      nanoparticles (IONPs) with hydrophobic coatings to magnetize plastic particulate 
      waste for removal. We produced and tested IONPs synthesized using air-free
      conditions and in atmospheric air, coated with several polydimethylsiloxane
      (PDMS)-based hydrophobic coatings. Particles were characterized with scanning
      electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM),
      superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometry, dynamic light
      scattering (DLS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and zeta potential. The IONPs
      synthesized in air contained a higher percentage of the magnetic spinel phase and
      stronger magnetization. Binding and recovery of NMPs from both salt and
      freshwater samples was demonstrated. Specifically, we were able to remove 100% of
      particles in a range of sizes, from 2-5 mm, and nearly 90% of nanoplastic
      particles with a size range from 100 nm to 1000 nm using a simple 2-inch
      permanent NdFeB magnet. Magnetization of NMPs using IONPs is a viable method for 
      separation from water samples for quantification, characterization, and
      purification and remediation of water.

      layer. In this paper, we report a new compound featuring a D-A-D structure,
      9,9'-(pyrimidine-2,5-diylbis(2,1-phenylene))bis(3,6-di-tert-butyl-9H-carbazole)
      (PDPC). A nondoped OLED using this compound as a single emitter exhibits unique
      voltage-dependent dual emission. The emission colors range from blue to
      orange-red with an increase in voltage, during which white electroluminescence
      with a Commission Internationale De L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinate of (0.35, 0.29) 
      and a color render index (CRI) value of 93 was observed. A comparative study
      revealed that the dual emission simultaneously originates from the monomers and
      excimers of the emitter. This study provides insight into understanding the
      multimer-excited mechanism and developing novel color-tunable OLEDs.

AB  - Antimony (Sb) demonstrates ascendant reactive activation with lithium ions thanks
      to its distinctive puckered layer structure. Compared with graphite, Sb can reach
      a considerable theoretical specific capacity of 660 mAh g(-1) by constituting
      Li3Sb safer reaction potential. Hereupon, with a self-supported organic carbon as
      a three-dimensional polymer network structure, Sb/carbon (3DPNS-Sb/C) composites 
      were produced through a hydrothermal reaction channel followed by a heat disposal
      operation. The unique structure shows uniformitarian Sb nanoparticles wrapped in 
      a self-supported organic carbon, alleviating the volume extension of innermost Sb
      alloying, and conducive to the integrality of the construction. When used as
      anodes for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), 3DPNS-Sb/C exhibits a high invertible
      specific capacity of 511.5 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 0.5 A g(-1) after
      100 cycles and a remarkable rate property of 289.5 mAh g(-1) at a current density
      of 10 A g(-1). As anodes, LIBs demonstrate exceptional electrochemical
      performance.

LID - 10.3390/molecules27144589 [doi]
AB  - The separation of chemical components from wild plants to develop new pesticides 
      is a hot topic in current research. To evaluate the antimicrobial effects of
      metabolites of Ligusticum&amp;nbsp;chuanxiong (CX), we systematically studied the
      antimicrobial activity of extracts of CX, and the active compounds were isolated,
      purified and structurally identified. The results of toxicity measurement showed 
      that the extracts of CX had good biological activities against Botrytis cinerea, 
      Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, Alternaria alternata and Pythium aphanidermatum, and
      the value of EC50 were 130.95, 242.36, 332.73 and 307.29 mg/L, respectively. The 
      results of in vivo determination showed that under the concentration of 1000
      mg/L, the control effect of CX extract on Blumeria graminis was more than 40%,
      and the control effect on Botrytis cinerea was 100%. The antifungal active
      components of CX were identified as Senkyunolide A and Ligustilide by mass
      spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance. The MIC (minimum inhibitory
      concentration) value of Senkyunolide A and Ligustilide against Fusarium
      graminearum were 7.81 and 62.25 mg/L, respectively. As a new botanical fungicide 
      with a brightly exploitative prospect, CX extract has potential research value in
      the prevention and control of plant diseases.

TI  - Lights and Shadows on the Therapeutic Use of Antimicrobial Peptides.
LID - 4584 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27144584 [doi]
AB  - The emergence of antimicrobial-resistant infections is still a major concern for 
      public health worldwide. The number of pathogenic microorganisms capable of
      resisting common therapeutic treatments are constantly increasing, highlighting
      the need of innovative and more effective drugs. This phenomenon is strictly
      connected to the rapid metabolism of microorganisms: due to the huge number of
      mutations that can occur in a relatively short time, a colony can "adapt" to the 
      pharmacological treatment with the evolution of new resistant species. However,
      the shortage of available antimicrobial drugs in clinical use is also caused by
      the high costs involved in developing and marketing new drugs without an adequate
      guarantee of an economic return; therefore, the pharmaceutical companies have
      reduced their investments in this area. The use of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) 
      represents a promising strategy for the design of new therapeutic agents. AMPs
      act as immune defense mediators of the host organism and show a poor ability to
      induce antimicrobial resistance, coupled with other advantages such as a broad
      spectrum of activity, not excessive synthetic costs and low toxicity of both the 
      peptide itself and its own metabolites. It is also important to underline that
      many antimicrobial peptides, due to their inclination to attack cell membranes,
      have additional biological activities, such as, for example, as anti-cancer
      drugs. Unfortunately, they usually undergo rapid degradation by proteolytic
      enzymes and are characterized by poor bioavailability, preventing their extensive
      clinical use and landing on the pharmaceutical market. This review is focused on 
      the strength and weak points of antimicrobial peptides as therapeutic agents. We 
      give an overview on the AMPs already employed in clinical practice, which are
      examples of successful strategies aimed at overcoming the main drawbacks of
      peptide-based drugs. The review deepens the most promising strategies to design
      modified antimicrobial peptides with higher proteolytic stability with the
      purpose of giving a comprehensive summary of the commonly employed approaches to 
      evaluate and optimize the peptide potentialities.

TI  - Electrochemical Immunoassay for Tumor Marker CA19-9 Detection Based on
      Self-Assembled Monolayer.
LID - 4578 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27144578 [doi]
AB  - A CA19-9 electrochemical immunosensor was constructed using a hybrid
      self-assembled membrane modified with a gold electrode and applied to detect real
      samples. Hybrid self-assembled membranes were selected for electrode modification
      and used to detect antigens. First, the pretreated working electrodes were placed
      in a 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA)/beta-mercaptoethanol (ME) mixture for 24 h
      for self-assembly. The electrodes were then placed in an EDC/NHS mixture for 1 h.
      Layer modification was performed by stepwise dropwise addition of CA19-9
      antibody, BSA, and antigen. Differential pulse voltammetry was used to
      characterize this immunosensor preparation process. The assembled electrochemical
      immunosensor enables linear detection in the concentration range of 0.05-500 U/mL
      of CA19-9, and the detection limit was calculated as 0.01 U/mL. The results of
      the specificity measurement test showed that the signal change of the interfering
      substance was much lower than the response value of the detected antigen,
      indicating that the sensor has good specificity and strong anti-interference
      ability. The repeatability test results showed that the relative standard
      deviations were less than 5%, showing good accuracy and precision. The CA19-9
      electrochemical immunosensor was used for the actual sample detection, and the
      experimental results of the standard serum addition method showed that the RSD
      values of the test concentrations were all less than 10%. The recoveries were
      102.4-115.0%, indicating that the assay has high precision, good accuracy, and

TI  - Enhancing the Activity of Carboxymethyl Cellulase Enzyme Using Highly Stable
      Selenium Nanoparticles Biosynthesized by Bacillus paralicheniformis Y4.
LID - 4585 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27144585 [doi]
AB  - The inorganic selenium is absorbed and utilized inefficiently, and the range
      between toxicity and demand is narrow, so the application is strictly limited.
      Selenium nanoparticles have higher bioactivity and biosafety properties,
      including increased antioxidant and anticancer properties. Thus, producing and
      applying eco-friendly, non-toxic selenium nanoparticles in feed additives is
      crucial. Bacillus paralicheniformis Y4 was investigated for its potential ability
      to produce selenium nanoparticles and the activity of carboxymethyl cellulases.
      The selenium nanoparticles were characterized using zeta potential analyses,
      Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy 
      (SEM). Additionally, evaluations of the anti-alpha-glucosidase activity and the
      antioxidant activity of the selenium nanoparticles and the ethyl acetate extracts
      of Y4 were conducted. B. paralicheniformis Y4 exhibited high selenite tolerance
      of 400 mM and the selenium nanoparticles had an average particle size of 80 nm
      with a zeta potential value of -35.8 mV at a pH of 7.0, suggesting that the
      particles are relatively stable against aggregation. After 72 h of incubation
      with 5 mM selenite, B. paralicheniformis Y4 was able to reduce it by 76.4%,
      yielding red spherical bio-derived selenium nanoparticles and increasing the
      carboxymethyl cellulase activity by 1.49 times to 8.96 U/mL. For the first time, 
      this study reports that the carboxymethyl cellulase activity of Bacillus
      paralicheniforis was greatly enhanced by selenite. The results also indicated
      that B. paralicheniformis Y4 could be capable of ecologically removing selenite
      from contaminated sites and has great potential for producing selenium
      nanoparticles as feed additives to enhance the added value of agricultural
      products.

TI  - Antiviral Activity of Porcine IFN-lambda3 and IFN-alpha against Porcine Rotavirus
      In Vitro.
LID - 4575 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27144575 [doi]
AB  - Interferons (IFNs) play a major role in the host's antiviral innate immunity. In 
      response to viral infection, IFNs bind their receptors and initiate a signaling
      cascade, leading to the accurate transcriptional regulation of hundreds of
      IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Porcine rotavirus (PoRV) belongs to genus Rotavirus 
      of the Reoviridae family; the infection is a global epidemic disease and a major 
      threat to the pig industry. In this study, we found that IFN-lambda3 inhibited
      the replication of PoRV in both MA104 cells and IPEC-J2 cells, and this
      inhibition was dose-dependent. Furthermore, the antiviral activity of IFN-lambda3
      was more potent in IPEC-J2 cells than in MA104 cells. Further research showed
      that IFN-lambda3 and IFN-alpha might inhibit PoRV infection by activating ISGs,
      i.e., MxA, OASL and ISG15, in IPEC-J2 cells. However, the co-treatment of
      IFN-lambda3 and IFN-alpha did not enhance the antiviral activity. Our data
      demonstrated that IFN-lambda3 had antiviral activity against PoRV and may serve
      as a useful antiviral candidate against PoRV, as well as other viruses in swine.

LID - 10.3390/molecules27144528 [doi]
AB  - As a valuable medicinal herb and spice, agarwood is widely used in the fields of 
      daily chemistry, traditional medicine, religion and literary collection. It
      mainly contains sesquiterpenes and 2-(2-phenylethyl)chromones, which are often
      used to soothe the body and mind, relieve anxiety, act as an antidepressant and
      treat insomnia and other mental disorders, presenting a good calming effect. This
      paper reviews the chemical composition of the essential oils of different sources
      of agarwood, as well as the progress of research on the sedative and
      tranquilizing pharmacological activity and mechanism of action of agarwood
      essential oil (AEO), and then analyzes the current problems of AEO research and
      its application prospects in the treatment of mental diseases.

AB  - The present study investigated the wound healing activity of Moringa oleifera
      leaf extract on an infected excision wound model in rats. Infection was induced
      using methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa. An investigation was also done to study the effect of Moringa extract
      on the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and transforming growth
      factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta1) gene expression in vitro using human keratinocytes
      (HaCaT). The methanol extract of M. oleifera leaves was analyzed for the presence
      of phytochemicals by LCMS. The antimicrobial activity of the extract was also
      determined. Wound contraction, days for epithelization, antioxidant enzyme
      activities, epidermal height, angiogenesis, and collagen deposition were studied.
      M. oleifera showed an antimicrobial effect and significantly improved wound
      contraction, reduced epithelization period, increased antioxidant enzymes
      activity, and reduced capillary density. Effect of the extract was less in wounds
      infected with P. aeruginosa when compared to MRSA. The VEGF and TGF-beta1 gene
      expression was increased by M. oleifera.

TI  - Prediction of pH Value of Aqueous Acidic and Basic Deep Eutectic Solvent Using
      COSMO-RS sigma Profiles' Molecular Descriptors.
LID - 4489 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27144489 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this work was to develop a simple and easy-to-apply model to predict
      the pH values of deep eutectic solvents (DESs) over a wide range of pH values
      that can be used in daily work. For this purpose, the pH values of 38 different
      DESs were measured (ranging from 0.36 to 9.31) and mathematically interpreted. To
      develop mathematical models, DESs were first numerically described using sigma
      profiles generated with the COSMOtherm software. After the DESs' description, the
      following models were used: (i) multiple linear regression (MLR), (ii) piecewise 
      linear regression (PLR), and (iii) artificial neural networks (ANNs) to link the 
      experimental values with the descriptors. Both PLR and ANN were found to be
      applicable to predict the pH values of DESs with a very high goodness of fit
      (R(2)independent validation &gt; 0.8600). Due to the good mathematical
      correlation of the experimental and predicted values, the sigma profile generated
      with COSMOtherm could be used as a DES molecular descriptor for the prediction of
      their pH values.

TI  - Antifeedant Mechanism of Dodonaea viscosa Saponin A Isolated from the Seeds of
      Dodonaea viscosa.
LID - 4464 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27144464 [doi]
AB  - Dodonaea viscosa is a medicinal plant which has been used to treat various
      diseases in humans. However, the anti-insect activity of extracts from D. viscosa
      has not been evaluated. Here, we found that the total saponins from D. viscosa
      (TSDV) had strong antifeedant and growth inhibition activities against 4th-instar
      larvae of Spodoptera litura. The median antifeeding concentration (AFC50) value
      of TSDV on larvae was 1621.81 mug/mL. TSDV affected the detoxification enzyme
      system of the larvae and also exerted antifeedant activity possibly through
      targeting the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system. The AFC50 concentration, the
      carboxylesterase activity, glutathione S-transferases activity, and cytochrome
      P450 content increased to 258%, 205%, and 215%, respectively, and likewise the
      glutamate decarboxylase activity and GABA content to 195% and 230%, respectively,
      in larvae which fed on TSDV. However, D. viscosa saponin A (DVSA) showed better
      antifeedant activity and growth inhibition activity in larvae, compared to TSDV. 
      DVSA also exerted their antifeedant activity possibly through targeting the GABA 
      system and subsequently affected the detoxification enzyme system. Further, DVSA 
      directly affected the medial sensillum and the lateral sensillum of the
      4th-instar larvae. Stimulation of Spodoptera litura. with DVSA elicited clear,
      consistent, and robust excitatory responses in a single taste cell.

TI  - A Novel Based-Network Strategy to Identify Phytochemicals from Radix Salviae
      Miltiorrhizae (Danshen) for Treating Alzheimer's Disease.
LID - 4463 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27144463 [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common age-related neurodegenerative disease that
      strikes millions worldwide. Herein, we demonstrate a new approach based on
      network target to identify anti-AD compounds from Danshen. Network pharmacology
      and molecular docking were employed to establish the DS-AD network, which mainly 
      involved apoptosis of neuron cells. Then network scoring was confirmed via
      Connectivity Map analysis. M308 (Danshenxinkun D) was an anti-AD candidate with a
      high score (p &lt; 0.01). Furthermore, we conducted ex vivo experiments with
      H2O2-treated PC12 cells to verify the neuroprotective effect of Salvia
      miltiorrhiza-containing plasma (SMP), and UPLC-Q-TOF/MS and RT-qPCR were
      performed to demonstrate the anti-AD activity of M308 from SMP. Results revealed 
      that SMP could enhance cell viability and level of acetylcholine. AO/EB staining 
      and Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) analysis showed that SMP significantly
      suppressed apoptosis, which may be due to anti-oxidative stress activity.
      Moreover, the effects of M308 and SMP on expressions of PSEN1, DRD2, and APP mRNA
      were consistent, and M308 can significantly reverse the expression of PSEN1 and
      DRD2 mRNA in H2O2-treated PC12 cells. The strategy based on the network could be 
      employed to identify anti-AD compounds from Chinese herbs. Notably, M308 stands
      out as a promising anti-AD candidate for development.

TI  - The Influence of Tyrosol-Enriched Rhodiola sachalinensis Extracts Bioconverted by
      the Mycelium of Bovista plumbe on Scopolamine-Induced Cognitive, Behavioral, and 
      Physiological Responses in Mice.
LID - 4455 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27144455 [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder
      characterized by cognitive deficits, which are accompanied by memory loss and
      cognitive disruption. Rhodiola sachalinensis (RSE) is a medicinal plant that has 
      been used in northeastern Asia for various pharmacological activities. We
      attempted to carry out the bioconversion of RSE (Bio-RSE) using the mycelium of
      Bovista plumbe to obtain tyrosol-enriched Bio-RSE. The objective of this study
      was to investigate the effects of Bio-RSE on the activation of the cholinergic
      system and the inhibition of oxidative stress in mice with scopolamine
      (Sco)-induced memory impairment. Sco (1 mg/kg body weight, i.p.) impaired the
      mice's performance on the Y-maze test, passive avoidance test, and water maze
      test. However, the number of abnormal behaviors was reduced in the groups
      supplemented with Bio-RSE. Bio-RSE treatment improved working memory and
      avoidance times against electronic shock, increased step-through latency, and
      reduced the time to reach the escape zone in the water maze test. Bio-RSE
      dramatically improved the cholinergic system by decreasing acetylcholinesterase
      activity and regulated oxidative stress by increasing antioxidant enzymes
      (superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT)). The reduction in nuclear factor 
      erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) signaling in the
      brain tissue due to scopolamine was restored by the administration of Bio-RSE.
      Bio-RSE also significantly decreased amyloid-beta 1-42 (Abeta1-42) and amyloid
      precursor protein (APP) expression. Moreover, the increased malondialdehyde (MDA)
      level and low total antioxidant capacity in Sco-treated mouse brains were
      reversed by Bio-RSE, and an increase in Nrf2 and HO-1 was also observed. In
      conclusion, Bio-RSE protected against Sco-induced cognitive impairment by
      activating Nrf2/HO-1 signaling and may be developed as a potential beneficial
      material for AD.

LID - 10.3390/molecules27144427 [doi]
AB  - Cholesteric liquid crystal (ChLC) materials with broadband reflection are
      witnessing a significant surge in interest due to their unique ability to
      self-organize into a helical supra-molecular architecture and their excellent
      selective reflection of light based on the Bragg relationship. Nowadays, by the
      virtue of building self-organized nanostructures with pitch gradient or
      non-uniform pitch distribution, extensive work has already been performed to
      obtain ChLC films with a broad reflection band. This critical review
      systematically summarizes the optical background of the ChLCs with broadband
      reflection characteristics, methods to obtain broadband reflection of ChLCs, as
      well as the application in this area. Combined with the research status and the
      advantages in the field, the challenges and opportunities of applied scientific
      problems in the research direction are also introduced.

LID - 10.3390/molecules27144422 [doi]
AB  - Wolfberry (Lycium barbarum L.) is a nutritious and medicinal fruit, and deeply
      processed products of wolfberry needs to be improved. In this study, nutrition,
      bioactive compounds, and hepaprotective activity were explored in wolfberry
      vinegar (WFV). The contents of nutrients including total sugar and protein in WFV
      samples were 2.46 and 0.27 g/100 mL, respectively. Total phenolic and flavonoid
      contents in WFV were 2.42 mg GAE/mL and 1.67 mg RE/mL, respectively.
      p-Hydroxybenzoic acid and m-hydroxycinnamic acid were the main polyphenols in
      WFV. The antioxidant activity of WFV were 20.176 mM Trolox/L (ABTS), 8.614 mM
      Trolox/L (FRAP), and 26.736 mM Trolox/L (DPPH), respectively. In addition, WFV
      treatment effectively alleviated liver injury by improving histopathological
      changes and reducing liver biochemical indexes in CCl4-treated mice. WFV
      alleviated oxidative damage by inhibiting oxidative levels and increasing
      antioxidant levels. These results suggest that WFV can be utilized as a
      functional food to prevent oxidative liver injury.

TI  - Recent Advances in Self-Assembly and Application of Para-Aramids.
LID - 4413 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27144413 [doi]
AB  - Poly(p-phenylene terephthalamide) (PPTA) is one kind of lyotropic liquid crystal 
      polymer. Kevlar fibers performed from PPTA are widely used in many fields due to 
      their superior mechanical properties resulting from their highly oriented
      macromolecular structure. However, the "infusible and insoluble" characteristic
      of PPTA gives rise to its poor processability, which limits its scope of
      application. The strong interactions and orientation characteristic of aromatic
      amide segments make PPTA attractive in the field of self-assembly. Chemical
      derivation has proved an effective way to modify the molecular structure of PPTA 
      to improve its solubility and amphiphilicity, which resulted in different liquid 
      crystal behaviors or supramolecular aggregates, but the modification of PPTA is
      usually complex and difficult. Alternatively, higher-order all-PPTA structures
      have also been realized through the controllable hierarchical self-assembly of
      PPTA from the polymerization process to the formation of macroscopic products.
      This review briefly summarizes the self-assembly methods of PPTA-based materials 
      in recent years, and focuses on the polymerization-induced PPTA nanofibers which 
      can be further fabricated into different macroscopic architectures when other
      self-assembly methods are combined. This monomer-started hierarchical
      self-assembly strategy evokes the feasible processing of PPTA, and enriches the
      diversity of product, which is expected to be expanded to other liquid crystal
      polymers.

TI  - An Integrated Study on the Fading Mechanism of Malachite Green Industrial Dye for
      the Marquisette Curtain in the Studio of Cleansing Fragrance, the Palace Museum
      (Beijing).
LID - 4411 [pii]

AB  - Historical marquisette curtains were composed of lightweight fabrics, woven in an
      open-mesh and leno-type weave, usually made of silk, and found in Qing imperial
      buildings. As panel curtains, they were exposed to light, and so underwent
      fading. This study investigated the manufacturing technology and fading mechanism
      of dyed marquisette fabric from the Studio of Cleansing Fragrance, the Palace
      Museum (Beijing). The technological aspects were identified. The types of weave, 
      fiber, and adhesive used to fix the curtain to the wooden frame were identified
      through microscopic observation and infrared spectroscopy. A color change
      characterization was performed based on UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra.
      The textile colorant was identified as malachite green (MG), and its degradation 
      by light was subsequently studied by dynamic photolysis experiments in a kinetic 
      solution for the rapid exploration of by-products. The main degradation pathways 
      were thus identified and the factors responsible for the induced color changes
      were discussed. A comparison of the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry
      (LC-MS) results of the products derived from the photolysis method as well as of 
      the samples extracted from the object allowed for the identification of the
      presence of different degradation pathways in the faded and unfaded parts of the 
      textile. A metabolomics analysis was applied to account for the differences in
      the degradation pathways.

TI  - MoO3 Nanobelt-Modified HMCM-49 Zeolite with Enhanced Dispersion of Mo Species and
      Catalytic Performance for Methane Dehydro-Aromatization.
LID - 4404 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27144404 [doi]
AB  - The methane dehydro-aromatization reaction (MDA) is a promising methane
      valorization process due to the conversion of methane to value-added aromatics
      (benzene, toluene and naphthalene). However, one of the major disadvantages of
      utilizing zeolite in MDA is that the catalyst is rapidly inactivated due to coke 
      formation, which eventually causes the activity and aromatic selectivity to
      decrease. Consequently, the process is not conducive to large-scale industrial
      applications. The reasonable control of Mo site distribution on the zeolite
      surface is the key factor for partially inhibiting the coking of the catalyst and
      improving stability. Here, MoO3 nanobelts can be used for alternative Mo
      precursors to prepare MDA catalysts. Catalysts modified with MoO3 nanobelts
      present higher activity (13.4%) and benzene yield (9.2%) than those catalysts
      loaded with commercial MoO3.

LID - 4402 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27144402 [doi]
AB  - Soluble sulfur (S8) and insoluble sulfur (IS) have different application fields, 
      and molecular dynamics simulation can reveal their differences in solubility in
      solvents. It is found that in the simulated carbon disulfide (CS2) solvent,
      soluble sulfur in the form of clusters mainly promotes the dissolution of
      clusters through van der Waals interaction between solvent molecules (CS2) and
      S8, and the solubility gradually increases with the increase in temperature.
      However, the strong interaction between polymer chains of insoluble sulfur in the
      form of polymer hinders the diffusion of IS into CS2 solvent, which is not
      conducive to high-temperature dissolution. The simulated solubility parameter
      shows that the solubility parameter of soluble sulfur is closer to that of the
      solvent, which is consistent with the above explanation that soluble sulfur is
      easy to dissolve.

TI  - The Expression Profiles of the Salvia
      miltiorrhiza&amp;nbsp;3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A Reductase 4 Gene and 
      Its Influence on the Biosynthesis of Tanshinones.
LID - 4354 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27144354 [doi]
AB  - Salvia miltiorrhiza is a medicinal plant that synthesises biologically-active
      tanshinones with numerous therapeutic properties. An important rate-limiting
      enzyme in the biosynthesis of their precursors is
      3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGR). This study presents the
      organ-specific expression profile of the S. miltiorrhiza HMGR4 gene and its
      sensitivity to potential regulators, viz. gibberellic acid (GA3), indole-3-acetic
      acid (IAA) and salicylic acid (SA). In addition, it demonstrates the importance
      of the HMGR4 gene, the hormone used, the plant organ, and the culture environment
      for the biosynthesis of tanshinones. HMGR4 overexpression was found to
      significantly boost the accumulation of dihydrotanshinone I (DHTI),
      cryptotanshinone (CT), tanshinone I (TI) and tanshinone IIA (TIIA) in roots by
      0.44 to 5.39 mg/g dry weight (DW), as well as TIIA in stems and leaves. S.
      miltiorrhiza roots cultivated in soil demonstrated higher concentrations of the
      examined metabolites than those grown in vitro. GA3 caused a considerable
      increase in the quantity of CT (by 794.2 microg/g DW) and TIIA (by 88.1 microg/g 
      DW) in roots. In turn, IAA significantly inhibited the biosynthesis of the
      studied tanshinones in root material.

TI  - Membrane Permeabilization and Antimicrobial Activity of Recombinant Defensin-d2
      and Actifensin against Multidrug-Resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida
      albicans.
LID - 4325 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27144325 [doi]
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance requires urgent efforts towards the discovery of active 
      antimicrobials, and the development of strategies to sustainably produce them.
      Defensin and defensin-like antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are increasingly gaining
      pharmacological interest because of their potency against pathogens. In this
      study, we expressed two AMPs: defensin-d2 derived from spinach, and defensin-like
      actifensin from Actinomyces ruminicola. Recombinant pTXB1 plasmids carrying the
      target genes encoding defensin-d2 and actifensin were generated by the MEGAWHOP
      cloning strategy. Each AMP was first expressed as a fusion protein in Escherichia
      coli, purified by affinity chromatography, and was thereafter assayed for
      antimicrobial activity against multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens. Approximately
      985 microg/mL and 2895 microg/mL of recombinant defensin-d2 and actifensin,
      respectively, were recovered with high purity. An analysis by MALDI-TOF MS showed
      distinct peaks corresponding to molecular weights of approximately 4.1 kDa for
      actifensin and 5.8 kDa for defensin-d2. An in vitro antimicrobial assay showed
      that MDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans were inhibited at minimum
      concentrations of 7.5 microg/mL and 23 microg/mL for recombinant defensin-d2 and 
      actifensin, respectively. The inhibitory kinetics of the peptides revealed cidal 
      activity within 4 h of the contact time. Furthermore, both peptides exhibited an 
      antagonistic interaction, which could be attributed to their affinities for
      similar ligands, as deduced by peptide-ligand profiling. Moreover, both peptides 
      inhibited biofilm formation, and they exhibited no resistance potential and low
      hemolytic activity. The peptides also possess the ability to permeate and disrupt
      the cell membranes of MDR P. aeruginosa and C. albicans. Therefore, recombinant
      actifensin and defensin-d2 exhibit broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity and have
      the potential to be used as therapy against MDR pathogens.

TI  - Yeast Diversity during Spontaneous Fermentations and Oenological Characterisation
      of Indigenous Saccharomyces cerevisiae for Potential as Wine Starter Cultures.
LID - 1455 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms10071455 [doi]
AB  - Diversity of regional yeast can be influenced by geography, grape cultivars and
      the use of SO2, but at single vineyard scale in China, the impact of these
      factors on yeast population, particularly Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is not well
      studied. Here, we characterised yeast species and dynamics during spontaneous
      fermentations with/without SO2 using eight typical grape cultivars from Yuma
      vineyard in Ningxia wine region of China. Results show that distribution and
      abundance of yeast species varied by grape varieties, fermentation stage and SO2 
      treatment. A number of 290 S. cerevisiae isolates were further classified into 33
      genotypes by Interdelta fingerprinting. A prevailing role of grape varieties in
      shaping the genetic divergence of S. cerevisiae in Yuma vineyard was observed, as
      compared to the impacts of fermentation stage and SO2 treatment. Pre-selected S. 
      cerevisiae strains were subjected to vinification with Cabernet Sauvignon and
      Chardonnay. All strains completed fermentations but the physiochemical parameters
      and volatile profiles of wines were strain-specific. Some indigenous S.
      cerevisiae yielded more desirable aroma compounds compared to the commercial
      strains, among which NX16 and NX18 outcompeted others, therefore having potential
      for use as starters. This study provides comprehensive analysis on yeast
      diversity at vineyard scale in Ningxia. Information on the vinification using
      indigenous S. cerevisiae is of great value for improving Ningxia wine
      regionality.

TI  - Evaluation of Intestinal Microbial Metabolites in Preterm Infants with Different 
      Initial Feeding Methods by In Vitro Fermentation Modeling System.
LID - 1453 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms10071453 [doi]
AB  - We aim to explore the intestinal microbial metabolites in preterm infants with
      noninvasive methods and analyze the effects of initial feeding methods. Preterm
      infants with gestational weeks lower than 34 were recruited for fecal sample
      collection every 7 days. Fecal pH, ammonia, bile acid, and secretory IgA (sIgA)
      were tested. A 1:10 fecal slurry was inoculated into different culture media
      containing different carbohydrates as the only carbon source: lactose (LAT),
      fructooligosaccharide (FOS), galactooligosaccharide (GOS), and 2'-fucosyllactose 
      (FL2). After 24 h of anaerobic culture through an in vitro fermentation system,
      air pressure difference, carbohydrate degradation rate, and short-chain fatty
      acids (SCFAs) content in fermentation pots were measured. Preterm infants were
      assigned into two groups: group A, preterm infants fed by human milk, including
      mother's own milk and donor human milk (DHM); group B, preterm infants fed by
      preterm formula at first 3 days and fed by human milk (including mother's own
      milk and DHM) from day 4 to discharge. Group A included 90 samples and group B
      included 70 samples. Group A had lower fecal pH (p = 0.023), ammonia (p = 0.001),
      and bile acids (p = 0.025). Group B also had higher fecal sIgA levels, both in OD
      (p = 0.046) and concentration (p &lt; 0.0001) methods. Carbohydrates degradation 
      rates in group A were higher than group B, especially in LAT medium (p = 0.017)
      and GOS medium (p = 0.005). Gas production amount had no significant difference
      in all four media. Several different SCFAs in four kinds of different culture
      media in group A were higher than in group B, but valeric acid was lower in group
      A. The initial feeding methods may affect the preterm infants' intestinal
      microecology and microbial metabolites for at least several weeks.

LID - 10.3390/microorganisms10071412 [doi]
AB  - Psittacine birds are commonly kept as companion birds and the maintenance of
      these birds in captivity may represent a zoonotic risk and contribute to the
      propagation of multidrug-resistant and beta-lactamase extended-spectrum
      (ESBLs)-producing pathogens. This study aimed to identify and characterize
      strains of the Klebsiella&amp;nbsp;pneumoniae complex isolated from diseased
      psittacine birds, determining virulence and resistance profiles. K. pneumoniae
      strains were isolated from 16 birds (16/46). All strains carried more than three 
      virulence genes, with a high frequency of fimH and kpn (93.75%), uge (87.52%),
      and irp-2 (81.25%) genes. The antimicrobial susceptibility revealed that 3/16
      strains were ESBL producers. Genomic analysis revealed that CTX-M-15-positive
      strains belonged to sequence types (STs) ST15, ST147, and ST307, characterized as
      international clones associated with outbreaks of healthcare-associated
      infections (HAIs) worldwide.

TI  - Comparative Genomic Analysis of the Marine Cyanobacterium
      Acaryochloris&amp;nbsp;marina MBIC10699 Reveals the Impact of Phycobiliprotein
      Reacquisition and the Diversity of Acaryochloris Plasmids.
LID - 1374 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms10071374 [doi]
AB  - Acaryochloris is a marine cyanobacterium that synthesizes chlorophyll d, a unique
      chlorophyll that absorbs far-red lights. Acaryochloris is also characterized by
      the loss of phycobiliprotein (PBP), a photosynthetic antenna specific to
      cyanobacteria; however, only the type-strain A. marina MBIC11017 retains PBP,
      suggesting that PBP-related genes were reacquired through horizontal gene
      transfer (HGT). Acaryochloris is thought to have adapted to various environments 
      through its huge genome size and the genes acquired through HGT; however, genomic
      information on Acaryochloris is limited. In this study, we report the complete
      genome sequence of A.&amp;nbsp;marina MBIC10699, which was isolated from the same
      area of ocean as A. marina MBIC11017 as a PBP-less strain. The genome of A.marina
      MBIC10699 consists of a 6.4 Mb chromosome and four large plasmids totaling about 
      7.6 Mb, and the phylogenic analysis shows that A.marina MBIC10699 is the most
      closely related to A. marina MBIC11017 among the Acaryochloris species reported
      so far. Compared with A. marina MBIC11017, the chromosomal genes are highly
      conserved between them, while the genes encoded in the plasmids are significantly
      diverse. Comparing these genomes provides clues as to how the genes for PBPs were
      reacquired and what changes occurred in the genes for photosystems during
      evolution.

TI  - Prevalence and Characterization of Extended-Spectrum beta-Lactamase- and
      Carbapenemase-Producing Enterobacterales from Tunisian Seafood.
LID - 1364 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms10071364 [doi]
AB  - Aquaculture is a rapidly expanding sector in which it is important to monitor the
      occurrence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria. The presence of
      extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL-) or carbapenemase-producing
      Enterobacterales is a commonly used indicator of the resistance burden in a given
      sector. In this study, 641 pieces of farmed fish (sea bream and sea bass), as
      well as 1075 Mediterranean clams, were analyzed. All ESBL- and
      carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales collected were whole-genome sequenced.
      The proportion of ESBL-producing Enterobacterales was 1.4% in fish and 1.6% in
      clams, carried by Escherichia coli (n = 23) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 4).
      The ESBL phenotype was exclusively due to the presence of blaCTX-M genes, the
      most frequent one being blaCTX-M-15. The blaCTX-M-1 gene was also identified in
      six E. coli, among which four were carried by IncI1/pST3 plasmids, possibly
      betraying an animal origin. Carbapenemases were absent in fish but identified in 
      two K. pneumoniae isolates from clams (blaNDM-1 and blaOXA-48). Several sequence 
      types (STs) identified were associated with human MDR clones such as E. coli
      ST131 and ST617, or K. pneumoniae ST307 and ST147. Our results might indicate
      that bacteria from hospital or farm effluents can reach the open sea and
      contaminate seafood and fish that are living or raised nearby. Therefore,
      monitoring the quality of water discharged to the sea and the presence of MDR
      bacteria in seafood is mandatory to ensure the quality of fishery products.

TI  - Bacterial Metabolic Potential in Response to Climate Warming Alters the
      Decomposition Process of Aquatic Plant Litter-In Shallow Lake Mesocosms.
LID - 1327 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms10071327 [doi]
AB  - Increased decomposition rates in shallow lakes with global warming might increase
      the release of atmospheric greenhouse gases, thereby producing positive feedback 
      for global warming. However, how climate warming affects litter decomposition is 
      still unclear in lake ecosystems. Here, we tested the effects of constant and
      variable warming on the bacterial metabolic potential of typically submerged
      macrophyte (Potamogeton crispus L.) litters during decomposition in 18 mesocosms 
      (2500 L each). The results showed that warming reduced main chemoheterotrophic
      metabolic potential but promoted methylotrophy metabolism, which means that
      further warming may alter methane-cycling microbial metabolism. The nitrate
      reduction function was inhibited under warming treatments, and nitrogen fixation 
      capability significantly increased under variable warming in summer. The changes 
      in dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, conductivity and ammonium nitrogen driven by
      warming are the main environmental factors affecting the bacteria's metabolic
      potential. The effects of warming and environmental factors on fermentation,
      nitrate reduction and ammonification capabilities in stem and leaf litter were
      different, and the bacterial potential in the stem litter were more strongly
      responsive to environmental factors. These findings suggest that warming may
      considerably alter bacterial metabolic potential in macrophyte litter,
      contributing to long-term positive feedback between the C and N cycle and
      climate.

TI  - Control of Maize Sheath Blight and Elicit Induced Systemic Resistance Using
      Paenibacillus polymyxa Strain SF05.

LID - 10.3390/microorganisms10071318 [doi]
AB  - Maize (Zea mays L.) is an important crop in the world and maize sheath blight
      damages the yield and quality greatly. In this study, an antagonist strain, which
      exhibited antagonism against pathogenic fungi of maize and controlled maize
      banded leaf sheath blight in the field, was effectively isolated and named
      Paenibacillus polymyxa strain SF05. High cellulase and chitinase activity of the 
      strain were detected in this study, which might contribute to degrading the cell 
      wall of fungi. Furthermore, different resistant genes such as ZmPR1a, OPR1 and
      OPR7 were elicited differently by the strain in the leaves and stems of maize. In
      order to explain the biocontrol mechanism of P. polymyxa strain SF05, the genome 
      was sequenced and then the genes involving the biocontrol mechanism including
      biofilm formation pathways genes, cell wall degradation enzymes, secondary
      metabolite biosynthesis gene clusters and volatile organic compounds biosynthesis
      genes were predicted. The study revealed the biocontrol mechanism of P. polymyxa 
      strain SF05 preliminary and laid a foundation for further research of biocontrol 
      mechanism of P. polymyxa.

TI  - Profile of the Gut Microbiome Containing Carbapenem-Resistant Enterobacteriaceae 
      in ICU Patients.
LID - 1309 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms10071309 [doi]
AB  - Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) is a risk to public health
      worldwide and causes epidemic outbreaks in hospitals. The identification of
      alterations in the gut microbial profile can potentially serve as an early
      diagnostic tool to prevent harmful bacterial colonization. The purpose of this
      study was to characterize the gut microbiota profile of CRE-positive stool
      samples using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and to compare it with that of healthy
      control groups at King AbdulAziz University Hospital. Our results demonstrate
      that compared to the control group samples, the CRE-positive and CRE-negative
      group samples were less diverse and were dominated by a few operational taxonomic
      clusters of Enterococcus, Sphingomonas, and Staphylococcus. An analysis of
      samples from CRE-positive patients revealed Pseudomonas as the most abundant
      taxon. The existence of Pseudomonas in clinical samples undoubtedly indicates the
      development of resistance to a variety of antimicrobial drugs, with a less
      diverse microbiota. In our study, we found that the co-occurrence patterns of
      Klebsiella, Parabacteroides, Proteus and Pseudomonas differed between the
      CRE-negative and control stool groups.

TI  - Effect of Biltong Dried Beef Processing on the Reduction of Listeria
      monocytogenes, E. coli O157:H7, and Staphylococcus aureus, and the Contribution
      of the Major Marinade Components.
LID - 1308 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms10071308 [doi]
AB  - Biltong is a dry beef product that is manufactured without a heat lethality step,
      raising concerns of whether effective microbial pathogen reduction can occur
      during biltong processing. Raw beef inoculated with 4-strain cocktails of either 
      E. coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, or Staphylococcus aureus, and processed 
      with a standard biltong process, were shown to incur a &gt;5-log reduction in 6-8
      days after marination by vacuum-tumbling for 30 min in vinegar, salt, spices
      (coriander, pepper) when dried at 23.9 degrees C (75 degrees F) at 55% relative
      humidity (RH). Pathogenic challenge strains were acid-adapted in media containing
      1% glucose to ensure that the process was sufficiently robust to inhibit acid
      tolerant strains. Internal water activity (Aw) reached &lt; 0.85 at 5-log
      reduction levels, ensuring that conditions were lower than that which would
      support bacterial growth, or toxin production by S. aureus should it be
      internalized during vacuum tumbling. This was further confirmed by ELISA testing 
      for staphylococcal enterotoxins A and B (SEA, SEB) after marination and again
      after 10 days of drying whereby levels were lower than initial post-marination
      levels. Comparison of log reduction curves obtained for E. coli O157:H7, L.
      monocytogenes, S. aureus, and Salmonella (prior study) showed that microbial
      reduction was not significantly different (p &lt; 0.05) demonstrating that even
      without a heat lethality step, the biltong process we examined produces a safe
      beef product according to USDA-FSIS guidelines.

TI  - Retardation of Bacterial Biofilm Formation by Coating Urinary Catheters with
      Metal Nanoparticle-Stabilized Polymers.
LID - 1297 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms10071297 [doi]
AB  - Urinary catheter infections remain an issue for many patients and can complicate 
      their health status, especially for individuals who require long-term
      catheterization. Catheters can be colonized by biofilm-forming bacteria resistant
      to the administered antibiotics. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the
      efficacy of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) stabilized with different polymeric
      materials generated via a one-step simple coating technique for their ability to 
      inhibit biofilm formation on urinary catheters. AgNPs were prepared and
      characterized to confirm their formation and determine their size, charge,
      morphology, and physical stability. Screening of the antimicrobial activity of
      nanoparticle formulations and determining minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) 
      and their cytotoxicity against PC3 cells were performed. Moreover, the
      antibiofilm activity and efficacy of the AgNPs coated on the urinary catheters
      under static and flowing conditions were examined against a clinical isolate of
      Escherichia coli. The results showed that the investigated polymers could form
      physically stable AgNPs, especially those prepared using polyvinyl pyrrolidone
      (PVP) and ethyl cellulose (EC). Preliminary screening and MIC determinations
      suggested that the AgNPs-EC and AgNPs-PVP had superior antibacterial effects
      against E. coli. AgNPs-EC and AgNPs-PVP inhibited biofilm formation to 58.2% and 
      50.8% compared with AgNPs-PEG, silver nitrate solution and control samples. In
      addition, coating urinary catheters with AgNPs-EC and AgNPs-PVP at concentrations
      lower than the determined IC50 values significantly (p &lt; 0.05; t-test)
      inhibited bacterial biofilm formation compared with noncoated catheters under
      both static and static and flowing conditions using two different types of
      commercial Foley urinary catheters. The data obtained in this study provide
      evidence that AgNP-coated EC and PVP could be useful as potential antibacterial
      and antibiofilm catheter coating agents to prevent the development of urinary
      tract infections caused by E. coli.

TI  - Ergonomics Design and Assistance Strategy of A-Suit.
LID - 1114 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/mi13071114 [doi]
AB  - Concerning the biomechanics and energy consumption of the lower limbs, a soft
      exoskeleton for the powered plantar flexion of the ankle, named A-Suit, was
      developed to improve walking endurance in the lower limbs and reduce metabolic
      consumption. The method of ergonomics design was used based on the biological
      structures of the lower limbs. A profile of auxiliary forces was constructed
      according to the biological force of the Achilles tendon, and an iterative
      learning control was applied to shadow this auxiliary profile by iteratively
      modifying the traction displacements of drive units. During the evaluation of the
      performance experiments, four subjects wore the A-Suit and walked on a treadmill 
      at different speeds and over different inclines. Average heart rate was taken as 
      the evaluation index of metabolic consumption. When subjects walked at a moderate
      speed of 1.25 m/s, the average heart rate Hav under the Power-ON condition was
      7.25 +/- 1.32% (mean +/- SEM) and 14.40 +/- 2.63% less than the condition of
      No-suit and Power-OFF. Meanwhile, the additional mass of A-Suit led to a maximum 
      Hav increase of 7.83 +/- 1.44%. The overall reduction in Hav with Power-ON over
      the different inclines was 6.93 +/- 1.84% and 13.4 +/- 1.93% compared with that
      of the No-Suit and Power-OFF condition. This analysis offers interesting insights
      into the viability of using this technology for human augmentation and assistance
      for medical and other purposes.

TI  - IoT Wheelchair Control System Based on Multi-Mode Sensing and Human-Machine
      Interaction.
LID - 1108 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/mi13071108 [doi]
AB  - Traditional wheelchairs are unable to actively sense the external environment
      during use and have a single control method. Therefore, this paper develops an
      intelligent IoT wheelchair with the three functions, as follows. (1)
      Occupant-wheelchair-environment multimode sensing: the PAJ7620 sensor is used to 
      recognize gesture information, while GPS (Global Positioning System) and IMU
      (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensors are used to sense positioning, speed and
      postural information. In addition, Lidar, DHT11, and BH1750 sensors obtain
      environmental information such as road information, temperature and humidity and 
      light intensity. (2) Fusion control scheme: a mobile control scheme based on
      rocker and gesture recognition, as well as a backrest and footrest lifting,
      lowering and movement control scheme based on Tencent Cloud and mobile APP
      (Application). (3) Human-machine interaction: the wheelchair is docked to Tencent
      IoT Explorer through ESP8266 WiFi module, using MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry
      Transport) protocol is used to upload sensory data, while the wheelchair status
      can be viewed and controlled on the APP. The wheelchair designed in this paper
      can sense and report the status of the occupant, environment and wheelchair in
      real time, while the user can view the sensory data on the mobile APP and control
      the wheelchair using the rocker, gestures and APP.

TI  - A Multi-Electrode Pixel Structure for Quick-Response Electrowetting Displays.
LID - 1103 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/mi13071103 [doi]
AB  - A new reflective display technology, the electrowetting display (EWD), has the
      advantages of high contrast ratio, high reflectivity, and ultralow power
      consumption. The response speed of EWDs has an important influence on optical
      performance, and pixel structure is one of the key factors affecting the response
      speed of EWDs. In order to improve the response speed, a new multi-electrode
      pixel structure is proposed in this paper. This structure was realized by
      dividing the pixel into four square-shaped sub-electrodes, and a
      three-dimensional EWD simulation model was established. In this model, a driving 
      voltage was first applied to one of these sub-electrodes, and the oil was
      ruptured. Then, its two adjacent sub-electrodes were also supplied with driving
      voltages, so as to spur the oil to move to a pixel corner quickly. Simulation
      results showed that the response speed of EWDs can be effectively improved by
      using the proposed multi-electrode pixel structure. Compared with a
      single-electrode pixel structure, the oil rupture response time of the
      multi-electrode pixel structure was advanced by 0.6 ms. The pixel achieved a 2.7 
      ms faster response time than the single-electrode pixel for reaching a 50%
      aperture ratio in an opening process, and the maximum aperture ratio was
      increased by 6.2%.

TI  - Evaluation on Temperature-Dependent Transient VT Instability in p-GaN Gate HEMTs 
      under Negative Gate Stress by Fast Sweeping Characterization.
LID - 1096 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/mi13071096 [doi]
AB  - In this work, temperature-dependent transient threshold voltage (VT) instability 
      behaviors in p-GaN/AlGaN/GaN HEMTs, with both Schottky gate (SG) and Ohmic gate
      (OG), were investigated systematically, under negative gate bias stress, by a
      fast voltage sweeping method. For SG devices, a concave-shaped VT evolution
      gradually occurs with the increase in temperature, and the concave peak appears
      faster with increasing reverse bias stress, followed by a corresponding
      convex-shaped VT recovery process. In contrast, the concave-shaped VT evolution
      for OG devices that occurred at room temperature gradually disappears in the
      opposite shifting direction with the increasing temperature, but the
      corresponding convex-shaped VT recovery process is not observed, substituted,
      instead, with a quick and monotonic recovery process to the initial state. To
      explain these interesting and different phenomena, we proposed physical
      mechanisms of time and temperature-dependent hole trapping, releasing, and
      transport, in terms of the discrepancies in barrier height and space charge
      region, at the metal/p-GaN junction between SG and OG HEMTs.

TI  - Mechanical Characterization and Modelling of Subcellular Components of Oocytes.
LID - 1087 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/mi13071087 [doi]
AB  - The early steps of embryogenesis are controlled exclusively by the quality of
      oocyte that linked closely to its mechanical properties. The mechanical
      properties of an oocyte were commonly characterized by assuming it was
      homogeneous such that the result deviated significantly from the true fact that
      it was composed of subcellular components. In this work, we accessed and
      characterized the subcellular components of the oocytes and developed a layered
      high-fidelity finite element model for describing the viscoelastic responses of
      an oocyte under loading. The zona pellucida (ZP) and cytoplasm were isolated from
      an oocyte using an in-house robotic micromanipulation platform and placed on AFM 
      to separately characterizing their mechanical profiling by analyzing the creep
      behavior with the force clamping technique. The spring and damping parameters of 
      a Kelvin-Voigt model were derived by fitting the creeping curve to the model,
      which were used to define the shear relaxation modulus and relaxation time of ZP 
      or cytoplasm in the ZP and cytoplasm model. In the micropipette aspiration
      experiment, the model was accurate sufficiently to deliver the time-varying
      aspiration depth of the oocytes under the step negative pressure of a
      micropipette. In the micropipette microinjection experiment, the model accurately
      described the intracellular strain introduced by the penetration. The developed
      oocyte FEM model has implications for further investigating the viscoelastic
      responses of the oocytes under different loading settings.

TI  - Bond Wire Damage Detection Method on Discrete MOSFETs Based on Two-Port Network
      Measurement.
LID - 1075 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/mi13071075 [doi]
AB  - Bond wire damage is one of the most common failure modes of metal-oxide
      semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) power devices in wire-welded
      packaging. This paper proposes a novel bond wire damage detection approach based 
      on two-port network measurement by identifying the MOSFET source parasitic
      inductance (LS). Numerical calculation shows that the number of bond wire
      liftoffs will change the LS, which can be used as an effective bond wire damage
      precursor. Considering a power MOSFET as a two-port network, LS is accurately
      extracted from frequency domain impedance (Z-parameter) using a vector network
      analyzer under zero biasing conditions. Bond wire cutoff experiments are employed
      to validate the proposed approach for bond wire damage detection. The result
      shows that LS increases with the rising severity of bond wire faults, and even
      the slight fault shows a high sensitivity, which can be effectively used to
      quantify the number of bond wire liftoffs of discrete MOSFETs. Meanwhile, the
      source parasitic resistance (RS) extracted from the proposed two-port network
      measurement can be used for the bond wire damage detection of high switching
      frequency silicon carbide MOSFETs. This approach offers an effective quality
      screening technology for discrete MOSFETs without power on treatment.

      Pumps under Thermodynamic Effect.
LID - 1063 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/mi13071063 [doi]
AB  - In order to study the influence of thermodynamic effects on the cavitation
      performance of hydromechanics, the Singhal cavitation model was modified
      considering the influence of the thermo-dynamic effects, and the modified
      cavitation model was written into CFX using the CEL language. Numerical
      simulation of the cavitation full flow field at different temperatures (25
      degrees C, 50 degrees C and 70 degrees C) was carried out with the automotive
      electronic water pump as the research object. The results show that the variation
      trend of the external characteristic simulation and experimental values is the
      same at all flow rates, and the calculation accuracy meets the subsequent
      cavitation demand. With the increase in temperature, the low-pressure area inside
      the automotive electronic pump's impeller decreases. NPSHr decreases and the
      cavitation resistance is enhanced. During the process of no cavitation to
      cavitation, the maximum pressure pulsation amplitude in the impeller channel
      gradually increases. The generation and collapse of cavitations cause the change 
      of pressure pulsation in the internal flow field, causing pump vibration.

TI  - An Efficient YOLO Algorithm with an Attention Mechanism for Vision-Based Defect
      Inspection Deployed on FPGA.
LID - 1058 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/mi13071058 [doi]
AB  - Industry 4.0 features intelligent manufacturing. Among them, the vision-based
      defect inspection algorithm is remarkable for quality control in parts
      manufacturing. With the help of AI and machine learning, auto-adaptive instead of
      manual operation is achievable in this field, and much progress has been made in 
      recent years. In this study, considering the demand of inspection features in
      industrialization, we made further improvement in smart defect inspection. An
      efficient algorithm using Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)-accelerated You
      Only Look Once (YOLO) v3 based on an attention mechanism is proposed. First,
      because of the relatively fixed camera angle and defect features, an attention
      mechanism based on the concept of directing the focus of defect inspection is
      proposed. The attention mechanism consists of three improvements: (a) image
      preprocessing, which is to tailor images for selectively concentrating on the
      defect relevant things. Image preprocessing mainly includes cutting, zooming and 
      splicing, named CZS operations. (b) Tailoring the YOLOv3 backbone network, which 
      is to ignore invalid inspection regions in deep neural networks and optimize the 
      network structure. (c) Data augmentation. First, two improvements can be made to 
      efficiently reduce deep learning operations and accelerate the inspection speed, 
      but the preprocessed images are similar and the lack of diversity will reduce
      network accuracy. So, (c) is added to mitigate the lack of considerable amounts
      of training data. Second, the algorithm is deployed on a PYNQ-Z2 FPGA board to
      meet the industrialization production requirements for accuracy, efficiency and
      extensibility. FPGA can provide a low-latency, low-cost, high-power-efficiency
      and flexible architecture that enables deep learning acceleration for industrial 
      scenarios. A Xilinx Deep Neural Network Development Kit (DNNDK) converted the
      improved YOLOv3 to Programmable Logic (PL), which can be deployed on FPGA. The
      conversion process mainly consists of pruning, quantization and compilation.
      Experimental results showed that the algorithm had high efficiency, inspection
      accuracy reached 99.2%, processing speed reached 1.54 Frames per Second (FPS),
      and power consumption was only 10 W.

TI  - Tunable Dual-Wavelength with Twin-Pulse Dissipative Solitons in All-Normal
      Dispersion Yb-Doped Fiber Laser.
LID - 1049 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/mi13071049 [doi]
AB  - A tunable dual-wavelength with two separated twin-pulse dissipative solitons
      (DSs) of Yb-doped mode-locked fiber laser in the all-normal-dispersion (ANDi)
      regime is firstly reported and demonstrated in this paper. A Sagnac loop is used 
      as an all-fiber format spectral filter in the laser cavity, and stable twin-pulse
      DSs with different wavelength mode-locked lasers are achieved by the nonlinear
      polarization evolution (NPE) effect. By adjusting the polarization state of the
      Sagnac loop, the spectral ranges of the dual-wavelength can be tuned from 1031.3 
      nm to 1041.5 nm and from 1067.1 nm to 1080.9 nm, respectively. However, the pulse
      space between the two separated twin-pulse DSs is maintained, i.e., 41.63 ns.
      Furthermore, the twin-pulse can regress to the single-pulse when the pump power
      keeps dropping. It has been observed that the highest energy of the two
      twin-pulse DSs output is 23.36 nJ at a repetition rate of 2.282 MHz with a
      maximum pump power of 560 mW.

TI  - A Fiber-Based SPR Aptasensor for the In Vitro Detection of Inflammation
      Biomarkers.
LID - 1036 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/mi13071036 [doi]
AB  - It is widely accepted that the abnormal concentrations of different inflammation 
      biomarkers can be used for the early diagnosis of cardiovascular disease (CVD).
      Currently, many reported strategies, which require extra report tags or bulky
      detection equipment, are not portable enough for onsite inflammation biomarker
      detection. In this work, a fiber-based surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor 
      decorated with DNA aptamers, which were specific to two typical inflammation
      biomarkers, C-reactive protein (CRP) and cardiac troponin I (cTn-I), was
      developed. By optimizing the surface concentration of the DNA aptamer, the
      proposed sensor could achieve a limit of detection (LOD) of 1.7 nM (0.204 mug/mL)
      and 2.5 nM (57.5 ng/mL) to CRP and cTn-I, respectively. Additionally, this
      biosensor could also be used to detect other biomarkers by immobilizing
      corresponding specific DNA aptamers. Integrated with a miniaturized spectral
      analysis device, the proposed sensor could be applied for constructing a portable
      instrument to provide the point of care testing (POCT) for CVD patients.

TI  - Topological and Mechanical Properties of Different Lattice Structures Based on
      Additive Manufacturing.
LID - 1017 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/mi13071017 [doi]
AB  - The appearance and development of additive manufacturing technology promotes the 
      production and manufacture of parts with more complex designs and smaller sizes
      and realizes the complex topology that cannot be made by equal-material
      manufacturing and submanufacturing. Nowadays, the application of tri-periodic
      minimal surface (TPMS) in topology optimization design has become a new choice,
      and, because of its excellent structure and properties, has gradually become
      mainstream. In this paper, the mechanical properties of four different topologies
      prepared by selective laser melting (SLM) using 316L stainless steel powder were 
      investigated, including two TPMS sheet structures (Primitive surface, Gyroid
      surface) and two common lattice structures (Bcc lattice, truss lattice). The
      mechanical properties (Young's modulus, yield stress, plateau stress, and
      toughness) were compared by numerical simulation and compression experiment. It
      can be concluded from the results that the mechanical properties and deformation 
      mechanism of the specimen are mainly related to the type of lattice, though have 
      little relationship with unit thickness at the same relative density. The Gyroid 
      curved structure showed the best mechanical properties and energy absorption
      capacity, followed by the truss lattice structure. By comparison, the mechanical 
      properties of the traditional Bcc lattice structure and the Primitive surface
      structure are poor, and the deformation mechanism of these two structures is
      uncertain and difficult to control.

TI  - Design and Fabrication of Silicon-Blazed Gratings for Near-Infrared Scanning
      Grating Micromirror.
LID - 1000 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/mi13071000 [doi]
AB  - Blazed gratings are the critical dispersion elements in spectral analysis
      instruments, whose performance depends on structural parameters and topography of
      the grating groove. In this paper, high diffraction efficiency silicon-blazed
      grating working at 800-2500 nm has been designed and fabricated. By diffraction
      theory analysis and simulation optimization based on the accurate boundary
      integral equation method, the blaze angle and grating constant are determined to 
      be 8.8 degrees and 4 mum, respectively. The diffraction efficiency is greater
      than 33.23% in the spectral range of 800-2500 nm and reach the maximum value of
      85.62% at the blaze wavelength of 1180 nm. The effect of platform and fillet on
      diffraction efficiency is analyzed, and the formation rule and elimination method
      of the platform are studied. The blazed gratings are fabricated by anisotropic
      wet etching process using tilted (111) silicon substrate. The platform is
      minished by controlling etching time and oxidation sharpening process. The fillet
      radius of the fabricated grating is 50 nm, the blaze angle is 7.4 degrees , and
      the surface roughness is 0.477 nm. Finally, the blazed grating is integrated in
      scanning micromirror to form scanning grating micromirror by MEMS fabrication
      technology, which can realize both optical splitting and scanning. The testing
      results show that the scanning grating micromirror has high diffraction
      efficiency in the spectral range of 810-2500 nm for the potential near-infrared
      spectrometer application.

TI  - Lithocholic Acid Alleviates Deoxynivalenol-Induced Lethal Cholesterol Metabolic
      Abnormalities in IPI-2I Cells.
LID - 659 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/metabo12070659 [doi]
AB  - Deoxynivalenol (DON) is a secondary metabolite of fungi. Ingestion of feed
      containing DON causes severe intestinal damage in humans and animals, possibly
      due to cholesterol-enriched lipid raft abnormalities. Cholic acid (CA) and
      lithocholic acid (LCA) are metabolites of cholesterol transformation, which have 
      been proven to benefit epithelial cell proliferation and reduce intestinal
      inflammation and lesions. Therefore, we aimed to study the protective roles of CA
      and LCA administration on the DON-exposed intestinal epithelial cells (IPI-2I)
      and the underlying mechanisms involved in cholesterol metabolism. We found that
      LCA pretreatment, but not CA, alleviated the reduction of cell numbers caused by 
      DON exposure. Furthermore, we demonstrate that LCA restored the DON-induced cell 
      apoptosis by reducing the cleaved caspase 3 and cleaved PARP-1 expression.
      DON-increased cellular cholesterol and bile acid contents were significantly
      reduced when LCA was co-treated. Further transcriptomic analysis revealed that
      the aberrant cholesterol homeostasis genes profile was observed in the cells
      exposed to DON or pretreated with LCA. We also validated that the key genes
      involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and transformation (cholesterol to bile
      acids) were strongly inhibited by the LCA treatment in the DON-exposed cells.
      Together, this study demonstrated that LCA ameliorated DON-caused toxic apoptosis
      in IPI-2I cells by maintaining cholesterol metabolism. We suggest that as an
      endogenous metabolite, LCA may be used as a therapeutic and/or integrated into a 
      dietary intervention against mycotoxin toxicity.

TI  - Impact of Cattle Feeding Strategy on the Beef Metabolome.
LID - 640 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/metabo12070640 [doi]
AB  - The present study explored changes in the meat metabolome of animals subjected to
      different finishing systems and growth rates. Thirty-six Angus x Nellore
      crossbred steers were used in a completely randomized design with four
      treatments: (1) feedlot system with high average daily gain (ADG; FH); (2)
      feedlot system with low ADG (FL); (3) pasture system with high ADG (PH); and (4) 
      pasture system with low ADG (PL). After harvest and chilling, Longissimus
      thoracis (LT) muscle samples were taken for metabolite profile analysis using
      nuclear magnetic resonance. Spectrum was analyzed using chenomx software, and
      multi- and mega-variate data analyses were performed. The PLS-DA showed clear
      separation between FH and PL groups and overlap among treatments with different
      finishing systems but similar for matching ADG (FL and PH) treatments. Using a
      VIP cut-off of around 1.0, ATP and fumarate were shown to be greater in meat from
      PL cattle, while succinate, leucine, AMP, glutamate, carnosine, inosine,
      methionine, G1P, and choline were greater in meat from FH. Comparing FL and PH
      treatments, glutamine, carnosine, urea, NAD+, malonate, lactate, isoleucine, and 
      alanine were greater in the meat of PH cattle, while G6P and betaine were
      elevated in that of FL cattle. Relevant pathways were also identified by
      differences in growth rate (FH versus PL) and finishing system were also noted.
      Growth rate caused a clear difference in meat metabolism that was highlighted by 
      energy metabolism and associated pathways, while the feeding system tended to
      alter protein and lipid metabolism.

      Associations with the Incidence of Postoperative Delirium.
LID - 616 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/metabo12070616 [doi]
AB  - The mechanisms underlying the occurrence of postoperative delirium development
      are unclear and measurement of plasma metabolites may improve understanding of
      its causes. Participants (n = 54) matched for age and gender were sampled from an
      observational cohort study investigating postoperative delirium. Participants
      were >/=65 years without a diagnosis of dementia and presented for primary
      elective hip or knee arthroplasty. Plasma samples collected pre- and
      postoperatively were grouped as either control (n = 26, aged: 75.8 +/- 5.2) or
      delirium (n = 28, aged: 76.2 +/- 5.7). Widespread changes in plasma metabolite
      levels occurred following surgery. The only metabolites significantly differing
      between corresponding control and delirium samples were ornithine and spermine.
      In delirium cases, ornithine was 17.6% higher preoperatively, and spermine was
      12.0% higher postoperatively. Changes were not associated with various
      perioperative factors. In binary logistic regression modeling, these two
      metabolites did not confer a significantly increased risk of delirium. These
      findings support the hypothesis that disturbed polyamine metabolism is an
      underlying factor in delirium that warrants further investigation.

TI  - PPARbeta/delta Augments IL-1beta-Induced COX-2 Expression and PGE2 Biosynthesis
      in Human Mesangial Cells via the Activation of SIRT1.
LID - 595 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/metabo12070595 [doi]
AB  - Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor beta/delta (PPARbeta/delta), a
      ligand-activated nuclear receptor, regulates lipid and glucose metabolism and
      inflammation. PPARbeta/delta can exert an anti-inflammatory effect by suppressing
      proinflammatory cytokine production. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)-triggered
      inflammation plays a crucial role in the development of many inflammatory
      diseases, including glomerulonephritis. However, the effect of PPARbeta/delta on 
      the expression of COX-2 in the kidney has not been fully elucidated. The present 
      study showed that PPARbeta/delta was functionally expressed in human mesangial
      cells (hMCs), where its expression was increased by interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) 
      treatment concomitant with enhanced COX-2 expression and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) 
      biosynthesis. The treatment of hMCs with GW0742, a selective agonist of
      PPARbeta/delta, or the overexpression of PPARbeta/delta via an
      adenovirus-mediated approach significantly increased COX-2 expression and PGE2
      production. PPARbeta/delta could further augment the IL-1beta-induced COX-2
      expression and PGE2 production in hMCs. Moreover, both PPARbeta/delta activation 
      and overexpression markedly increased sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) expression. The
      inhibition or knockdown of SIRT1 significantly attenuated the effects of
      PPARbeta/delta on the IL-1beta-induced expression of COX-2 and PGE2 biosynthesis.
      Taken together, PPARbeta/delta could augment the IL-1beta-induced COX-2
      expression and PGE2 production in hMCs via the SIRT1 pathway. Given the critical 
      role of COX-2 in glomerulonephritis, PPARbeta/delta may represent a novel target 
      for the treatment of renal inflammatory diseases.

TI  - Comparative Metabolomics Study of the Impact of Articaine and Lidocaine on the
      Metabolism of SH-SY5Y Neuronal Cells.
LID - 581 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/metabo12070581 [doi]
AB  - Articaine (ATC) and lidocaine (LDC) are the local anesthetics (LAs) currently
      most employed in dentistry. Cases of paresthesia, reported more frequently for
      ATC, have raised concerns about their potential neurotoxicity, calling for
      further investigation of their biological effects in neuronal cells. In this
      work, the impact of ATC and LDC on the metabolism of SH-SY5Y cells was
      investigated through (1)H NMR metabolomics. For each LA, in vitro cultured cells 
      were exposed to concentrations causing 10 and 50% reductions in cell viability,
      and their metabolic intracellular and extracellular profiles were characterized. 
      Most effects were common to ATC and LDC, although with varying magnitudes. The
      metabolic variations elicited by the two LAs suggested (i) downregulation of
      glycolysis and of glucose-dependent pathways (e.g., one-carbon metabolism and
      hexosamine biosynthetic pathway), (ii) disturbance of branched chain amino acids 
      (BCAA) catabolism, (iii) downregulation of TCA cycle anaplerotic fueling and
      activation of alternative energy producing pathways, (iv) interference with
      choline metabolism and (v) lipid droplet build-up. Interestingly, LDC had a
      greater impact on membrane phospholipid turnover, as suggested by higher
      phosphatidylcholine to phosphocholine conversion. Moreover, LDC elicited an
      increase in triglycerides, whereas cholesteryl esters accumulated in ATC-exposed 
      cells, suggesting a different composition and handling of lipid droplets.

TI  - Early Evolutionary Selection of NAD Biosynthesis Pathway in Bacteria.
LID - 569 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/metabo12070569 [doi]
AB  - Bacteria use two alternative pathways to synthesize nicotinamide adenine
      dinucleotide (NAD) from nicotinamide (Nam). A short, two-step route proceeds
      through nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) formation, whereas the other pathway, a
      four-step route, includes the deamidation of Nam and the reamidation of nicotinic
      acid adenine dinucleotide (NAAD) to NAD. In addition to having twice as many
      enzymatic steps, the four-step route appears energetically unfavourable, because 
      the amidation of NAAD includes the cleavage of ATP to AMP. Therefore, it is
      surprising that this pathway is prevalent not only in bacteria but also in yeast 
      and plants. Here, we demonstrate that the considerably higher chemical stability 
      of the deamidated intermediates, compared with their amidated counterparts, might
      compensate for the additional energy expenditure, at least at elevated
      temperatures. Moreover, comprehensive bioinformatics analyses of the available
      &gt;6000 bacterial genomes indicate that an early selection of one or the other
      pathway occurred. The mathematical modelling of the NAD pathway dynamics supports
      this hypothesis, as there appear to be no advantages in having both pathways.

TI  - Quantitative Assessment of Road Performance of Recycled Asphalt Mixtures
      Incorporated with Steel Slag.
LID - 5005 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ma15145005 [doi]
AB  - Circular utilization of reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) has received extensive
      attention for its economic and environmental benefits. The application of
      recycled asphalt mixtures (RAM) in the upper layer of asphalt pavement faces the 
      issue of inferior anti-slip performance and durability. This study aims to
      recycle steel slag as virgin aggregates in RAM and quantitatively evaluate the
      service performance of RAM with steel slag. Steel slag and basalt RAM were
      firstly fabricated and the five different RAP contents were involved. Then tests 
      of Marshall stability, indirect tensile strength and Cantabro spatter loss were
      conducted to investigate the moisture susceptibility of RAM. Moreover, their high
      temperature stability, crack resistance and skid resistance were characterized.
      Indirect tensile fatigue test combined with Hamburg wheel tracking test were
      carried out to discuss the durability of RAM. The comprehensive performance of
      RAM with steel slag were quantitatively assessed based on an improved radar chart
      evaluation method. The results show that involving steel slag reveals a
      remarkable enhancement function on water stability, high and low temperature
      performance, skid resistance and fatigue resistance of RAM. Steel slag RAM with
      50% RAP content demonstrates a rutting depth of 7.60 mm and a creep slope of 2.54
      x 10(-4), indicating its superior durability in high temperature and water
      environment. Compared with the comprehensive evaluation function of 0.5336 for
      basalt RAM with 30% RAP dosage, steel slag RAM reaches 0.7801, which represents
      its preferable road performance.

TI  - The New High-Pressure Phases of Nitrogen-Rich Ag-N Compounds.
LID - 4986 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ma15144986 [doi]
AB  - The high-pressure phase diagram of Ag-N compounds is enriched by proposing three 
      stable high-pressure phases (P4/mmm-AgN2, P1-AgN7 and P-1-AgN7) and two
      metastable high-pressure phases (P-1-AgN4 and P-1-AgN8). The novel N7 rings and
      N20 rings are firstly found in the folded layer structure of P-1-AgN7. The
      electronic structure properties of predicted five structures are studied by the
      calculations of the band structure and DOS. The analyses of ELF and Bader charge 
      show that the strong N-N covalent bond interaction and the weak Ag-N ionic bond
      interaction constitute the stable mechanism of Ag-N compounds. The charge
      transfer between the Ag and N atoms plays an important role for the structural
      stability. Moreover, the P-1-AgN7 and P-1-AgN8 with the high-energy density and
      excellent detonation properties are potential candidates for new high-energy
      density species.

TI  - Geotechnical Evaluation of Loess Modifications as the Sustainable Compacted Soil 
      Liner Material in Solid Waste Landfill.
LID - 4982 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ma15144982 [doi]
AB  - This paper studied the anti-seepage ability of the modified loess by using
      attapulgite, which is abundant in local areas. The possibility of using the
      modified loess as the sustainable compacted soil liner material in a solid waste 
      landfill was also considered in this research. The materials were then evaluated 
      using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), X-ray
      Diffraction (XRD), and an Impermeability Mechanism (IM). The experimental results
      showed that the permeability coefficient of the attapulgite-modified loess
      decreases significantly with increasing attapulgite content. However, it becomes 
      less significant when the attapulgite level approaches 10%. Both cases can meet
      the landfill impermeability requirements, based on the attapulgite content
      remaining at 10%, adding 15% lime or 5% cement, respectively. The triaxial
      consolidation and drainage experiment was carried out to investigate the shear
      strength of the materials under three different working circumstances. The
      stress-strain curves of each specimen were produced, as were the cohesion and
      internal friction angle values. This research lays the groundwork for using
      attapulgite-modified loess as a landfill lining material. It establishes a solid 
      platform for future studies on attapulgite adsorption and purifying performance
      in landfills.

TI  - Anti-Skid Characteristics of Asphalt Pavement Based on Partial Tire Aquaplane
      Conditions.
LID - 4976 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ma15144976 [doi]
AB  - This study presented a finite element model of radial tire-asphalt pavement
      interaction using ABAQUS 6.14 software to investigate the skid resistance
      properties of asphalt pavement under partial tire aquaplane conditions. Firstly, 
      the pavement profile datum acquired by laser scanning were imported to Finite
      Element Analysis (FEA) software to conduct the pavement modeling. Secondly, a
      steady state rolling analysis of a tire on three types of asphalt pavements under
      drying conditions was carried out. Variation laws of the friction coefficient of 
      the radial tire on different pavements with different pavement textures, tire
      pressures, and loads on the tire were examined. Subsequently, calculation results
      of the steady state rolling analysis were transmitted to dynamic explicit
      analysis, and an aquaplane model of a radial tire on asphalt pavements was built 
      by inputting the flow Euler grids. The tire-pavement adhesive characteristics
      under partial aquaplane conditions are discussed regarding the aquaplane model.
      Influences of the thickness of water film, the texture of asphalt pavement, and
      the rolling speed of the tire on the vertical pavement-tire contact force are
      analyzed. It is found that the vertical contact force between open graded
      friction course (OGFC) pavement and tire is the highest, followed by stone mastic
      asphalt (SMA) pavement and dense graded asphalt concrete (AC) pavement surface.
      The vertical contact force between tire and pavement will be greatly reduced,
      even with increasing speed or water film thickness. As tire speed increases from 
      70 km/h to 130 km/h, the tire-pavement contact force is reduced by about 25%.
      Moreover, when the thickness of water film increases from 0 (dry condition) to 4 
      mm and then to 12 mm, the vertical contact force reduced 50% and 15%,
      respectively, compared with under the dry contact condition. This study provided 
      a key theoretical reference for safe driving on wet pavements.

TI  - Study on the Initiation of Interface Crack in Rock Joints.
LID - 4881 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ma15144881 [doi]
AB  - The interfacial fracture of rock joints is an important although easily ignored
      issue in jointed rock engineering. To conduct this study, an interface crack
      model of rock joints was proposed. By analyzing the ratio of stress intensity
      factor to fracture toughness, the fracture mode of the interface crack was
      studied. Based on the Mohr-Coulomb criterion, an interface fracture criterion
      considering T-stress was established. To verify the proposed fracture criterion, 
      laboratory and numerical tests were conducted. Finally, the effect of relative
      critical size alpha, internal friction angle phi and cohesion c on the initiation
      of an interface crack was comprehensively discussed. It is concluded that the
      proposed fracture criterion can predit the initiation of the interface cracks
      properly. With an increase in cohesion c, mode II fracture toughness KIIC also
      clearly increases. When the absolute value of KI is small, the effect of alpha is
      much larger than that of phi. In addition, with an increase in the absolute value
      of the mode I stress intensity factor, the phi of the joint plays a more
      important role in the initiation of the interface crack.

TI  - Research on Mechanical Behavior of the Steel-Concrete-Steel Composite Structures 
      Subjected to High Temperature of Fire.
LID - 4872 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ma15144872 [doi]
AB  - A new type of steel-concrete-steel composite structure was adopted and widely
      used in the immersed tunnel of the Shenzhen-Zhongshan access. The research on the
      mechanical behavior of the new composite structure under a high temperature of
      fire is of great engineering significance to the fire protection design of the
      structure. Both the model test and a numerical simulation were adopted to study
      the mechanical behavior and damage characteristics of the new composite structure
      under fire. The RABT standard temperature rise curve was used to simulate the
      temperature rising law under fire (it reflects the characteristics of temperature
      rise in case of fire in an enclosed environment: rapidly raised to 1200 degrees C
      within 5 min, maintained at 1200 degrees C for 120 min, then it is cooled to
      normal temperature after 110 min). The temperature distribution law inside the
      structure, the deformation development law of the roof and the crack distribution
      were analyzed based on the thermal-mechanical coupling analysis method. The
      results showed that the internal part of the composite structure close to the
      fire surface was directly affected by the high temperature, and the temperature
      presented a step distribution law, while the part far from the fire surface was
      affected by the lag effect of the temperature transfer, and the temperature
      presented a continuous growth law. The roof deformation presented a three-stage
      model of "rapid growth-deformation stability-deformation recovery" with time. The
      overall cracks of the composite structure showed a symmetrical distribution under
      fire. The composite structure presented a shear failure mode as a whole. The
      results could provide a reference for the study of fire resistance for the new
      composite structure and support the structural fire protection design of the
      immersed tunnel of the Shenzhen-Zhongshan access.

TI  - Analytical Model for Early Design Stage of Cable-Stayed Suspension Bridges Based 
      on Hellinger-Reissner Variational Method.
LID - 4863 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ma15144863 [doi]
AB  - The cable-stayed suspension bridge is one type of bridge that has been
      increasingly applied to bridge engineering, especially in cross-sea projects.
      However, the complex combined system of this type of bridge makes it quite
      difficult for researchers to make a quick decision of the parameter values during
      the design stage. The Hellinger-Reissner method is applied here to analyze the
      deformation and force of the structural members in the bridge. The advantage of
      this method is that the solving of deformation and force is independent of each
      other, which would enhance the accuracy of the final results. Different load
      conditions are also considered in the analysis. The results from the present
      method are compared with test results and finite element analysis, and show good 
      agreements. It implies that the Hellinger-Reissner is a comparatively more
      efficient method to help designers choose the key parameters for cable-stayed
      suspension bridges.

TI  - A DFT-Based Quantitative and Geometric Analysis of the Effect of Pressure on
      Boron Arsenate.
LID - 4858 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ma15144858 [doi]
AB  - Boron arsenate, BAsO4, is a beta-cristobalite-like crystal which has been
      reported to exhibit the rather unusual property of negative linear
      compressibility behaviour at elevated pressures, that is expanding rather than
      shrinking in a linear dimension when subjected to pressure. This work proposes a 
      'geometry-deformation mechanism'-based mathematical model to aid the discernment 
      of the manner how this anomalous pressure behaviour is achieved. The model makes 
      use of data obtained from DFT simulations over an extended range of pressures,
      including extreme pressure conditions, and rigorously explains the macroscopic
      properties of this material in terms of the nanoscale deformations. More
      specifically, through this model, it was possible to decipher the different
      contributions to the deformation mechanism and compressibility properties of
      BAsO4. Moreover, for the first time, it was shown that a rule related to the sum 
      of angles of tetrahedrally coordinated atoms is so robust that it applies at the 
      extreme pressures studied here.

TI  - Structural Performance of EB-FRP-Strengthened RC T-Beams Subjected to Combined
      Torsion and Shear Using ANN.
LID - 4852 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ma15144852 [doi]
AB  - This research study applied Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to predict and
      evaluate the structural responses of externally bonded FRP (EB-FRP)-strengthened 
      RC T-beams under combined torsion and shear. Previous studies proved that,
      compared to reinforced concrete (RC) rectangular beams, RC T-beams performance in
      shear is significantly higher in structural analysis and design. The structural
      response of RC beams experiences a critical change while torsion moments are
      applied in load conditions. Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) is used to retrofit
      the structural elements due to changing structural design codes and loadings,
      especially in earthquake-prone countries. We applied Finite Element Method (FEM) 
      software, ABAQUS, to provide a precise numerical database of a set of
      experimentally tested FRP-retrofitted RC T-beams in previous research works. ANN 
      predicted structural analysis results and Mean Square Error (MSE) and Multiple
      Determination Coefficients &amp;nbsp;(R2) proved the accuracy of this study. The 
      MSE values that were less than 0.0009 and R2 values greater than 0.9960 showed
      that the ANN precisely fits the data. The consistency between analyzed
      experimental and numerical results demonstrated the accurate implication of ANN, 
      MSE, and R2 in predicting the structural responses of EB-FRP- strengthened RC
      T-beams.

TI  - Micro-Mechanism of Uniaxial Compression Damage of Layered Cemented Backfill in
      Underground Mine.
LID - 4846 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ma15144846 [doi]
AB  - Layering of filling body is common in large-scale filling areas. In this paper,
      the cement-sand ratio of 1:8 is based on the configuration of 68%, 70%, 72% and
      74%; four concentrations; and filling layers of one-, two-, three- and
      four-layered cemented filling samples. Combined with a uniaxial compression test 
      and two-dimensional particle flow software (PFC2D), the mechanical properties and
      failure modes were explored. The results show that the concentration can
      strengthen the uniaxial compressive strength of the filling body while increasing
      the filling times weakens its power; therefore, the constitutive damage model was
      constructed. It was found that the initial layered damage existed in the layered 
      filling, and the total damage showed an upward trend of first fast and then slow;
      the main failure modes of one-layer and two-layer backfills showed prominent
      shear failure characteristics, and the three-layer and four-layer fillings were
      closer to tensile failure. From the crack generation to the specimen failure,
      there is a mutual conversion between different energies.

LID - 10.3390/ma15144841 [doi]
AB  - Light-weight metal matrix composites, especially magnesium-based composites, have
      recently become more widespread for high-efficiency applications, including
      aerospace, automobile, defense, and telecommunication industries. The squeeze
      cast AZ91 base material (AZ91-BM) and its composites having 23 vol.% short carbon
      fibers were fabricated and investigated. The composite specimens were machined
      normal to the reinforced plane (Composite-N) and parallel to the reinforced plane
      (Composite-P). All the as-casted materials were subjected to different tests,
      such as hardness, compression, and wear testing, evaluating the mechanical
      properties. Dry wear tests were performed using a pin-on-disk machine at room
      temperature under different applied wear loads (1-5 N) and different sliding
      distances (0.4461x104-3.12x104 m). The microstructures and worn surfaces of the
      fabricated AZ91-BM and the two composite specimens were investigated using a
      scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with an energy dispersive
      spectroscopy (EDS) advanced analysis system. The wear debris was collected and
      investigated also under the SEM. The results showed significant improvement in
      hardness, compressive strength, and wear resistance of the composite specimens
      (Composite-N and Composite-P) over the AZ91-BM. The compressive strength and wear
      resistance are more fibers orientation sensitive than the hardness results. When 
      the fiber orientation is parallel to the sliding direction (Composite-N), the
      weight loss is somewhat lower than that of the fiber orientation perpendicular to
      the sliding direction (Composite-P) at a constant wear load of 2 N and the
      sliding distances of 0.4461x104, 1.34x104&amp;nbsp;, and 2.23x104 m. In contrast,
      the weight loss of Composite-P is lower than Composite-N, especially at the
      highest sliding distance of 3.12x104 m due to the continuous feeding of graphite 
      lubricant film and the higher compressive strength. Plastic deformation,
      oxidation, and abrasive wear are the dominant wear mechanisms of AZ91-BM; in
      contrast, abrasive and delamination wear are mainly the wear mechanisms of the
      two composites under the applied testing conditions.

TI  - Recent Progress on Graphene Flexible Photodetectors.
LID - 4820 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ma15144820 [doi]
AB  - In recent years, optoelectronics and related industries have developed rapidly.
      As typical optoelectronics devices, photodetectors (PDs) are widely applied in
      various fields. The functional materials in traditional PDs exhibit high
      hardness, and the performance of these rigid detectors is thus greatly reduced
      upon their stretching or bending. Therefore, the development of new flexible PDs 
      with bendable and foldable functions is of great significance and has much
      interest in wearable, implantable optoelectronic devices. Graphene with excellent
      electrical and optical performance constructed on various flexible and rigid
      substrates has great potential in PDs. In this review, recent research progress
      on graphene-based flexible PDs is outlined. The research states of graphene
      conductive films are summarized, focusing on PDs based on single-component
      graphene and mixed-structure graphene, with a systematic analysis of their
      optical and mechanical performance, and the techniques for optimizing the PDs are
      also discussed. Finally, a summary of the current applications of graphene
      flexible PDs and perspectives is provided, and the remaining challenges are
      discussed.

TI  - Hot Formability Study of Cr5 Alloy Steel by Integration of FEM and 3D Processing 
      Maps.
LID - 4801 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ma15144801 [doi]
AB  - Microstructure is an important factor that affects the mechanical properties and 
      service life of forgings. Through the full study of the formability of the
      material, the internal microstructure of the material can be effectively
      controlled. In order to accurately describe the formability of materials during
      thermal processing, 3D hot processing maps containing strains were established in
      this paper, and the 3D hot processing maps were coupled with the finite element
      method for simulation calculation. The Cr5 alloy steel was subjected to
      unidirectional thermal compression at a strain rate of 0.005-5 s(-1) and
      temperature range of 900-1200 degrees C on a Gleeble-1500D thermal simulation
      machine, in order to obtain the date of true stress and strain. Based on the
      dynamic material model (DMM), the 3D processing maps of Cr5 alloy steel was
      established, and the 3D processing maps were associated with the analysis of
      microstructure evolution during hot deformation. The results show that the
      optimum thermal deformation conditions are as follows: temperature of 1000-1125
      degrees C, strain rate of 0.01-0.2 s(-1), and peak power dissipation of 0.41. The
      3D processing maps were coupled with the finite element software FORGE((R)) to
      simulate the hot working process, and the distribution and change of power
      dissipation and flow instability domain on the metal deformation under different 
      thermal deformation conditions were obtained. The comparison between the
      simulation results and metallographic images of typical regions of metal
      deformation shows that they are in good agreement. This method can effectively
      predict and analyze the formability of materials during hot processing and
      provide guidance for practical industrial production.

TI  - Damage Characterization of Carbon Fiber Composite Pressure Vessels Based on Modal
      Acoustic Emission.
LID - 4783 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ma15144783 [doi]
AB  - This study characterized the damage characteristics of carbon fiber composite
      pressure vessels by the modal acoustic emission (MAE) method. The study showed
      how to use the extracted damage modal features and established MAE parameters to 
      determine the damage mode of composite pressure vessels. First, the A0 and S0
      Lamb modes of the AE signal were split through mode separation, and the time
      window was selected to establish the MAE characteristic parameters. Subsequently,
      based on the MAE parameters and the damage mode characteristics established from 
      single damage experiments, a damage mode discrimination method was established. A
      bending test of carbon fiber composite laminates proved that the modal separation
      method and the MAE parameters establishment are reasonable and effective. The
      results from the hydraulic test of the graded loading performed on 20 MPa carbon 
      fiber composite pressure vessels showed the accuracy of the damage mode
      discrimination method, and the damage state of the pressure vessel could be
      analyzed using the fiber fracture damage threshold according to the MAE
      parameters.

TI  - Low-Pb High-Piezoelectric Ceramic System
      (1-x)Ba(Zr0.18Ti0.82)O3-x(Ba0.78Pb0.22)TiO3.
LID - 4760 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ma15144760 [doi]
AB  - Piezoelectric materials, especially Pb-based piezoelectric materials, are widely 
      used in the key components of sensors, actuators, and transducers. Due to the
      rising concern of the toxicity of Pb, global legislation has been adopted to
      restrict the use of Pb. Given that the available Pb-free piezoelectric materials 
      cannot replace the Pb-based ones for various reasons, we designed and fabricated 
      a low-Pb piezoelectric solid-solution ceramic system,
      (1-x)Ba(Zr0.18Ti0.82)O3-x(Ba0.78Pb0.22)TiO3 (denoted as BZ0.18T-xBP0.22T herein).
      The crystal structure, ferroelectric, dielectric, and piezoelectric properties of
      the BZ0.18T-xBP0.22T system were systematically studied. With the increase in
      BP0.22T content, the structure of the samples changed from a rhombohedral phase
      to a tetragonal phase; the intermediate composition x = 0.5 was located at the
      morphotropic phase boundary of the system and corresponded to the state with the 
      coexistence of the rhombohedral and tetragonal phases. Moreover, x = 0.5
      exhibited the optimum comprehensive properties among all the samples, with a
      piezoelectric coefficient d33 of 240 pC/N, a maximum dielectric temperature Tm of
      121.1 degrees C, and a maximum polarization Pm of 15 muC/cm(2). Our work verifies
      the validity of the route to design low-Pb high-piezoelectric materials and may
      stimulate the interests for exploring new low-Pb high-performance ferroelectric
      and piezoelectric materials.

      Recently, Cesium (Cs)-doped Formamidinium tin iodide (FA1-xCsxSnI3) showed
      enhanced air, thermal, and illumination stability of PSCs. Hence, in this work,
      FA1-xCsxSnI3 PSCs have been rigorously studied and compared to pure FASnI3 PSCs
      using a solar cell capacitance simulator (SCAPS) for the first time. The aim was 
      to replace the conventional electron transport layer (ETL) TiO2 that reduces PSC 
      stability under solar irradiation. Therefore, FA1-xCsxSnI3 PSCs with different Cs
      contents were analyzed with TiO2 and stable ZnOS as the ETLs. Perovskite light
      absorber parameters including Cs content, defect density, doping concentration
      and thickness, and the defect density at the interface were tuned to optimize the
      photovoltaic performance of the PSCs. The simulation results showed that the
      device efficiency was strongly governed by the ETL material, Cs content in the
      perovskite and its defect density. All the simulated devices with ZnOS ETL
      exhibited PCEs exceeding 20% when the defect density of the absorber layer was
      below 1015&amp;nbsp;cm-3, and deteriorated drastically at higher values. The
      optimized structure with FA75Cs25SnI3 as light absorber and ZnOS as ETL showed
      the highest PCE of 22% with an open circuit voltage Voc of 0.89&amp;nbsp;V,
      short-circuit current density Jsc of 31.4&amp;nbsp;mA.cm-2, and fill factor FF of
      78.7%. Our results obtained from the first numerical simulation on Cs-doped
      FASnI3 could greatly increase its potential for practical production.

TI  - On the Morphological Deviation in Additive Manufacturing of Porous Ti6Al4V
      Scaffold: A Design Consideration.
LID - 4729 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ma15144729 [doi]
AB  - Additively manufactured Ti scaffolds have been used for bone replacement and
      orthopaedic applications. In these applications, both morphological and
      mechanical properties are important for their in vivo performance. Additively
      manufactured Ti6Al4V triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) scaffolds with
      diamond and gyroid structures are known to have high stiffness and high
      osseointegration properties, respectively. However, morphological deviations
      between the as-designed and as-built types of these scaffolds have not been
      studied before. In this study, the morphological and mechanical properties of
      diamond and gyroid scaffolds at macro and microscales were examined. The results 
      demonstrated that the mean printed strut thickness was greater than the designed 
      target value. For diamond scaffolds, the deviation increased from 7.5 mum (2.5%
      excess) for vertical struts to 105.4 mum (35.1% excess) for horizontal struts.
      For the gyroid design, the corresponding deviations were larger, ranging from
      12.6 mum (4.2% excess) to 198.6 mum (66.2% excess). The mean printed pore size
      was less than the designed target value. For diamonds, the deviation of the mean 
      pore size from the designed value increased from 33.1 mum (-3.0% excess) for
      vertical struts to 92.8 mum (-8.4% excess) for horizontal struts. The
      corresponding deviation for gyroids was larger, ranging from 23.8 mum (-3.0%
      excess) to 168.7 mum (-21.1% excess). Compressive Young's modulus of the bulk
      sample, gyroid and diamond scaffolds was calculated to be 35.8 GPa, 6.81 GPa and 
      7.59 GPa, respectively, via the global compression method. The corresponding
      yield strength of the samples was measured to be 1012, 108 and 134 MPa. Average
      microhardness and Young's modulus from alpha and beta phases of Ti6Al4V from
      scaffold struts were calculated to be 4.1 GPa and 131 GPa, respectively. The
      extracted morphology and mechanical properties in this study could help
      understand the deviation between the as-design and as-built matrices, which could
      help develop a design compensation strategy before the fabrication of the
      scaffolds.

TI  - Mesenchymal-Stem-Cell-Derived Extracellular Vesicles Attenuate Brain Injury in
      Escherichia coli Meningitis in Newborn Rats.
LID - 1030 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/life12071030 [doi]
AB  - We recently reported that transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)
      significantly reduced bacterial growth and brain injury in neonatal meningitis
      induced by Escherichia coli (E. coli) infection in newborn rats. As a next step, 
      to verify whether the MSCs protect against brain injury in a paracrine manner,
      this study was designed to estimate the efficacy of MSC-derived extracellular
      vesicles (MSC-EVs) in E. coli meningitis in newborn rats. E. coli meningitis was 
      induced without concomitant bacteremia by the intra-cerebroventricular injection 
      of 5 x 10(2) colony-forming units of K1 (-) E. coli in rats, at postnatal day 11.
      MSC-EVs were intra-cerebroventricularly transplanted 6 h after the induction of
      meningitis, and antibiotics were administered for three consecutive days starting
      at 24 h after the induction of meningitis. The increase in bacterial growth in
      the cerebrospinal fluid measured at 24 h after the meningitis induction was not
      significantly reduced following MSC-EV transplantation. However, an increase in
      brain cell death, reactive gliosis, and inflammation following meningitis were
      significantly attenuated after MSC-EV transplantation. Taken together, our
      results indicate that MSCs show anti-apoptotic, anti-gliosis, and
      anti-inflammatory, but not antibacterial effects, in an EV-mediated paracrine
      manner in E. coli-induced neonatal meningitis.

TI  - The Entomopathogenic Nematodes H. bacteriophora and S. carpocapsae Inhibit the
      Activation of proPO System of the Nipa Palm Hispid Octodonta nipae (Coleoptera:
      Chrysomelidae).
LID - 1019 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/life12071019 [doi]
AB  - Entomopathogenic nematodes are biocontrol agents of invasive insect pests in soil
      and cryptic habitats. Nipa palm hispid, Octodonta nipae, is a pest of palm trees 
      in Sothern China. To address its increasing damage, environmentally friendly
      control methods are required. This study aimed to test efficacy of
      Heterorhabditis bacteriophora and Steinernema carpocapsae on O. nipae and
      investigated the influence of secondary metabolites, nematodes, and their
      isolated cuticles on the activation of O. nipae's prophenoloxidase system using
      qPCR analysis. Our data revealed that O. nipae were less susceptible to H.
      bacteriophora than S. carpocapsae and penetrations of infective juveniles were
      higher with S. carpocapsae treatment than H. bacteriophora. Moreover, expression 
      levels of the serine protease P56, prophenoloxidase activation factor 1, PPO and 
      serine protease inhibitor 28 upon S. carpocapsae and H. bacteriophora infections 
      were generally downregulated at all times. However, upon heating, the cuticles
      lost their inhibitory effects and resulted in upregulation of the PPO gene.
      Similarly, the addition of arachidonic acid reversed the process and resulted in 
      the upregulation of the PPO gene compared to the control. Further work is needed 
      to identify toxic substances secreted by these EPNs to evade O. nipae's immune
      system.

TI  - Growth, Yield and Photosynthetic Performance of Winter Wheat as Affected by
      Co-Application of Nitrogen Fertilizer and Organic Manures.
LID - 1000 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/life12071000 [doi]
AB  - The application of organic manures was found to be beneficial, however, the
      integrated use of organic manures with chemical nitrogen fertilizers has proven
      more sustainable in increasing the photosynthetic attributes and grain yield of
      the winter-wheat crop. A multi-factor split-plot design was adopted, nitrogen and
      manure fertilizer treatments were set in the sub-plots, including
      nitrogen-gradient treatment of T1:0 kg N ha(-1), T2:100 kg N ha(-1), T3:200 kg N 
      ha(-1), and T4:300 kg N ha(-1) (pure nitrogen -fertilizer application) The 25%
      reduction in nitrogen combined with the manure-fertilizer application includes
      T5:75 kg N ha(-1) nitrogen and 25 kg N ha(-1) manure, T6:150 kg N ha(-1) nitrogen
      and 50 kg N ha(-1) manure, and T7:225 kg N ha(-1) nitrogen and 75 kg N ha(-1)
      manure. The maximum results of the total chlorophyll content and photosynthetic
      rate were 5.73 mg/g FW and 68.13 m mol m(-2) s(-1), observed under T4 in Zhongmai
      175, as compared to Jindong 22 at the heading stage. However, the maximum results
      of intercellular CO2 concentration were 1998.47 mumol mol(-1), observed under T3 
      in Jindong 22, as compared to Zhongmai 175 at the tillering stage. The maximum
      results of LAI were 5.35 (cm(2)), observed under T7 in Jindong 22, as compared to
      Zhongmai 175 at the booting stage. However, the maximum results of Tr and Gs were
      6.31 mmol H2O m(-2) s(-1) and 0.90 H2O mol m(-2) s(-1), respectively, observed
      under T7 in Zhongmai 175 as compared to Jindong 22 at the flowering stage. The
      results revealed that grain yield 8696.93 kg ha(-1), grains spike(-1) 51.33 (g), 
      and 1000-grain weight 39.27 (g) were significantly higher, under T3 in Zhongmai
      175, as compared to Jindong 22. Moreover, the spike number plot(-1) of 656.67
      m(2) was significantly higher in Jindong 22, as compared to Zhongmai 175. It was 
      concluded from the study that the combined application of nitrogen and manure
      fertilizers in winter wheat is significant for enhancing seed at the jointing and
      flowering stages. For increased grain yield and higher economic return, Zhongmai 
      175 outperformed the other cultivars examined. This research brings awareness
      toward the nitrogen-fertilizer-management approach established for farmers'
      practice, which might be observed as an instruction to increase agricultural
      management for the winter-wheat-growth season.

TI  - Metformin-Treatment Option for Social Impairment? An Open Clinical Trial to
      Elucidate the Effects of Metformin Treatment on Steroid Hormones and Social
      Behavior.
LID - 998 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/life12070998 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Social behavior is mediated by steroid hormones, whereby various
      lines of evidence indicate that metformin might improve the symptoms of social
      withdrawal. This directly yields to the aim of the study to correlate the impact 
      of metformin treatment on the potential alterations in steroid hormone
      homeostasis, which is ultimately impacting social behavior. Therefore, urinary
      samples of patients before and after treatment with metformin will be correlated 
      to social behavior to elucidate potential changes in steroid hormone profiles and
      social behavior. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An observational study in healthy adults
      with a new indication for metformin. Steroid hormone analysis, including the most
      prominent androgen, estrogen, progesterone, aldosterone, corticosterone,
      cortisone and cortisol metabolites analyzed with gas chromatography-mass
      spectrometry and a questionnaire on social behavior (Autism Spectrum
      Questionnaire (AQ)) will be administered prior to and after around a 12-week
      phase of metformin treatment. DISCUSSION: It is likely that due to different
      pathophysiological mechanisms such as an effect on the respiratory chain in
      mitochondria or via AMP-activated protein kinase, a general alteration of steroid
      hormone levels can be detected prior to post treatment. The encompassing
      measurement of steroid hormones shall give hints concerning the involvement of
      specific cascades yielding potential pharmacological targets for future research.

TI  - Exploring Quercetin Anti-Osteoporosis Pharmacological Mechanisms with In Silico
      and In Vivo Models.
LID - 980 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/life12070980 [doi]
AB  - Since osteoporosis critically influences the lives of patients with a high
      incidence, effective therapeutic treatments are important. Quercetin has been
      well recognized as a bone-sparing agent and thus the underlying mechanisms
      warrant further investigation. In the current study, the network pharmacology
      strategy and zebrafish model were utilized to explain the potential
      pharmacological effects of quercetin on osteoporosis. The potential targets and
      related signaling pathways were explored through overlapping target prediction,
      protein-protein interaction network construction, and functional enrichment
      analysis. Furthermore, we performed docking studies to verify the specific
      interactions between quercetin and crucial targets. Consequently, 55 targets were
      related to osteoporosis disease among the 159 targets of quercetin obtained by
      three database sources. Thirty hub targets were filtered through the cytoNCA
      plugin. Additionally, the Gene Ontology functions in the top 10 respective
      biological processes, molecular functions, and cell components as well as the top
      20 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways were depicted. The
      most significance difference in the KEGG pathways was the TNF signaling pathway, 
      consisting of the Nuclear Factor Kappa B Subunit (NF-kappaB), Extracellular
      Regulated Protein Kinases (ERK) 1/2, Activator Protein 1 (AP-1), Interleukin 6
      (IL6), Transcription factor AP-1 (Jun), and Phosphatidylinositol 3 Kinase (PI3K),
      which were probably involved in the pharmacological effects. Moreover, molecular 
      docking studies revealed that the top three entries were Interleukin 1 Beta
      (IL1B), the Nuclear Factor NF-Kappa-B p65 Subunit (RelA), and the Nuclear Factor 
      Kappa B Subunit 1 (NFKB1), respectively. Finally, these results were verified by 
      alizarin red-stained mineralized bone in zebrafish and related qPCR experiments. 
      The findings probably facilitate the mechanism elucidation related to quercetin
      anti-osteoporosis action.

TI  - Sublingual Vaccination with Live Influenza Virus Induces Better Protection Than
      Oral Immunization in Mice.
LID - 975 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/life12070975 [doi]
AB  - Both sublingual (SL) and oral vaccine administration modalities are convenient,
      easy, and safe. Here, we have investigated the differences in vaccine efficacy
      that are induced by oral and sublingual immunization with live influenza virus
      (A/Hong Kong/1/1968, H3N2) in mice. Intranasally administering a lethal dose of
      the influenza virus resulted in the deaths of the mice, whereas viral replication
      in the lungs did not occur upon SL or oral administration. At 30 days
      post-immunization through the SL or oral route, the mice were intranasally
      challenge-infected with the lethal dose of the homologous influenza virus. Both
      SL and oral immunizations with the influenza virus elicited significantly higher 
      levels of virus-specific IgG and IgA antibody responses, as well as HAI titers in
      the sera. Upon challenge infection, the SL immunization elicited higher levels of
      pulmonary IgG antibody and CD8(+) T cell responses than the oral immunization.
      Enhanced splenic germinal center B (GC B) and B cell proliferation were also
      detected from the SL immunization, both of which were significantly greater than 
      those of the oral immunization. Importantly, compared to oral immunization,
      significantly lessened lung viral loads and bodyweight reductions were observed
      from the SL immunization and these parameters contributed to prolonging the
      survival of the immunized mice. These results indicate that both SL and oral
      administration could be effective routes in inducing protective immunity against 
      influenza virus infection, with SL immunization being the better of the two
      delivery routes.

TI  - Entomopathogenic Fungi Infecting Lepidopteran Larvae: A Case from Central
      Argentina.
LID - 974 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/life12070974 [doi]
AB  - Immature stages of insects are vulnerable to various antagonists, including
      pathogens. While the abiotic factors affecting pathogen prevalence in insect
      populations are reasonably well documented, much less is known about relevant
      ecological interactions. We studied the probability of the larvae of three
      lepidopteran species to die from fungal infection as a function of insect species
      and food plants in central Argentina. Local free-growing food plants were used to
      feed the lepidopteran larvae. The prevalence of entomopathogenic fungi remained
      low (about 5%), which is a value well consistent with observations on similar
      systems in other regions. Eight fungal species recorded, primarily belonging to
      Fusarium and Aspergillus, add evidence to the reconsideration of the nutritional 
      modes in these genera in distinguishing the role of some species (complexes) to
      cause insect infections. Food plant species were found to have a substantial
      effect on the prevalence of entomopathogenic fungi. This was especially clear for
      the most abundant fungal species, a representative of the
      Fusarium&amp;nbsp;fujikuroi complex. Feeding on a particular plant taxon can thus
      have a specific fitness cost. Compared to the data collected from Northern
      Europe, the Argentinian assemblages from the families Aspergillaceae and
      Nectriaceae overlapped at the genus level but did not share species. It remains
      to be confirmed if this level of divergence in the composition of assemblages of 
      entomopathogenic fungi among distant regions represents a global pattern.

      lumbar spinal fusion surgery (LSFS) to explore the role of neuroinflammation and 
      oxidative stress as risk factors for POD. We analyzed 11 years' worth of data
      from the Smart Clinical Data Warehouse. We evaluated whether preoperative
      inflammatory markers, such as the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), the
      monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR), and the CRP-to-albumin ratio (CAR), affected 
      the development of POD in patients undergoing LSFS. Of the 3081 subjects
      included, 187 (7.4%) developed POD. A significant increase in NLR, MLR, and CAR
      levels was observed in POD patients (p &lt; 0.001). A multivariate analysis
      showed that the second, third, and highest quartiles of the NLR were
      significantly associated with the development of POD (adjusted OR (95% CI): 2.28 
      (1.25-4.16], 2.48 (1.3-4.73], and 2.88 (1.39-5.96], respectively). A receiver
      operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the discriminative ability of
      the NLR, MLR, and CAR for predicting POD was low, but almost acceptable (AUC (95%
      CI): 0.60 (0.56-0.64], 0.61 (0.57-0.65], and 0.63 (0.59-0.67], respectively, p
      &lt; 0.001). Increases in preoperative inflammatory markers, particularly the
      NLR, were associated with the development of POD, suggesting that a
      proinflammatory state is a potential pathophysiological mechanism of POD.

TI  - Impact of KRAS Mutation Subtypes and Co-Occurring Mutations on Response and
      Outcome in Advanced NSCLC Patients following First-Line Treatment.
LID - 4003 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jcm11144003 [doi]
AB  - (1) Background: The purpose was to systematically assess the impact of KRAS
      subtypes and co-mutations on responses of first-line treatment and outcomes by
      genetic classification in advanced KRAS mutant NSCLC. (2) Methods: Molecular
      pathology was confirmed with NGS; Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox multivariate
      model were used to analyze the efficacy of first-line treatment and prognosis in 
      KRAS subgroups. (3) Results: Advanced KRAS mutant NSCLC was confirmed among 183
      patients, who received first-line therapy. The most common KRAS subtype and
      co-mutation were G12C (29.5%) and TP53 (59.6%). ICIs/CHE group prolonged PFS to
      16.9 m, vs. (CHE)4.6 m vs. (CHE/BEV)7.0 m (p &lt; 0.0001); mOS (ICIs/CHE)37.1 m
      vs. (CHE)19.8 m vs. [CHE/BEV] 20.7 m (p = 0.024). PFS benefited to different
      degrees after first-line ICI-based treatment in each genetic classification. KRAS
      G12D even benefited from OS (p = 0.045). CHE/BEV prolonged mPFS of KRAS/STK11
      co-mutation (p = 0.043), but decreased mPFS in G12A subtype (p = 0.026).
      Multivariate analysis indicated that heavy smoking history (>/=20 pack-years) (HR
      = 0.45, p = 0.039) predicts optimistic prognosis; PS score 1 (HR = 3.604, p =
      0.002) and KRAS/SMAD4 co-mutation (HR = 4.293, p = 0.027) remained as independent
      predictors of shorter OS. (4) Conclusions: First-line treatment with ICI
      benefited KRAS-mutant-NSCLC patients and resulted in non-negative predictive
      value for any genetic classification. Bevacizumab should be cautiously chosen for
      patients with KRAS G12A subtype but is recommended for KRAS/STK11 patients.
      KRAS/SMAD4 is a new co-mutation genotype that displayed independent risk
      prognostic factors in patients with advanced KRAS-mutant NSCLC.

TI  - Bone Density May Be a Promising Predictor for Blood Loss during Total Hip
      Arthroplasty.
LID - 3951 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jcm11143951 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Total hip arthroplasty (THA), which is performed mostly in elderly
      individuals, can result in substantial blood loss and thereby imposes a
      significant physical burden and risk of blood transfusion. The femoral neck cut
      and reamed acetabulum are the main sites of intraoperative bleeding. Whether the 
      bone density in that region can be used to predict the amount of blood loss in
      THA is unknown. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed adult patients undergoing
      primary THA in the Department of Orthopedics, Peking Union Medical College
      Hospital, from January 2018 to January 2020. All these patients underwent primary
      unilateral THA. Patients had their bone mineral density (BMD) recorded within the
      week before surgery and were stratified and analyzed for perioperative blood
      loss. Multivariable regressions were utilized to adjust for differences in
      demographics and comorbidities among groups. RESULTS: A total of 176 patients
      were included in the study. Intraoperative blood loss was 280.1 +/- 119.56 mL.
      Pearson correlation analysis showed a significant correlation between blood loss 
      and preoperative bone density of both the femoral greater trochanter (R = 0.245, 
      p = 0.001) and the Ward's triangle (R = 0.181, p = 0.016). Stepwise multiple
      linear regression showed that preoperative bone density of the greater trochanter
      (p = 0.015, 95% CI: 0.004-0.049) and sex (p = 0.002) were independent risk
      factors for THA bleeding. The area under the receiver operating characteristic
      curve (AUROC) of the greater trochanter and Ward's triangle was 0.593 (95% CI:
      0.507-0.678, p = 0.035) and 0.603 (95% CI: 0.519-0.688, p = 0.018), respectively.
      The cutoff T value on the femoral greater trochanter for predicting higher
      bleeding was -1.75. CONCLUSIONS: In THA patients, preoperative bone density
      values of the femoral greater trochanter and sex could be promising independent
      predictors for bleeding during surgery. Osteoporosis and female patients might
      have lower blood loss in the THA operation.

TI  - Predicting Loss of Efficacy after Non-Medical Switching: Correlation between

      Patients with Rheumatic Disease.
LID - 1174 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jpm12071174 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We investigated how the non-medical switching (NMS) between
      Etanercept (ETN)/originator and SB4/biosimilar affects treatment efficacy in a
      rheumatic disease (RD) cohort, evaluating some laboratory parameters as loss of
      efficacy predictors after NMS. METHODS: We enrolled 124 patients with RD
      (rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis): 79 switchers
      from ETN/originator to SB4 and 45 naive patients receiving SB4 (first biological 
      treatment). At baseline, 6 (T1), and 12 months (T2), clinical and laboratory
      parameters were evaluated. RESULTS: In naive patients, TNF-alpha significantly
      increased at T1 in responders (NR) and non-responders (NNR). TNF-alpha was lower 
      in NNR than in NR at T1 and T2. In NR and NNR, drug levels (DL) increased between
      T1 and T2. However, DLs were lower in NNR than in NR at T1 and
      T2.&amp;nbsp;TNF-alpha was higher in switcher responders (SR) than in
      non-responders (SNR) at T1 and T2. In SNR, DLs were higher at baseline than in
      SR, but they decreased significantly at T1 and T2. CONCLUSIONS: We observed a
      decrease in DL and TNF-alpha levels after NMS in SNR. Moreover, in naive
      patients, DL and TNF-alpha levels were higher in NR than in NNR. Monitoring DL
      and TNF-alpha levels may represent a future precision medicine approach to
      predict loss of efficacy after NMS.

AB  - Verrucariaceae is the third-largest lichen family with high species diversity.
      However, this diversity has not been well-explored in China. We carried out a
      wide-scale field investigation in the arid and semi-arid regions of Northwest
      China from 2017 to 2021. A large number of lichen groups, especially those
      commonly distributed in deserts, were collected. Based on molecular phylogeny
      using ITS and nuLSU sequences by Bayesian and maximum likelihood analyses,
      combining morphological characters, seven taxa of catapyrenioid lichens in
      Verricariaceae were found in this study, including one genus (Clavascidium) and
      one species (Clavascidium lacinulatum) new to China; one genus (Placidium) new to
      the mainland of China; and four species (Clavascidium sinense,
      Placidium&amp;nbsp;nitidulum, Placidium&amp;nbsp;nigrum, and
      Placidium&amp;nbsp;varium) new to science. It enriched our understanding of the
      high species diversity in Verrucariaceae and the lichen flora of Chinese arid and
      semi-arid deserts.

TI  - Identification and Characterization of Calonectria Species Associated with Plant 
      Diseases in Southern China.
LID - 719 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jof8070719 [doi]
AB  - Calonectria species are important plant pathogens on a wide range of hosts,
      causing significant losses to plant production worldwide. During our survey on
      phytopathogenic fungi from 2019 to 2021, diseased samples were collected from
      various hosts in Guangdong Province, China. In total, 16 Calonectria isolates
      were obtained from leaf spots, stem blights and root rots of species of Arachis, 
      Cassia, Callistemon, Eucalyptus, Heliconia, Melaleuca and Strelitzia plants.
      Isolates were identified morphologically, and a multigene phylogenetic analysis
      of combined partial sequences of calmodulin (cmdA), translation elongation factor
      1-alpha (tef1-alpha) and beta-tubulin (beta-tubulin) was performed. These sixteen
      isolates were further identified as nine Calonectria species, with five new
      species: Ca. cassiae, Ca. guangdongensis,&amp;nbsp;Ca. melaleucae, Ca.
      shaoguanensis and Ca. strelitziae, as well as four new records: Ca. aconidialis
      from Arachis hypogaea, Ca. auriculiformis from Eucalyptus sp., Ca. eucalypti from
      Callistemon rigidus, and Ca. hongkongensis from Eucalyptus gunnii. Moreover, we
      provide updated phylogenetic trees for four Calonectria species complexes viz.
      Ca. colhounii, Ca. cylindrospora, Ca. kyotensis and Ca. reteaudii. Our study is
      the first comprehensive study on Calonectria species associated with various
      hosts from subtropical regions in China. Results from the present study will be
      an addition to the biodiversity of microfungi in South China.

TI  - Genomic and Chemical Profiling of B9, a Unique Penicillium Fungus Derived from
      Sponge.
LID - 686 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jof8070686 [doi]
AB  - This study presented the first insights into the genomic and chemical profiles of
      B9, a specific Penicillium strain derived from sponges of the South China Sea
      that demonstrated the closest morphological and phylogenetic affinity to P.
      paxillin. Via the Illumina MiSeq sequencing platform, the draft genome was
      sequenced, along with structural assembly and functional annotation. There were
      34 biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) predicted against the antiSMASH database,
      but only 4 gene clusters could be allocated to known BGCs (>/=50% identities).
      Meanwhile, the comparison between B9 and P. paxillin ATCC 10480 demonstrated
      clear distinctions in morphology, which might be ascribed to the unique
      environmental adaptability of marine endosymbionts. In addition, two novel
      pyridinones, penicidihydropyridone A (2) and penicidihydropyridone B (3), were
      isolated from cultures of B9, and structurally characterized by nuclear magnetic 
      resonance (NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS). The absolute configurations were
      confirmed by comparison of experimental and calculated electronic circular
      dichroism (ECD) curves. In addition, structure-based molecular docking indicated 
      that both neo-pyridinones might block the programmed cell death protein 1(PD-1)
      pathway by competitively binding a programmed cell death 1 ligand 1(PD-L1) dimer.
      This was verified by the significant inhibition rates of the PD-1/L1 interaction.
      These indicated that Penicillium sp. B9 possessed a potential source of active
      secondary metabolites.

LID - 10.3390/jof8070658 [doi]
AB  - The toothed jelly fungus Pseudohydnum gelatinosum was originally described from
      Europe. The name has a broad sense and the species has been widely reported
      almost all over the world. We have studied samples of so-called P. gelatinosum
      from Asia and Oceania. Based on morphology, hosts, geography, and phylogenetic
      analysis using the internal transcribed spacer regions (ITSs) and the large
      subunit of nuclear ribosomal RNA gene (nLSU), four new species, P. himalayanum,
      P. orbiculare, P. sinogelatinosum, and P. tasmanicum, from China, New Zealand,
      and Australia are described and illustrated, and a new combination, Pseudohydnum 
      totarae, is proposed. The five new taxa can be differentiated by the shape of
      their basidiomata, pileal surface color when fresh, spine size, basidiospore
      dimensions, shape of hyphidia, hosts, and biogeography. Phylogenetically, most of
      these taxa are distantly related, and different base pairs among these taxa
      mostly account for &gt;2% nucleotides in the ITS regions.

TI  - Role of the Gene ndufs8 Located in Respiratory Complex I from Monascus purpureus 
      in the Cell Growth and Secondary Metabolites Biosynthesis.
LID - 655 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jof8070655 [doi]
AB  - Our previous work revealed that the anabolism of Monascus secondary metabolites
      is closely related to cofactor metabolism. In this study, we have further
      investigated the regulation mechanisms of respiratory complex I in response to
      the cell growth and secondary metabolite biosynthesis of M. purpureus. The
      results showed that downregulating the mRNA level of gene ndufs8 in M. purpureus 
      sharply increased the secondary metabolites biosynthesis, cell growth and glucose
      consumption rates at the fermentation metaphase; slightly increased the colony
      diameter and biomass, and dramatically changed the mycelia morphology; and
      decreased the tolerances to environmental factors (especially H2O2). It also
      significantly inhibited the enzymes activities of respiratory complex I, III and 
      superoxide dismutase, but stimulated that of complex II, IV and peroxidase,
      leading to an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and a decrease in
      ATP concentration. Furthermore, transcriptome analysis revealed that the mRNA
      levels of genes involved in respiratory chain, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and
      fatty acid degradation were downregulated, but those in the citrinin and monascus
      pigment biosynthesis and related pathways were upregulated. These data revealed
      that complex I plays a vital role in regulating the cell growth and secondary
      metabolism of Monascus via changing the intracellular ROS and ATP levels.

LID - 10.3390/jof8070654 [doi]
AB  - Bjerkandera adusta is a species of common white rot polyporoid fungi found
      worldwide. Despite playing an important role in deadwood decay, the species
      strains are used in bioremediation due to its ability to degrade polycyclic
      hydrocarbons and some of them are important etiological agents of chronic coughs 
      and are associated with lung inflammations. In our experiments, diversity within 
      the species was investigated using molecular approaches and we found that
      sequence diversity seen at ITS sequence level is not due to cryptic speciation
      but to intragenomic variability of ITS sequences in this species.

TI  - Metabolome and Transcriptome Profiling Reveal That Four Terpenoid Hormones
      Dominate the Growth and Development of Sanghuangporus&amp;nbsp;baumii.
LID - 648 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jof8070648 [doi]
AB  - Sanghuangporus&amp;nbsp;baumii is a traditional medicinal fungus that produces
      pharmacological terpenoids, but natural resources are insufficient for
      applications, and its growth and development mechanisms are poorly understood.
      Combining metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses, we found four terpenoid
      hormones and a central gene, isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase (IDI), involved in
      growth and development. Additionally, an exogenous hormone test was used to
      further confirm the importance of the four terpenoid hormones. Finally, hormone
      content determination and qRT-PCR were performed to explore the growth and
      development mechanism; we found thatcis-zeatin (CZ) plays a major role in the
      mycelia stage, trans-zeatin (TZ) and gibberellin A4 (GA4) are important in the
      primordia stage, GA4 is crucial for the fruiting bodies stage, and abscisic acid 
      (ABA) may be a marker of maturity. The IDI gene was also found to affectterpenoid
      hormone content by regulating the relative gene transcript levels, thereby
      controlling morphological changes in S. baumii. Our results revealthe growth and 
      development mechanisms of S. baumii and may promote the breeding and utilisation 
      of high-quality varieties.

TI  - Genome-Wide Identification of Eucalyptus Heat Shock Transcription Factor Family
      and Their Transcriptional Analysis under Salt and Temperature Stresses.
LID - 8044 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23148044 [doi]
AB  - Heat shock transcription factors (HSFs) activate heat shock protein gene
      expression by binding their promoters in response to heat stress and are
      considered to be pivotal transcription factors in plants. Eucalyptus is a
      superior source of fuel and commercial wood. During its growth, high temperature 
      or other abiotic stresses could impact its defense capability and growth. Hsf
      genes have been cloned and sequenced in many plants, but rarely in Eucalyptus. In
      this study, we used bioinformatics methods to analyze and identify
      Eucalyptus&amp;nbsp;Hsf genes, their chromosomal localization and structure. The 
      phylogenetic relationship and conserved domains of their encoded proteins were
      further analyzed. A total of 36 Hsf genes were identified and authenticated from 
      Eucalyptus, which were scattered across 11 chromosomes. They could be classified 
      into three classes (A, B and C). Additionally, a large number of stress-related
      cis-regulatory elements were identified in the upstream promoter sequence of HSF,
      and cis-acting element analysis indicated that the expression of EgHsf may be
      regulated by plant growth and development, metabolism, hormones and stress
      responses. The expression profiles of five representative Hsf genes, EgHsf4,
      EgHsf9, EgHsf13, EgHsf24 and EgHsf32, under salt and temperature stresses were
      examined by qRT-PCR. The results show that the expression pattern of class B
      genes (EgHsf4, EgHsf24 and EgHsf32) was more tolerant to abiotic stresses than
      that of class A genes (EgHsf9 and EgHsf13). However, the expressions of all
      tested Hsf genes in six tissues were at different levels. Finally, we
      investigated the network of interplay between genes, and the results suggest that
      there may be synergistic effects between different Hsf genes in response to
      abiotic stresses. We conclude that the Hsf gene family played an important role
      in the growth and developmental processes of Eucalyptus and could be vital for
      maintaining cell homeostasis against external stresses. This study provides basic
      information on the members of the Hsf gene family in Eucalyptus and lays the
      foundation for the functional identification of related genes and the further
      investigation of their biological functions in plant stress regulation.

TI  - Different Roles of Dendritic Cells for Chronic Rhinosinusitis Treatment According
      to Phenotype.
LID - 8032 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23148032 [doi]
AB  - Dendritic cells (DCs) are antigen-presenting cells derived from the bone marrow
      that play an important role in the association between the innate and adaptive
      immune responses. The onset and development of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS)
      involve a serious imbalance in immune regulation and mechanical dysfunction
      caused by an abnormal remodeling process. Recent studies have shown that an
      increase in DCs in CRS and their function of shaping the nasal mucosal immune
      response may play an important role in the pathogenesis of CRS. In this review,
      we discuss DC subsets in mice and humans, as well as the function of DCs in the
      nasal sinus mucosa. In addition, the mechanism by which DCs can be used as
      targets for therapeutic intervention for CRS and potential future research
      directions are also discussed.

TI  - Overexpression of AcEXPA23 Promotes Lateral Root Development in Kiwifruit.
LID - 8026 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23148026 [doi]
AB  - Kiwifruit is loved by consumers for its unique taste and rich vitamin C content. 
      Kiwifruit are very sensitive to adverse soil environments owing to fleshy and
      shallow roots, which limits the uptake of water and nutrients into the root
      system, resulting in low yield and poor fruit quality. Lateral roots are the key 
      organs for plants to absorb water and nutrients. Improving water and fertilizer
      use efficiency by promoting lateral root development is a feasible method to
      improve yield and quality. Expansin proteins plays a major role in lateral root
      growth; hence, it is important to identify expansin protein family members,
      screen key genes, and explore gene function in root development. In this study,
      41 expansin genes were identified based on the genome of kiwifruit ('Hongyang',
      Actinidia chinensis). By clustering with the Arabidopsis thaliana expansin
      protein family, the 41 AcExpansin proteins were divided into four subfamilies.
      The AcExpansin protein family was further analysed by bioinformatics methods and 
      was shown to be evolutionarily diverse and conserved at the DNA and protein
      levels. Based on previous transcriptome data and quantitative real-time PCR
      assays, we screened the candidate gene AcEXPA23. Overexpression of AcEXPA23 in
      kiwifruit increased the number of kiwifruit lateral roots.

TI  - SUMOylation and Major Depressive Disorder.
LID - 8023 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23148023 [doi]
AB  - Since the discovery of the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) protein in 1995, 
      SUMOylation has been considered a crucial post-translational modification in
      diverse cellular functions. In neurons, SUMOylation has various roles ranging
      from managing synaptic transmitter release to maintaining mitochondrial integrity
      and determining neuronal health. It has been discovered that neuronal dysfunction
      is a key factor in the development of major depressive disorder (MDD). PubMed and
      Google Scholar databases were searched with keywords such as 'SUMO', 'neuronal
      plasticity', and 'depression' to obtain relevant scientific literature. Here, we 
      provide an overview of recent studies demonstrating the role of SUMOylation in
      maintaining neuronal function in participants suffering from MDD.

TI  - Genome-Wide Association Studies Reveal Novel Loci for Herbivore Resistance in
      Wild Soybean (Glycine soja).
LID - 8016 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23148016 [doi]
AB  - The production of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] is seriously threatened by
      various leaf-feeding insects, and wild soybean [Glycine soja Sieb. & Zucc.] has a
      greater resistance capacity and genetic diversity. In this study, a natural
      population consisting of 121 wild soybean accessions was used for detecting
      insect resistance genes. The larval weight (LW) of the common cutworm (CCW), the 
      resistance level (RL) and the index of damaged leaf (IDL) were evaluated as
      resistance indicators to herbivores. An association synonymous SNP AX-94083016
      located in the coding region of the respiratory burst oxidase gene GsRbohA1 was
      identified by genome-wide association study (GWAS) analyses. The overexpression
      of GsRbohA1 in soybean hairy roots enhanced resistance to CCW. One SNP in the
      promoter region cosegregated with AX-94083016 contributing to soybean resistance 
      to CCW by altering GsRbohA1 gene expression and reactive oxygen species (ROS)
      accumulation. Two major haplotypes, GsRbohA1(A) and GsRbohA1(G), were identified 
      based on the SNP. The resistant haplotype GsRbohA1(A) predominates in wild
      soybeans, although it has been gradually lost in landraces and cultivars. The
      nucleotide diversity around GsRbohA1 is much lower in landraces and cultivars
      than in its ancestors. In conclusion, a new resistant haplotype, GsRbohA1(A), was
      identified in wild soybean, which will be a valuable gene resource for soybean
      insect resistance breeding through introducing into improvement lines, and it
      offers a strategy for exploring resistance gene resources from its wild
      relatives.

TI  - Characterization and Functional Implications of the Nonexpressor of
      Pathogenesis-Related Genes 1 (NPR1) in Saccharum.
LID - 7984 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23147984 [doi]
AB  - Sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) is an important sugar and energy crop worldwide. As a 
      core regulator of the salicylic acid (SA) signaling pathway, nonexpressor of
      pathogenesis-related genes 1 (NPR1) plays a significant role in the response of
      the plant to biotic and abiotic stresses. However, there is currently no report
      on the NPR1-like gene family in sugarcane. In this study, a total of 18 NPR1-like
      genes were identified in Saccharum spontaneum and classified into three clades
      (clade I, II, and III). The cis-elements predicted in the promotors revealed that
      the sugarcane NPR1-like genes may be involved in various phytohormones and stress
      responses. RNA sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR analysis demonstrated
      that NPR1-like genes were differentially expressed in sugarcane tissues and under
      Sporisorium scitamineum stress. In addition, a novel ShNPR1 gene from Saccharum
      spp. hybrid ROC22 was isolated by homologous cloning and validated to be a
      nuclear-localized clade II member. The ShNPR1 gene was constitutively expressed
      in all the sugarcane tissues, with the highest expression level in the leaf and
      the lowest in the bud. The expression level of ShNPR1 was decreased by the plant 
      hormones salicylic acid (SA) and abscisic acid (ABA). Additionally, the transient
      expression showed that the ShNPR1 gene plays a positive role in Nicotiana
      benthamiana plants' defense response to Ralstonia solanacearum and Fusarium
      solani var. coeruleum. This study provided comprehensive information for the
      NPR1-like family in sugarcane, which should be helpful for functional
      characterization of sugarcane NPR1-like genes in the future.

TI  - Improving the Therapeutic Index of Smp24, a Venom-Derived Antimicrobial Peptide: 
      Increased Activity against Gram-Negative Bacteria.
LID - 7979 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23147979 [doi]
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are naturally occurring compounds which possess a
      rapid killing mechanism and low resistance potential. Consequently, they are
      being viewed as potential alternatives to traditional antibiotics. One of the
      major factors limiting further development of AMPs is off-target toxicity.
      Enhancements to antimicrobial peptides which can maximise antimicrobial activity 
      whilst reducing mammalian cytotoxicity would make these peptides more attractive 
      as future pharmaceuticals. We have previously characterised Smp24, an AMP derived
      from the venom of the scorpion Scorpio maurus palmatus. This study sought to
      better understand the relationship between the structure, function and bacterial 
      selectivity of this peptide by performing single amino acid substitutions. The
      antimicrobial, haemolytic and cytotoxic activity of modified Smp24 peptides was
      determined. The results of these investigations were compared with the activity
      of native Smp24 to determine which modifications produced enhanced therapeutic
      indices. The structure-function relationship of Smp24 was investigated by
      performing N-terminal, mid-chain and C-terminal amino acid substitutions and
      determining the effect that they had on the antimicrobial and cytotoxic activity 
      of the peptide. Increased charge at the N-, mid- and C-termini of the peptide
      resulted in increased antimicrobial activity. Increased hydrophobicity at the
      N-terminus resulted in reduced haemolysis and cytotoxicity. Reduced
      antimicrobial, haemolytic and cytotoxic activity was observed by increased
      hydrophobicity at the mid-chain. Functional improvements have been made to
      modified peptides when compared with native Smp24, which has produced peptides
      with enhanced therapeutic indices.

LID - 10.3390/ijms23147954 [doi]
AB  - Esterases are broadly expressed in bacteria, but much remains unknown about their
      pathogenic effect. In previous studies, we focused on an esterase secreted by
      Streptococcus&amp;nbsp;pyogenes (group A Streptococcus, GAS). Streptococcal
      secreted esterase (Sse) can hydrolyze the sn-2 ester bonds of platelet-activating
      factor (PAF), converting it to an inactive form that inhibits neutrophil
      chemotaxis to the infection sites. However, as a virulent protein, Sse probably
      participates in GAS pathogenesis far beyond chemotaxis inhibition. In this study,
      we generated the sse gene knockout strain (Deltasse) from the parent strain
      MGAS5005 (hypervirulent M1T1 serotype) and compared the difference in phenotypes.
      Absence of Sse was related to weakened skin invasion in a murine infection model,
      and significantly reduced GAS epithelial adherence, invasion, and intracellular
      survival. Reduced virulence of the Deltasse mutant strain was explored through
      transcriptome analysis, revealing a striking reduction in the abundance of
      invasive virulence factors including M protein, SIC, ScpA, and SclA. Besides the 
      influence on the virulence, Sse also affected carbohydrate, amino acid,
      pyrimidine, and purine metabolism pathways. By elucidating Sse-mediated
      pathogenic process, the study will contribute to the development of new
      therapeutic agents that target bacterial esterases to control clinical GAS
      infections.

TI  - 3'5-Dimaleamylbenzoic Acid Attenuates Bleomycin-Induced Pulmonary Fibrosis in
      Mice.
LID - 7943 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23147943 [doi]
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic lung disease characterized by
      parenchymal scarring, leading progressively to alveolar architecture distortion, 
      respiratory failure, and eventually death. Currently, there is no effective
      treatment for IPF. Previously, 3'5-dimaleamylbenzoic acid (3'5-DMBA), a
      maleimide, demonstrated pro-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer
      properties; however, its potential therapeutic effects on IPF have not been
      addressed. Bleomycin (BLM) 100 U/kg was administered to CD1 mice through an
      osmotic minipump. After fourteen days of BLM administration, 3'5-DMBA (6 mg/kg or
      10 mg/kg) and its vehicle carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) were administered
      intragastrically every two days until day 26. On day 28, all mice were
      euthanized. The 3'5-DMBA effect was assessed by histological and
      immunohistochemical staining, as well as by RT-qPCR. The redox status on lung
      tissue was evaluated by determining the glutathione content and the GSH/GSSG
      ratio. 3'5-DMBA treatment re-established typical lung histological features and
      decreased the expression of BLM-induced fibrotic markers: collagen, alpha-SMA,
      and TGF-beta1. Furthermore, 3'5-DMBA significantly reduced the expression of
      genes involved in fibrogenesis. In addition, it decreased reduced glutathione and
      increased oxidized glutathione content without promoting oxidative damage to
      lipids, as evidenced by the decrease in the lipid peroxidation marker 4-HNE.
      Therefore, 3'5-DMBA may be a promising candidate for IPF treatment.

TI  - Genomewide Identification and Characterization of the Genes Involved in the
      Flowering of Cotton.
LID - 7940 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23147940 [doi]
AB  - Flowering is a prerequisite for flowering plants to complete reproduction, and
      flowering time has an important effect on the high and stable yields of crops.
      However, there are limited reports on flowering-related genes at the genomic
      level in cotton. In this study, genomewide analysis of the evolutionary
      relationship of flowering-related genes in different cotton species shows that
      the numbers of flowering-related genes in the genomes of tetraploid cotton
      species Gossypium hirsutum and Gossypium barbadense were similar, and that these 
      numbers were approximately twice as much as the number in diploid cotton species 
      Gossypium arboretum. The classification of flowering-related genes shows that
      most of them belong to the photoperiod and circadian clock flowering pathway. The
      distribution of flowering-related genes on the chromosomes of the At and Dt
      subgenomes was similar, with no subgenomic preference detected. In addition, most
      of the flowering-related core genes in Arabidopsis thaliana had homologs in the
      cotton genome, but the copy numbers and expression patterns were disparate;
      moreover, flowering-related genes underwent purifying selection throughout the
      evolutionary and selection processes. Although the differentiation and
      reorganization of many key genes of the cotton flowering regulatory network
      occurred throughout the evolutionary and selection processes, most of them,
      especially those involved in the important flowering regulatory networks, have
      been relatively conserved and preferentially selected.

AB  - Endocrine Disrupting Compounds (EDCs) are found in everyday products. Widely
      distributed throughout the environment, persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are 
      a specific class of EDCs that can accumulate in adipose tissue. Many of them
      induce adverse effects on human health-such as obesity, fertility disorders and
      cancers-by perturbing hormone effects. We previously identified many compounds
      with EDC activity in the circulation of obese patients who underwent bariatric
      surgery. Herein, we analyzed the effects of four of them (aldrin, BDE28, PFOA and
      PCB153) on two cancer cell lines of hormone-sensitive organs (prostate and
      breast). Each cell line was exposed to serial dilutions of EDCs from 10(-6) M to 
      10(-12) M; cytotoxicity and proliferation were monitored using the IncuCyte((R)) 
      technology. We showed that none of these EDCs induce cytotoxicity and that PFOA
      and PCB153, only at very low doses (10(-12) M), increase the proliferation of
      DU145 (prostate cancer) and MCF7 (breast cancer) cells, while the same effects
      are observed with high concentrations (10(-6) M) for aldrin or BDE28. Regarding
      the mechanistic aspects, PFOA uses two different signaling pathways between the
      two lines (the Akt/mTORC1 and PlexinD1 in MCF7 and DU145, respectively). Thus,
      our study demonstrates that even at picomolar (10(-12) M) concentrations PFOA and
      PCB153 increase the proliferation of prostate and breast cancer cell lines and
      can be considered possible carcinogens.

AB  - 'Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus' (CLas) is a bacterium that causes
      Huanglongbing, also known as citrus greening, in citrus plants. 'Candidatus
      Liberibacter solanacearum' (Lso) is a close relative of CLas and in the US it
      infects solanaceous crops, causing zebra chip disease in potato. Previously, we
      have identified the Lso hypothetical protein effector 1 (Lso-HPE1). This protein 
      uses a signal peptide for secretion; disrupts programmed cell death; and
      interacts with tomato RAD23c, d, and e proteins, but not with RAD23a. In this
      study, we evaluated whether CLIBASIA_00460, the CLas homolog of Lso-HPE1
      interacted with citrus RAD23 proteins and disrupted their programmed cell death. 
      Based on the yeast two-hybrid assay results, CLIBASIA_00460 interacted with
      citrus RAD23c and RAD23d, but not with citrus RAD23b. These results were
      confirmed using bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays, which showed
      that these interactions occurred in cell puncta, but not in the nucleus or
      cytoplasm. Additionally, CLIBASIA_00460 was able to disrupt the
      Prf(D1416V)-induced hypersensitive response. Therefore, based on the similar
      interactions between Lso-HPE1 and CLIBASIA_00460 with the host RAD23 proteins and
      their ability to inhibit cell death in plants, we propose that these effectors
      may have similar functions during plant infection.

TI  - Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy in Patients with Severe Obesity Restores Adaptive
      Responses Leading to Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis.
LID - 7830 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23147830 [doi]
AB  - The surgically induced remission of liver disease represents a model to
      investigate the signalling processes that trigger the development of nonalcoholic
      steatohepatitis with the aim of identifying novel therapeutic targets. We
      recruited patients with severe obesity with or without nonalcoholic
      steatohepatitis and obtained liver and plasma samples before and after
      laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy for immunoblotting, immunocytochemical,
      metabolomic, transcriptomic and epigenetic analyses. Functional studies were
      performed in HepG2 cells and primary hepatocytes. Surgery was associated with a
      decrease in the inflammatory response and revealed the role of mitogen-activated 
      protein kinases. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis was associated with an increased
      glutaminolysis-induced production of alpha-ketoglutarate and the hyperactivation 
      of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1. These changes were crucial for
      adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase/mammalian target of
      rapamycin-driven pathways that modulated hepatocyte survival by coordinating
      apoptosis and autophagy and affected methylation-related epigenomic remodelling
      enzymes. Hepatic transcriptome signatures and differentially methylated genomic
      regions distinguished patients with and without steatohepatitis. Our results
      suggest that the increased glutaminolysis-induced alpha-ketoglutarate production 
      and the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 dysregulation play a crucial role
      in the inefficient adaptive responses leading to steatohepatitis in obesity.

TI  - In Silico Study of Allosteric Communication Networks in GPCR Signaling Bias.
LID - 7809 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23147809 [doi]
AB  - Signaling bias is a promising characteristic of G protein-coupled receptors
      (GPCRs) as it provides the opportunity to develop more efficacious and safer
      drugs. This is because biased ligands can avoid the activation of pathways linked
      to side effects whilst still producing the desired therapeutic effect. In this
      respect, a deeper understanding of receptor dynamics and implicated allosteric
      communication networks in signaling bias can accelerate the research on novel
      biased drug candidates. In this review, we aim to provide an overview of
      computational methods and techniques for studying allosteric communication and
      signaling bias in GPCRs. This includes (i) the detection of allosteric
      communication networks and (ii) the application of network theory for extracting 
      relevant information pipelines and highly communicated sites in GPCRs. We focus
      on the most recent research and highlight structural insights obtained based on
      the framework of allosteric communication networks and network theory for GPCR
      signaling bias.

TI  - Superhydrophobic Paper-Based Microfluidic Field-Effect Transistor Biosensor
      Functionalized with Semiconducting Single-Walled Carbon Nanotube and DNAzyme for 
      Hypocalcemia Diagnosis.
LID - 7799 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23147799 [doi]
AB  - Hypocalcemia is caused by a sharp decline in blood calcium concentration after
      dairy cow calving, which can lead to various diseases or even death. It is
      necessary to develop an inexpensive, easy-to-operate, reliable sensor to diagnose
      hypocalcemia. The cellulose-paper-based microfluidic field-effect biosensor is
      promising for point-of-care, but it has poor mechanical strength and a short
      service life after exposure to an aqueous solution. Octadecyltrichlorosilane
      (OTS), as a popular organosilane derivative, can improve the hydrophobicity of
      cellulose paper to overcome the shortage of cellulose paper. In this work, OTS
      was used to produce the superhydrophobic cellulose paper that enhances the
      mechanical strength and short service life of MFB, and a microfluidic
      field-effect biosensor (MFB) with semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes
      (SWNTs) and DNAzyme was then developed for the Ca(2+) determination. Pyrene
      carboxylic acid (PCA) attached to SWNTs through a non-covalent pi-pi stacking
      interaction provided a carboxyl group that can bond with an amino group of
      DNAzyme. Two DNAzymes with different sensitivities were designed by changing the 
      sequence length and cleavage site, which were functionalized with SPFET/SWNTs-PCA
      to form Dual-MFB, decreasing the interference of impurities in cow blood. After
      optimizing the detecting parameters, Dual-MFB could determine the Ca(2+)
      concentration in the range of 25 muM to 5 mM, with a detection limit of 10.7 muM.
      The proposed Dual-MFB was applied to measure Ca(2+) concentration in cow blood,
      which provided a new method to diagnose hypocalcemia after dairy cow calving.

TI  - Camellia sinensis Chloroplast Fluoride Efflux Gene CsABCB9 Is Involved in the
      Fluoride Tolerance Mechanism.
LID - 7756 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23147756 [doi]
AB  - Soil is a main source of fluoride for plants. The tea plants (Camellia sinensis) 
      accumulate excessive amounts of fluoride in their leaves compared to other
      plants, but their fluoride tolerance mechanism is poorly understood. A
      chloroplast fluoride efflux gene (CsABCB9) was newly discovered by using
      transcriptome analysis, cloned from Camellia sinensis, and its function was
      demonstrated in the fluoride detoxication mechanism in Escherichia coli/Xenopus
      laevis oocytes and Arabidopsis thaliana. CsABCB9 is expressed in tea leaves upon 
      F(-) treatment. The growth of tea, E. coli, and Arabidopsis were inhibited by
      F(-) treatment. However, growth of CsABCB9-overexpression in E.&amp;nbsp;coli was
      shown to increase with lower fluoride content under F(-) treatment compared to
      the control. Furthermore, chlorophyll, xanthophyll and soluble sugar contents of 
      CsABCB9-overexpression in Arabidopsis were improved under F(-) treatment compared
      to the wild type. CsABCB9 functions in fluoride transport, and the mechanism by
      which CsABCB9 improves fluoride resistance in tea is mainly chloroplast
      protection through fluoride efflux.

LID - 10.3390/ijms23147730 [doi]
AB  - Endotherms are easily challenged by chronic cold stress. In this study, the
      development and injury of the small intestine in the Min pig model and Yorkshire 
      pig model under chronic cold stress, and the molecular mechanisms by which
      glucose supplementation reduces small intestinal mucosal damage were
      investigated. The results showed that morphological structure lesions of the
      jejunal mucosa and ileal mucosa were visible in Yorkshire pigs under chronic cold
      stress. Meanwhile, the Occludin mRNA and protein expression in jejunal mucosa of 
      Yorkshire pigs was decreased. Chronic cold stress enhanced the expression of
      Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), the myeloid differentiation main response 88
      (MyD88), nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat protein 3 (NLRP3),
      cleaved caspase-1, mature-IL-1beta, and high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB 1) mRNA
      and protein expression in jejunal mucosa of Yorkshire pigs, whereas the mRNA and 
      protein of Bax was triggered in ileal mucosa. In Min pigs, no such deleterious
      consequences were observed. Dietary glucose supplementation ameliorates small
      intestinal mucosal injury, declined TLR4 and MyD88 expression in jejunal mucosa. 
      In conclusion, chronic cold stress induced the small intestinal mucosa damage in 
      Yorkshire pigs, whereas glucose supplementation mitigated the deleterious effects
      of chronic cold stress on the small intestine.

TI  - Genome-Wide Identification of Glutathione S-Transferase and Expression Analysis
      in Response to Anthocyanin Transport in the Flesh of the New Teinturier Grape
      Germplasm 'Zhongshan-HongYu'.
LID - 7717 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23147717 [doi]
AB  - Anthocyanins are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum and then transported to
      the vacuole in plants. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are thought to play a
      key role in anthocyanin transport. To clarify the mechanism of GST genes in the
      accumulation and transport of anthocyanin in the early fruit stage, we analyzed
      and characterized the GST family in the flesh of 'Zhongshan-HongYu' (ZS-HY) based
      on the transcriptome. In this study, the 92 GST genes identified through a
      comprehensive bioinformatics analysis were unevenly present in all chromosomes of
      grapes, except chromosomes 3, 9 and 10. Through the analysis of the chromosomal
      location, gene structure, conserved domains, phylogenetic relationships and
      cis-acting elements of GST family genes, the phylogenetic tree divided the GST
      genes into 9 subfamilies. Eighteen GST genes were screened and identified from
      grape berries via a transcriptome sequencing analysis, of which 4 belonged to the
      phi subfamily and 14 to the tau subfamily, and the expression levels of these GST
      genes were not tissue-specific. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that VvGST4
      was closely related to PhAN9 and AtTT19. This study provides a foundation for the
      analysis of the GST gene family and insight into the roles of GSTs in grape
      anthocyanin transport.

AB  - Second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) has been found to regulate
      multiple mitochondrial functions, including respiration, dynamics, reactive
      oxygen species production, cell survival and death through the activation of
      cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) and other effectors. Several members of the
      large family of A kinase anchor proteins (AKAPs) have been previously shown to
      locally amplify cAMP/PKA signaling to mitochondria, promoting the assembly of
      signalosomes, regulating multiple cardiac functions under both physiological and 
      pathological conditions. In this review, we will discuss roles and regulation of 
      major mitochondria-targeted AKAPs, along with opportunities and challenges to
      modulate their functions for translational purposes in the cardiovascular system.

TI  - Anti-Inflammatory Activity of Mulberry Leaf Flavonoids In Vitro and In Vivo.
LID - 7694 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23147694 [doi]
AB  - Mulberry (Morus alba L.) is a flowering tree traditionally used in Chinese herbal
      medicine. Mulberry leaf flavonoids (MLFs) have been reported to exert important
      anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. The purpose of this study was to
      select the MLF with the best anti-inflammatory and antioxidative activities from 
      MLFs eluted by different ethanol concentrations (30%, 50%, and 75%) and explore
      its pharmacological properties. Three types of MLFs inhibited the production of
      nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), inducible nitric oxide synthase
      (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and inflammatory cytokines in
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW 264.7 cells. All MLFs boosted the
      antioxidative capacity by decreasing the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production
      and the scavenging of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radicals and
      improving the metal ion chelating activity and reducing power. The results
      revealed that the MLFs eluted by 30% ethanol exhibited the best anti-inflammatory
      and antioxidative activities. A nontargeted metabolomic analysis was used to
      analyze 24 types of differential flavonoids between the MLFs. Quercetin,
      kaempferol, and their derivatives in 30%MLF were more abundant than the other two
      MLFs. Furthermore, we evaluated the pharmacological activities of 30%MLF in
      dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced ulcerative colitis (UC) mice. The 30%MLF
      could alleviate the clinical symptoms, reduce the secretion of inflammatory
      cytokines, and inhibit the activation of the inflammatory pathway in DSS-induced 
      colitis mice. This study will provide valuable information for the development of
      MLFs eluted by 30% ethanol as a functional food.

TI  - Nucleosome Assembly Protein 1, Nap1, Is Required for the Growth, Development, and
      Pathogenicity of Magnaporthe oryzae.
LID - 7662 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23147662 [doi]
AB  - Magnaporthe oryzae is the causal agent of rice blast, leading to significant
      reductions in rice and wheat productivity. Nap1 is a conserved protein in
      eukaryotes involved in diverse physiological processes, such as nucleosome
      assembly, histone shuttling between the nucleus and cytoplasm, transcriptional
      regulation, and the cell cycle. Here, we identified Nap1 and characterized its
      roles in fungal development and virulence in M. oryzae. MoNap1 is involved in
      aerial hyphal and conidiophore differentiation, sporulation, appressorium
      formation, plant penetration, and virulence. DeltaMonap1 generated a small,
      elongated, and malformed appressorium with an abnormally organized septin ring on
      hydrophobic surfaces. DeltaMonap1 was more sensitive to cell wall integrity
      stresses but more resistant to microtubule stresses. MoNap1 interacted with
      histones H2A and H2B and the B-type cyclin (Cyc1). Moreover, a nuclear export
      signal (NES) domain is necessary for Nap1's roles in the regulation of the growth
      and pathogenicity of M. oryzae. In summary, NAP1 is essential for the growth,
      appressorium formation, and pathogenicity of M. oryzae.

      Activating Different Plant-Immunity Processes against Pseudomonas syringae pv.
      actinidiae.
LID - 7643 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23147643 [doi]
AB  - Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa), a bacterial pathogen, is a severe
      threat to kiwifruit production. To elucidate the species-specific interaction
      between Psa and kiwifruit, transcriptomic-profiles analyses were conducted, under
      Psa-infected treatment and mock-inoculated control, on shoots of resistant Maohua
      (MH) and susceptible Hongyang (HY) kiwifruit varieties. The plant hormone-signal 
      transduction and plant-pathogen interaction were significantly enriched in HY
      compared with MH. However, the starch and sucrose metabolism, antigen processing 
      and presentation, phagosome, and galactose metabolism were significantly enriched
      in MH compared with HY. Interestingly, the MAP2 in the
      pathogen/microbe-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)-triggered immunity (PTI)
      was significantly up-regulated in MH. The genes RAR1, SUGT1, and HSP90A in the
      effector-triggered immunity (ETI), and the NPR1 and TGA genes involved in the
      salicylic acid signaling pathway as regulatory roles of ETI, were significantly
      up-regulated in HY. Other important genes, such as the CCRs involved in
      phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, were highly expressed in MH, but some genes in the 
      Ca(2+) internal flow or involved in the reactive oxygen metabolism were obviously
      expressed in HY. These results suggested that the PTI and cell walls involved in 
      defense mechanisms were significant in MH against Psa infection, while the ETI
      was notable in HY against Psa infection. This study will help to understand
      kiwifruit bacterial canker disease and provide important theoretical support in
      kiwifruit breeding.

TI  - Targeting the Microenvironment for Treating Multiple Myeloma.
LID - 7627 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23147627 [doi]
AB  - Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant, incurable disease characterized by the
      expansion of monoclonal terminally differentiated plasma cells in the bone
      marrow. MM is consistently preceded by an asymptomatic monoclonal gammopathy of
      undetermined significance, and in the absence of myeloma defining events followed
      by a stage termed smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM), which finally progresses to 
      active myeloma if signs of organ damage are present. The reciprocal interaction
      between tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment plays a crucial role in the
      development of MM and the establishment of a tumor-promoting stroma facilitates
      tumor growth and myeloma progression. Since myeloma cells depend on signals from 
      the bone marrow microenvironment (BMME) for their survival, therapeutic
      interventions targeting the BMME are a novel and successful strategy for myeloma 
      care. Here, we describe the complex interplay between myeloma cells and the
      cellular components of the BMME that is essential for MM development and
      progression. Finally, we present BMME modifying treatment options such as
      anti-CD38 based therapies, immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs), CAR T-cell therapies, 
      bispecific antibodies, and antibody-drug conjugates which have significantly
      improved the long-term outcome of myeloma patients, and thus represent novel
      therapeutic standards.

TI  - The Ethylene Response Factor ERF5 Regulates Anthocyanin Biosynthesis in 'Zijin'
      Mulberry Fruits by Interacting with MYBA and F3H Genes.
LID - 7615 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23147615 [doi]
AB  - Ethylene promotes ripening in fruits as well as the biosynthesis of anthocyanins 
      in plants. However, the question of which ethylene response factors (ERFs)
      interact with the genes along the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway is yet to be
      answered. Herein, we conduct an integrated analysis of transcriptomes and
      metabolome on fruits of two mulberry genotypes ('Zijin', ZJ, and 'Dashi', DS,
      with high and low anthocyanin abundance, respectively) at different
      post-flowering stages. In total, 1035 upregulated genes were identified in ZJ and
      DS, including MYBA in the MBW complex and anthocyanin related genes such as F3H. 
      A KEGG analysis suggested that flavonoid biosynthesis and plant hormone signaling
      transduction pathways were significantly enriched in the upregulated gene list.
      In particular, among 103 ERF genes, the expression of ERF5 showed the most
      positive correlation with the anthocyanin change pattern across both genotypes
      and in the post-flowering stages, with a Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) of
      0.93. Electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA) and luciferase assay suggested 
      that ERF5 binds to the promoter regions of MYBA and F3H and transcriptionally
      activates their gene expression. We elucidated a potential mechanism by which
      ethylene enhances anthocyanin accumulation in mulberry fruits and highlighted the
      importance of the ERF5 gene in controlling the anthocyanin content in mulberry
      species. This knowledge could be used for engineering purposes in future mulberry
      breeding programs.

TI  - Integrated mRNA and Small RNA Sequencing Reveals a microRNA Regulatory Network
      Associated with Starch Biosynthesis in Lotus (Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn.) Rhizomes.
LID - 7605 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23147605 [doi]
AB  - Internode starch biosynthesis is one of the most important traits in lotus
      rhizome because of its relation to crop productivity. Understanding the microRNA 
      (miRNA) and mRNA expression profiles related to lotus internode starch
      biosynthesis would help develop molecular improvement strategies, but they are
      not yet well-investigated. To identify genes and miRNAs involved in internode
      starch biosynthesis, the cDNA and small RNA libraries of Z6-1, Z6-2, and Z6-3
      were sequenced, and their expression were further studied. Through combined
      analyses of transcriptome data and small RNA sequencing data, a complex
      co-expression regulatory network was constructed, in which 20 miRNAs could
      modulate starch biosynthesis in different internodes by tuning the expression of 
      10 target genes. QRT-PCR analysis, transient co-expression experiment and dual
      luciferase assay comprehensively confirmed that NnumiR396a down-regulated the
      expression of NnSS2 and ultimately prevents the synthesis of amylopectin, and
      NnumiR396b down-regulated the expression of NnPGM2 and ultimately prevents the
      synthesis of total starch. Our results suggest that miRNAs play a critical role
      in starch biosynthesis in lotus rhizome, and that miRNA-mediated networks could
      modulate starch biosynthesis in this tissue. These results have provided
      important insights into the molecular mechanism of starch biosynthesis in
      developing lotus rhizome.

TI  - Beneficial Effects of Theaflavins on Metabolic Syndrome: From Molecular Evidence 
      to Gut Microbiome.
LID - 7595 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23147595 [doi]
AB  - In recent years, many natural foods and herbs rich in phytochemicals have been
      proposed as health supplements for patients with metabolic syndrome (MetS).
      Theaflavins (TFs) are a polyphenol hydroxyl substance with the structure of
      diphenol ketone, and they have the potential to prevent and treat a wide range of
      MetS. However, the stability and bioavailability of TFs are poor. TFs have the
      marvelous ability to alleviate MetS through antiobesity and lipid-lowering
      (AMPK-FoxO3A-MnSOD, PPAR, AMPK, PI3K/Akt), hypoglycemic (IRS-1/Akt/GLUT4,
      Ca(2+)/CaMKK2-AMPK, SGLT1), and uric-acid-lowering (XO, GLUT9, OAT) effects, and 
      the modulation of the gut microbiota (increasing beneficial gut microbiota such
      as Akkermansia and Prevotella). This paper summarizes and updates the
      bioavailability of TFs, and the available signaling pathways and molecular
      evidence on the functionalities of TFs against metabolic abnormalities in vitro
      and in vivo, representing a promising opportunity to prevent MetS in the future
      with the utilization of TFs.

TI  - Genome-Wide Identification of TaSAUR Gene Family Members in Hexaploid Wheat and
      Functional Characterization of TaSAUR66-5B in Improving Nitrogen Use Efficiency.
LID - 7574 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23147574 [doi]
AB  - Excessive input of nitrogen fertilizer not only causes a great waste of resources
      but brings about a series of ecological and environmental problems. Although
      Small Auxin Up-regulated&amp;nbsp;RNAs (SAURs) participate in diverse biological 
      processes, the function of SAURs in the nitrogen starvation response has not been
      well-studied. Here, we identified 308 TaSAURs in wheat and divided them into 10
      subfamilies. The promoter regions of most TaSAURs contain hormone responsive
      elements, and their expression levels change under the treatment of different
      hormones, such as IAA, MeJA, and ABA. Interestingly, overexpression of one of the
      TaSAUR family members, a nitrogen starvation responsive gene, TaSAUR66-5B, can
      promote the growth of Arabidopsis and wheat roots. In addition, overexpression of
      TaSAUR66-5B in Arabidopsis up-regulates the expression levels of auxin
      biosynthesis related genes, suggesting that overexpression TaSAUR66-5B may
      promote root growth by increasing the biosynthesis of auxin. Furthermore,
      overexpression of TaSAUR66-5B in wheat can increase the biomass and grain yields 
      of transgenic plants, as well as the nitrogen concentration and accumulation of
      both shoots and grains, especially under low nitrogen conditions. This study
      provides important genomic information of the TaSAUR gene family and lays a
      foundation for elucidating the functions of TaSAURs in improving nitrogen
      utilization efficiency in wheat.

LID - 10.3390/ijms23147529 [doi]
AB  - Populus ussuriensis Kom. is a valuable forest regeneration tree species in the
      eastern mountainous region of Northeast China. It is known that diploid P.
      ussuriensis (CK) performed barely satisfactorily under salt stress, but the salt 
      stress tolerance of polyploid (i.e., triploid (T12) and tetraploid (F20)) P.
      ussuriensis is still unknown. In order to compare the salt stress tolerance and
      salt stress response mechanism between diploid and polyploid P. ussuriensis,
      phenotypic observation, biological and biochemistry index detections, and
      transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) were performed on CK, T12, and F20. Phenotypic
      observation and leaf salt injury index analysis indicated CK suffered more severe
      salt injury than T12 and F20. SOD and POD activity detections indicated the salt 
      stress response capacity of T12 was stronger than that of CK and F20. MDA
      content, proline content and relative electric conductivity detections indicated 
      CK suffered the most severe cell-membrane damage, and T12 exhibited the strongest
      osmoprotective capacity under salt stress. Transcriptome analysis indicated the
      DEGs of CK, T12, and F20 under salt stress were different in category and change 
      trend, and there were abundant WRKY, NAM, MYB and AP2/ERF genes among the DEGs in
      CK, T12, and F20 under salt stress. GO term enrichment indicated the basic growth
      progresses of CK, and F20 was obviously influenced, while T12 immediately
      launched more salt stress response processes in 36 h after salt stress. KEGG
      enrichment indicated the DEGs of CK mainly involved in plant-pathogen
      interaction, ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes, protein processing in endoplasmic
      reticulum, degradation of aromatic compounds, plant hormone signal transduction, 
      photosynthesis, and carbon metabolism pathways. The DEGs of T12 were mainly
      involved in plant-pathogen interaction, cysteine and methionine metabolism,
      phagosomes, biosynthesis of amino acids, phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan
      biosynthesis, plant hormone signal transduction, and starch and sucrose
      metabolism pathways. The DEGs of F20 were mainly involved in plant hormone signal
      transduction, plant-pathogen interaction, zeatin biosynthesis, and glutathione
      metabolism pathways. In conclusion, triploid exhibited stronger salt stress
      tolerance than tetraploid and diploid P. ussuriensis (i.e., T12 &gt; F20 &gt;
      CK). The differences between the DEGs of CK, T12, and F20 probably are the key
      clues for discovering the salt stress response signal transduction network in P. 
      Ussuriensis.

AB  - Mosquito repellents reduce human-vector contact of vector-borne diseases. We
      compared the repellent activity of 10 undiluted essential oils (anise, basil,
      bergamot, coriander, patchouli, peppermint, petitgrain, rosemary, sage and
      vetiver) against A. aegypti,&amp;nbsp;A. dirus and C. quinquefasciatus using the 
      arm-in-cage method. Petitgrain oil was the most effective against A. aegypti (270
      min). Peppermint oil was the most effective against A. dirus (180 min).
      Interestingly, all single oils had attributes of repellency against C.
      quinquefasciatus (ranged, 120-360 min). Moreover, we integrated their binary
      combinations of highly effective essential oils against A. aegypti and A. dirus
      to potentially increase the protection time. A 1:1 combination of
      petitgrain/basil, petitgrain/coriander, basil/coriander and basil/sage reduced
      the median complete-protection time of 150 min for A. aegypti; a combination of
      sage and patchouli oils prolonged the median complete-protection time of 270 min 
      for A. dirus. Combining essential oils effect protection time from these two
      mosquito species.

      Venation.
LID - 654 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/insects13070654 [doi]
AB  - The species and morphological diversity of dustywings (Neuroptera:
      Coniopterygidae) from the Cretaceous, of which the knowledge is rapidly
      increasing by recent studies on the species from the mid-Cretaceous Kachin amber,
      provide valuable evidence for understanding the phylogeny and early evolution of 
      this highly specialized lacewing lineage. Here we describe a new genus and two
      new species of this genus in Coniopterygidae from the mid-Cretaceous (lowermost
      Cenomanian) of northern Myanmar, namely Paradoxoconis szirakii&amp;nbsp;gen. et
      sp. nov. and Paradoxoconis longipalpa&amp;nbsp;gen. et sp. nov. The new genus
      possesses a peculiar combination of wing characters, e.g., the terminal fusion or
      connection between ScP and RA, the terminal connection of RA to RP, the presence 
      of forewing A3, and the presence of a distal gradate series of crossveins.
      Despite uncertain subfamilial placement, this new genus morphologically resembles
      the extant genus Coniocompsa Enderlein, 1905 of the subfamily Aleuropteryginae
      and the extant genus Flintoconis Sziraki, 2007 of the subfamily Brucheiserinae.
      Our finding highlights the palaeodiversity of dustywings from the Cretaceous.

TI  - Vast Gene Flow among the Spanish Populations of the Pest Bactrocera oleae

      Its Mediterranean Genetic Context.
LID - 642 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/insects13070642 [doi]
AB  - Spain is the leading producer of olives and olive oil. Ninety-five percent of
      world production originate from Spain and other regions of the Mediterranean
      Basin. However, these olive-growing countries face a major problem, the harmful
      fly Bactrocera oleae, the main pest of olive crops. To improve its control, one
      of the challenges is the further knowledge of the species and populations
      dynamics in this area. A phylogeographic work is necessary to further
      characterise the levels and distribution patterns of genetic diversity of the
      Spanish populations and their genetic relationships with other Mediterranean
      populations. A 1151 bp fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I
      (COI) gene has been analysed in over 250 specimens of the six main Mediterranean 
      countries via sequencing. Genetic diversity parameters were high; 51 new
      haplotypes have been identified showing a geographical pattern across the
      Mediterranean area. The data revealed that olive fruit fly populations have been 
      long time established in the Mediterranean Basin with two genetic groups. Gene
      flow seems to be the main process in shaping this genetic structure as well as
      fly's colonisation routes that have paralleled those of the olive tree.

TI  - Combined Effects of Soil Silicon and Host Plant Resistance on Planthoppers, Blast
      and Bacterial Blight in Tropical Rice.
LID - 604 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/insects13070604 [doi]
AB  - Soil silicon enhances rice defenses against a range of biotic stresses. However, 
      the magnitude of these effects can depend on the nature of the rice variety. We
      conducted a series of greenhouse experiments to examine the effects of silicon on
      planthoppers (Nilaparvata lugens [BPH] and Sogatella furcifera [WBPH]), a
      leafhopper (Nephotettix virescens [GLH]), blast disease (Magnaporthe grisea) and 
      bacterial blight (Xanthomonas oryzae) in susceptible and resistant rice. We added
      powdered silica gel (SiO2) to paddy soil at equivalent to 0.25, 1.0, and 4.0 t
      ha(-1). Added silicon reduced BPH nymph settling, but the effect was negligible
      under high nitrogen. In a choice experiment, BPH egg-laying was lower than
      untreated controls under all silicon treatments regardless of nitrogen or
      variety, whereas, in a no-choice experiment, silicon reduced egg-laying on the
      susceptible but not the resistant (BPH32 gene) variety. Stronger effects in
      choice experiments suggest that silicon mainly enhanced antixenosis defenses. We 
      found no effects of silicon on WBPH or GLH. Silicon reduced blast damage to
      susceptible and resistant (Piz, Piz-5 and Pi9 genes) rice. Silicon reduced damage
      from a virulent strain of bacterial blight but had little effect on a less
      virulent strain in susceptible and resistant (Xa4, Xa7 and Xa4 + Xa7 genes)
      varieties. When combined with resistance, silicon had an additive effect in
      reducing biomass losses to plants infested with bacterial blight (resistance up
      to 50%; silicon 20%). We discuss how silicon-containing soil amendments can be
      combined with host resistance to reduce biotic stresses in rice.

TI  - Larval Crowding Did Not Enhance Adult Migration Propensity in Spodoptera
      frugiperda.
LID - 581 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/insects13070581 [doi]
AB  - Reproduction and flight are two major adaptive strategies to cope with
      environmental stress in migratory insects. However, research on density-mediated 
      flight and reproduction in the global migratory agricultural pest Spodoptera
      frugiperda is lacking. In this study, flight and reproductive performances in
      response to larval crowding were investigated in S. frugiperda. We found that
      larval crowding significantly reduced the pupal and body weights of S.
      frugiperda. Adults reared under the highest density of 30 larvae/jar had the
      minimum wing expansion, which was significantly smaller than that of larvae
      reared under solitary conditions. Larval crowding also significantly increased
      the pre-oviposition period (POP) and period of first oviposition (PFO) but
      decreased the lifetime fecundity, flight duration and flight distance. Our
      results showed that S. frugiperda reared under solitary conditions exhibited
      higher pupal and body weights and stronger reproductive and flight capacities
      than those reared under high-density conditions. Larval crowding did not enhance 
      the migration propensity in S. frugiperda adults. In conclusion, larval crowding 
      may not be a major factor affecting FAW migration due to high levels of
      cannibalism. These findings provide new insights into the population dynamics of 
      S. frugiperda under larval crowding conditions.

TI  - To Every Thing There Is a Season: Phenology and Photoperiodic Control of Seasonal
      Development in the Invasive Caucasian Population of the Brown Marmorated Stink
      Bug, Halyomorpha halys (Hemiptera: Heteroptera: Pentatomidae).
LID - 580 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/insects13070580 [doi]
AB  - Studies on the phenology of local populations of invasive insects are necessary
      for monitoring and predicting their dispersion. We investigated the phenology of 
      the brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys, in the Sochi region (Krasnodar
      Territory, Russia) from 2018 to 2021 by regular field sampling and dissecting.
      The results of the sampling suggest that H.&amp;nbsp;halys is at least partially 
      bivoltine in the studied region: the main period of mass oviposition (by the
      overwintered females) occurs from June to July; the second, much shorter period
      of egg-laying (by females of the new, i.e., the first generation) occurs in
      August. Reproductively active individuals (i.e., females with developed ovaries
      and filled spermatheca and males with filled ectodermal sac) were recorded from
      the end of May to the beginning of September. Such a seasonal pattern correlated 
      with day length: when the natural photoperiod decreased below the experimentally 
      determined critical day length (15.0-15.5 h), the proportions of females with
      fully developed ovaries sharply dropped to zero. Both the rate of H. halys
      pre-adult development and the timing of the induction of winter adult diapause
      observed under natural conditions fully agreed with the earlier predictions that 
      had been based on the results of laboratory experiments.

TI  - Derivation of Soil Criteria of Cadmium for Safe Rice Production Applying
      Soil-Plant Transfer Model and Species Sensitivity Distribution.
LID - 8854 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19148854 [doi]
AB  - Widespread soil contamination is hazardous to agricultural products, posing
      harmful effects on human health through the food chain. In China, Cadmium (Cd) is
      the primary contaminant in soils and easily accumulates in rice, the main food
      for the Chinese population. Therefore, it is essential to derive soil criteria to
      safeguard rice products by assessing Cd intake risk through the soil-grain-human 
      pathway. Based on a 2-year field investigation, a total of 328 soil-rice grain
      paired samples were collected in China, covering a wide variation in soil Cd
      concentrations and physicochemical properties. Two probabilistic methods used to 
      derive soil criteria are soil-plant transfer models (SPT), with predictive
      intervals, and species sensitivity distribution (SSD), composed of soil
      type-specific bioconcentration factor (BCF, Cd concentration ratio in rice grain 
      to soil). The soil criteria were back-calculated from the Chinese food quality
      standard. The results suggested that field data with a proper Cd concentration
      gradient could increase the model accuracy in the soil-plant transfer system. The
      derived soil criteria based on soil pH were 0.06-0.11, 0.33-0.59, and 1.51-2.82
      mg kg(-1) for protecting 95%, 50% and 5% of the rice safety, respectively. The
      soil criteria with soil pH further validated the soil as being safe for rice
      grains.

AB  - In response to global efforts to control and exterminate infectious diseases,
      this study aims to provide insight into the productivity of remdesivir research
      and highlight future directions. To achieve this, there is a need to summarize
      and curate evidence from the literature. As a result, this study carried out
      comprehensive scientific research to detect trends in published articles related 
      to remdesivir using a bibliometric analysis. Keywords associated with remdesivir 
      were used to access pertinent published articles using the Scopus database. A
      total of 5321 research documents were retrieved, primarily as novel research
      articles (n = 2440; 46%). The number of publications increased exponentially from
      2020 up to the present. The papers published by the top 12 institutions focusing 
      on remdesivir accounted for 25.69% of the overall number of articles. The USA
      ranked as the most productive country, with 906 documents (37.1%), equivalent to 
      one-third of the global publications in this field. The most productive
      institution was Icahn School of Medicine, Mount Sinai, in the USA (103
      publications). The New England Journal of Medicine was the most cited, with an
      h-index of 13. The publication of research on remdesivir has gained momentum in
      the past year. The importance of remdesivir suggests that it needs continued
      research to help global health organizations detect areas requiring instant
      action to implement suitable measures. Furthermore, this study offers evolving
      hotspots and valuable insights into the scientific advances in this field and
      provides scaling-up analysis and evidence diffusion on remdesivir.

TI  - The Effects of Self-Perceived Parenting Attitudes on Visuo-Spatial Attention and 
      Mental Rotation Abilities among Adolescents.
LID - 8841 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19148841 [doi]
AB  - The present study aimed to investigate the effect of adolescents' perceived
      negative evaluation of parenting on their visuo-spatial attention and mental
      rotation abilities. The useful field of view (UFOV) and mental rotation tasks
      were used to measure visuo-spatial attention and mental rotation abilities among 
      adolescents. The experimental groups were divided into the negatively evaluating 
      group (MAge = 18.44, SD = 0.87, 20.7% girls) and positively evaluating group
      (MAge = 18.40, SD = 0.81, 23.3% girls) based on their scores on the
      self-perceived parenting attitude scales. The UFOV task showed lesser accuracy of
      the negatively evaluating group when compared to the positively evaluating one in
      target perception presented in 20 degrees visual angle, indicating a deteriorated
      visuo-spatial attention ability in the negatively evaluating group. In the mental
      rotation task, the negatively evaluating group exhibited a small trade-off effect
      between response times and rotation angles, which implied an impatient strategy
      was employed to perform the task, whereas such a trade-off was not observed in
      the positively evaluating group. Thus, both experimental groups differed in terms
      of their visual attention and mental spatial abilities. This study suggests that 
      the reduced visuo-spatial attention and mental rotation abilities may act as
      precursors for serious psychological symptoms caused by the negative
      self-evaluation of their parents' parenting attitudes.

TI  - Research on Determining the Critical Influencing Factors of Carbon Emission
      Integrating GRA with an Improved STIRPAT Model: Taking the Yangtze River Delta as
      an Example.
LID - 8791 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19148791 [doi]
AB  - Driven by China's peak carbon emissions and carbon neutrality goals, each region 
      should choose a suitable local implementation path according to local conditions,
      so it is of great significance to mine and analyze the critical influencing
      factors of regional carbon emissions. Therefore, this paper integrates grey
      relation analysis (GRA) and an improved STIRPAT model and selects the Yangtze
      River Delta region of China as the research object to analyze the factors
      affecting carbon emissions in four provinces in the region. Firstly, it uses the 
      IPCC method to calculate the energy carbon emissions of each province. Secondly, 
      according to the existing research, the relevant influencing factors of carbon
      emissions are sorted and summarized as candidate sets and this paper uses GRA to 
      calculate the correlation degree of the above candidate sets. On this basis, this
      paper combines with the characteristics of the improved STIRPAT model to
      determine the index selection criteria and filter out the critical factors of
      each province. Thirdly, an improved STIRPAT model is constructed for each
      province to explore the influence of critical factors and analyze the influencing
      factors of carbon emissions in detail. The empirical results show that during the
      period from 2005 to 2019, the carbon emissions of the four provinces in the
      Yangtze River Delta are significantly different in structure and trend. At the
      same time, the critical influencing factors of each province are different and
      the influence of the same factor on different regions is significantly different.
      Finally, the policy suggestions for the provinces to achieve their peak carbon
      emissions and carbon neutrality goals are precisely tailored to the different
      carbon emission influencing factors.

TI  - Prevalence, Management, and Associated Factors of Obesity, Hypertension, and
      Diabetes in Tibetan Population Compared with China Overall.
LID - 8787 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19148787 [doi]
AB  - Tibetans' life expectancy lags behind China's average. Obesity and
      noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) contribute to health disparity, but NCD patterns 
      among Tibetans are unknown. To examine the prevalence, management, and associated
      factors for obesity, hypertension, and diabetes among Tibetans, compared with
      China's average, we systematically searched PubMed and China National Knowledge
      Infrastructure databases for studies between January 2010 and April 2021.
      Thirty-nine studies were included for systematic review, among thirty-seven that 
      qualified for meta-analysis, with 115,403 participants. Pooled prevalence was
      47.9% (95% CI 38.0-57.8) for overweight/obesity among adults (BMI >/= 24 kg/m(2))
      and 15.4% (13.7-17.2) among children using Chinese criteria, which are lower than
      the national rates of 51.2% and 19.0%, respectively. The estimate for
      hypertension (31.4% [27.1-35.7]) exceeded China's average (27.5%), while diabetes
      (7.5% [5.2-9.8]) was lower than average (11.9%). Men had a higher prevalence of
      the three conditions than women. Residents in urban areas, rural areas, and
      Buddhist institutes had monotonically decreased prevalence in hypertension and
      diabetes. Awareness, treatment, and control rates for hypertension and diabetes
      were lower than China's average. Urban residence and high altitude were
      consistent risk factors for hypertension. Limited studies investigated factors
      for diabetes, yet none exist for obesity. Tibetans have high burdens of obesity
      and hypertension. Representative and longitudinal studies are needed for tailored
      interventions. There are considerable variations in study design, study sample
      selection, and data-analysis methods, as well as estimates of reviewed studies.

TI  - Multi-Agent Evolutionary Game in the Recycling Utilization of Sulfate-Rich
      Wastewater.
LID - 8770 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19148770 [doi]
AB  - Current industrial development has led to an increase in sulfate-rich industrial 
      sewage, threatening industrial ecology and the environment. Incorrectly treating 
      high-concentration sulfate wastewater can cause serious environmental problems
      and even harm human health. Water with high sulfate levels can be treated as a
      resource and treated harmlessly to meet the needs of the circular economy. Today,
      governments worldwide are working hard to encourage the safe disposal and reuse
      of industrial salt-rich wastewater by recycling sulfate-rich wastewater (SRW)
      resources. However, the conflict of interests between the SRW production
      department, the SRW recycling department, and the governments often make it
      challenging to effectively manage sulfate-rich wastewater resources. This study
      aims to use the mechanism of evolutionary game theory (EGT) to conduct
      theoretical modelling and simulation analysis on the interaction of the behaviour
      of the above three participants. This paper focuses on the impact of government
      intervention and the ecological behaviour of wastewater producers on the
      behavioural decisions of recyclers. The results suggest that the government
      should play a leading role in developing the SRW resource recovery industry. SRW 
      producers protect the environment in the mature stage, and recyclers actively
      collect and recover compliant sulfate wastewater resources. Governments should
      gradually deregulate and eventually withdraw from the market. Qualified recyclers
      and environmentally friendly wastewater producers can benefit from a mature SRW
      resources recovery industry.

TI  - Location-Allocation Model to Improve the Distribution of COVID-19 Vaccine Centers
      in Jeddah City, Saudi Arabia.
LID - 8755 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19148755 [doi]
AB  - The correct distribution of service facilities can help keep fixed and overhead
      costs low while increasing accessibility. When an appropriate location is chosen,
      public-sector facilities, such as COVID-19 centers, can save lives faster and
      provide high-quality service to the community at a low cost. The purpose of the
      research is to highlight the issues related to the location of COVID-19 vaccine
      centers in the city of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. In particular, this paper aims to
      analyze the accessibility of COVID-19 vaccine centers in Jeddah city using
      maximal coverage location problems with and without constraint on the number and 
      capacity of facilities. A maximal coverage model is first used to analyze the
      COVID-19 vaccination coverage of Jeddah districts with no restriction on the
      facility capacity. Then, a maximize capacitated coverage method is utilized to
      assess the centers' distribution and demand coverage with capacity constraints.
      Finally, the minimize facilities model is used to identify the most optimal
      location required to satisfy all demand points with the least number of
      facilities. The optimization approaches consider the objective function of
      minimizing the overall transportation time and travel distance to reduce wastage 
      on the service rate provided to the patients. The optimization model is applied
      to a real-world case study in the context of the COVID-19 vaccination center in
      Jeddah. The results of this study provide valuable information that can help
      decision-makers locate and relocate COVID-19 centers more effectively under
      different constraints conditions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: this study aimed to conduct a biological assessment of the potential 
      exposure to carcinogenic substances in current semiconductor workers. METHODS: A 
      cross-sectional study was conducted on 306 semiconductor workers. The assessed
      biomarkers were as follows: (benzene) urine S-phenylmercapturic,
      trans,trans-muconic acid, blood benzene; (trichloroethylene) urine
      trichloroacetic acid; (2-ethoxyethanol) 2-ethoxyacetic acid; (arsine) urine
      arsenic3+, arsenic5+, monomethylarsonic, dimethylarsinic acid, arsenobetaine;
      (shift work) 6-hydroxymelatonin; (smoking) cotinine, and (radiation). The
      detection rate of these materials is defined as more than the biological exposure
      index (BEI) or the previous reference value. RESULTS: Some workers exposed to
      trans,trans-muconic acid, trichloroacetic acid, and arsenic5+ showed high BEI
      levels. Generally, there was no difference according to job categories, and
      workers were suspected to be exposed to other sources. The melatonin
      concentration tended to decrease when working at night, and cotinine was
      identified as an excellent surrogate marker for smoking. In the case of radiation
      exposure, there was no significant difference in the number of stable chromosome 
      translocation in 19 semiconductor workers. Their estimated radiation exposure
      level was below the limit of detection (LOD) or near the LOD level. CONCLUSION:
      In this study, most carcinogens were below the BEI level, but verification
      through re-measurement was needed for workers who were identified to have a high 
      BEI level. For continuous monitoring, a prospective cohort is necessary to deal
      with the healthy worker effect and assess additional materials.

TI  - Study on the Optimization and Oxygen-Enrichment Effect of Ventilation Scheme in a
      Blind Heading of Plateau Mine.

LID - 10.3390/ijerph19148717 [doi]
AB  - There are abundant mineral resources in plateau areas, but it is difficult to
      extract them safely because the problem of hypoxia in plateau mines seriously
      affects the life and health of workers. In order to address the problem of
      hypoxia in the blind heading of a plateau metal mine, a three-dimensional roadway
      model was established based on field data of the Pulang copper mine in Yunnan
      province, China. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method was used to
      explore the optimal type of oxygen supply duct outlet, and to reveal the oxygen
      diffusion law influencing different ventilation factors. Grey correlation
      analysis was used to study the correlation values of the ventilation factors on
      the oxygen-enrichment effect in blind headings, such as forcing duct position,
      exhausting duct position, and extraction pressure ratio. The results demonstrated
      that the oxygen-enrichment effect of a slit oxygen outlet was better than that of
      the traditional oxygen supply method. When the direction of the oxygen outlet
      hole was 30 degrees and the height above the roadway floor was 1.95 m, the oxygen
      increase effect was better than other forms of oxygen supply duct outlets. Grey
      correlation analysis revealed that the major influencing factors of the
      oxygen-enrichment effect in the roadway of the plateau mine, were, in descending 
      order, as follows: forcing duct position, extraction pressure ratio, and
      exhausting duct position. This study has a positive guiding significance for
      improving the respiration environment in blind headings of plateau mines.

      Case Study in Yangtze River Delta of China.
LID - 8702 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19148702 [doi]
AB  - Green agricultural science and technology progress (GASTP) plays an important
      role in the green transformation of agriculture. This study calculates the
      contribution rate of GASTP by using the Super-SBM model in the Yangtze River
      Delta (YRD) from 2011 to 2020. The exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA)
      method and the Fixed Effect (FE) panel data model method were adopted to
      empirically analyze the spatio-temporal patterns of GASTP and its driving
      mechanism in the YRD. The results showed that: (i) except for Shanghai from 2011 
      to 2015, the contribution rate of GASTP in the YRD was generally lower than 1 in 
      Anhui Province, Jiangsu Province, and Zhejiang Province, (ii) the level of GASTP 
      had a positive spatial correlation with the study period, except for 2017, and
      (iii) per capita GDP, agricultural mechanization level, agricultural financial
      support, and planting structure are four influencing factors of GASTP in the YRD,
      while total retail sales of social consumer goods and total exports did not have 
      significant effects on GASTP in the YRD. Therefore, we need to increase the
      opportunities to exchange GASTP experience between cities, improve the
      environment for agricultural technology extension, and develop follow-up
      monitoring mechanisms.

TI  - Exposure to Traffic Density during Pregnancy and Birth Weight in a National
      Cohort, 2000-2017.
LID - 8611 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19148611 [doi]
AB  - The variation on birth weight is associated with several outcomes early on in
      life and low birth weight (LBW) increases the risk of morbidity and mortality.
      Some environmental exposures during pregnancy, such as particulate matters and
      other traffic-related pollutants can have a significant effect on pregnant women 
      and fetuses. The aim of this study is to estimate the effect of exposure to
      traffic density during pregnancy over birth weight in Spain, from 2000-2017. This
      was a retrospective, cross-sectional study using the information from Spain Birth
      Registry Statistics database. The traffic density was measured using the Annual
      average daily traffic. Multivariate linear regression models using birth weight
      and traffic density were performed, as well as a logistic regression model to
      estimated Odds ratios for LBW and GAM models to evaluate the non-linear effect.
      Our findings showed that increases in traffic density were associated with
      reduction of birth weight and increases of LBW risk. Moreover, exposure to high
      and very-high traffic-density during pregnancy were associated with reduction of 
      birth weight and increase on LBW risk comparing with exposure to low number of
      cars trespassing the neighborhoods. The results of this study agree with previous
      literature and highlights the need of effective policies for reducing traffic
      density in residential neighborhoods of cities and towns.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Distribution Characteristics and Potential Risks of
      Sulfonamides in the Shaanxi Section of the Weihe River.
LID - 8607 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19148607 [doi]
AB  - The hazards of antibiotics as emerging contaminants to aquatic ecosystems and
      human health have received global attention. This study investigates the
      presence, concentration levels, spatial and temporal distribution patterns, and
      their potential risks to aquatic organisms and human health of sulfonamides (SAs)
      in the Shaanxi section of the Weihe River. The SA pollution in the Weihe River
      was relatively less than that in other rivers in China and abroad. The spatial
      and temporal distribution showed that the total concentrations of SAs in the
      Weihe River were highest in the main stream (ND-35.296 ng/L), followed by the
      south tributary (3.718-34.354 ng/L) and north tributary (5.476-9.302 ng/L) during
      the wet water period. Similarly, the order of concentration from highest to
      lowest during the flat water period was main stream (ND-3 ng/L), north tributary 
      (ND-2.095 ng/L), and south tributary (ND-1.3 ng/L). In addition, the ecological
      risk assessment showed that the SAs other than sulfadiazine (SDZ) and
      sulfamethoxazole (SMZ) posed no significant risk (RQS &lt; 0.01) to the
      corresponding sensitive species during both periods, with no significant risk to 
      human health for different age groups, as suggested by the health risk
      assessment. The risk of the six SAs to both aquatic organisms and human health
      decreased significantly from 2016 to 2021.

TI  - Development of a Quantitative Preference Instrument for Person-Centered Dementia 
      Care-Stage 2: Insights from a Formative Qualitative Study to Design and Pretest a
      Dementia-Friendly Analytic Hierarchy Process Survey.
LID - 8554 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19148554 [doi]
AB  - Person-centered care (PCC) requires knowledge about patient preferences. An
      analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is one approach to quantify, weigh and rank
      patient preferences suitable for People living with Dementia (PlwD), due to
      simple pairwise comparisons of individual criteria from a complex decision
      problem. The objective of the present study was to design and pretest a
      dementia-friendly AHP survey. Methods: Two expert panels consisting of n = 4
      Dementia Care Managers and n = 4 physicians to ensure content-validity, and
      "thinking-aloud" interviews with n = 11 PlwD and n = 3 family caregivers to
      ensure the face validity of the AHP survey. Following a semi-structured interview
      guide, PlwD were asked to assess appropriateness and comprehensibility. Data,
      field notes and partial interview transcripts were analyzed with a constant
      comparative approach, and feedback was incorporated continuously until PlwD had
      no further comments or struggles with survey completion. Consistency ratios (CRs)
      were calculated with Microsoft((R)) Excel and ExpertChoice Comparion((R)).
      Results: Three main categories with sub-categories emerged: (1) Content: clear
      task introduction, (sub)criteria description, criteria homogeneity, (sub)criteria
      appropriateness, retest questions and sociodemography for heterogeneity; (2)
      Format: survey structure, pairwise comparison sequence, survey length, graphical 
      design (incl. AHP scale), survey procedure explanation, survey assistance and
      response perspective; and (3) Layout: easy wording, short sentences and visual
      aids. Individual CRs ranged from 0.08 to 0.859, and the consolidated CR was 0.37 
      (0.038). Conclusions: Our formative qualitative study provides initial data for
      the design of a dementia-friendly AHP survey. Consideration of our findings may
      contribute to face and content validity in future quantitative preference
      research in dementia.

TI  - A Case Study of Refined Building Climate Zoning under Complicated Terrain
      Conditions in China.
LID - 8530 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19148530 [doi]
AB  - In this study, we first found that the few and sparse meteorological stations
      used in earlier comprehensive studies of building climate zoning in a complicated
      terrain area like Chongqing, China, may lead to the inapplicability of building
      energy efficiency standards in some areas. To address this issue, the study used 
      daily data from 1908 extremely dense surface meteorological stations from 2011 to
      2020 in Chongqing, China. In order to conduct fine zoning of building climate in 
      Chongqing, China, GB50176-2016 and ASHRAE standard 169-2021 were employed,
      respectively. The findings indicated that by using the ASHRAE standard, the
      entire Chongqing region was classified into five climate zones. The Chongqing
      region was categorized into three different climate zones using China
      GB50176-2016: cold zone (CZ), hot summer and cold winter zone (HSCWZ), and mild
      zone (MZ). Not to be overlooked is the MZ (China's GB50176-2016)/mixed-humid zone
      (ASHRAE standard), which is primarily situated at higher elevations in the
      southeast and northeast of Chongqing. In comparison to the HSCWZ/warm-humid zone,
      these zones have drastically different building energy efficiency regulations and
      approaches. According to preliminary projections, improved building climate
      zoning will to some extent increase building energy efficiency and reduce
      emissions in Chongqing. Finally, this study case can be replicated in different
      regions with complicated terrain.

TI  - The Influence of Artificial Light at Night on Asthma and Allergy, Mental Health, 
      and Cancer Outcomes: A Systematic Scoping Review Protocol.
LID - 8522 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19148522 [doi]
AB  - Artificial light at night (ALAN) exposure is associated with the disruption of
      human circadian processes. Through numerous pathophysiological mechanisms such as
      melatonin dysregulation, it is hypothesised that ALAN exposure is involved in
      asthma and allergy, mental illness, and cancer outcomes. There are numerous
      existing studies considering these relationships; however, a critical appraisal
      of available evidence on health outcomes has not been completed. Due to the
      prevalence of ALAN exposure and these outcomes in society, it is critical that
      current evidence of their association is understood. Therefore, this systematic
      scoping review will aim to assess the association between ALAN exposure and
      asthma and allergy, mental health, and cancer outcomes. This systematic scoping
      review will be conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for
      Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. We will search bibliographic
      databases, registries, and references. We will include studies that have
      described potential sources of ALAN exposure (such as shift work or indoor and
      outdoor exposure to artificial light); have demonstrated associations with either
      allergic conditions (including asthma), mental health, or cancer-related
      outcomes; and are published in English in peer-reviewed journals. We will conduct
      a comprehensive literature search, title and abstract screening, full-text
      review, and data collection and analysis for each outcome separately.

TI  - Experiences of Newly Diagnosed Oral Cancer Patients during the First Wave of the 
      COVID-19 Pandemic: A Qualitative Study from Pakistan.
LID - 8508 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19148508 [doi]
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the scaling back or postponement of
      non-emergency hospital services, including care of cancer patients. The present
      qualitative study explored the experiences of newly diagnosed oral cancer
      patients during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Pakistan. Patients who
      attended the Department of Maxillofacial Surgery, Khyber College of Dentistry in 
      July 2020 were selected using a maximum variation purposive sampling method.
      Seventeen semi-structured interviews were conducted in Pashto, the local language
      of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. All interviews were audiotaped, transcribed verbatim, and 
      translated into English. Thematic content analysis yielded eight major themes:
      pain and generalised physical weakness, shock at diagnosis, psychological
      distress of the COVID-19 pandemic, faith and religion, double hit loss of
      employment, social isolation, social support from caregivers, and lack of support
      from health care professionals. In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic has a clear 
      impact on the life experiences of newly diagnosed oral cancer patients. Distress 
      due to delay in accessing health care and lack of support from health care
      providers are a matter of great concern. Appropriate interventions should be
      introduced to ensure psychological and social support strategies are in place for
      patients during interruptions of health care services.

TI  - Hourly Seamless Surface O3 Estimates by Integrating the Chemical Transport and
      Machine Learning Models in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region.
LID - 8511 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19148511 [doi]
AB  - Surface ozone (O3) is an important atmospheric trace gas, posing an enormous
      threat to ecological security and human health. Currently, the core objective of 
      air pollution control in China is to realize the joint treatment of fine
      particulate matter (PM2.5) and O3. However, high-accuracy near-surface O3 maps
      remain lacking. Therefore, we established a new model to determine the
      full-coverage hourly O3 concentration with the WRF-Chem and random forest (RF)
      models combined with anthropogenic emission data and meteorological datasets.
      Based on this method, choosing the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region in 2018 as 
      an example, full-coverage hourly O3 maps were generated at a horizontal
      resolution of 9 km. The performance evaluation results indicated that the new
      model is reliable with a sample (station)-based 10-fold cross-validation (10-CV) 
      R(2) value of 0.94 (0.90) and root mean square error (RMSE) of 14.58 (19.18)
      microg m(-3). In addition, the estimated O3 concentration is accurately
      determined at varying temporal scales with sample-based 10-CV R(2) values of
      0.96, 0.98 and 0.98 at the daily, monthly, and seasonal scales, respectively,
      which is highly superior to traditional derivation algorithms and other
      techniques in previous studies. An initial increase and subsequent decrease,
      which constitute the diurnal variation in the O3 concentration associated with
      temperature and solar radiation variations, were captured. The highest
      concentration reached approximately 112.73 +/- 9.65 mug m(-3) at 15:00 local time
      (1500 LT) in the BTH region. Summertime O3 posed a high pollution risk across the
      whole BTH region, especially in southern cities, and the pollution duration
      accounted for more than 50% of the summer season. Additionally, 43 and two days
      exhibited light and moderate O3 pollution, respectively, across the BTH region in
      2018. Overall, the new method can be beneficial for near-surface O3 estimation
      with a high spatiotemporal resolution, which can be valuable for research in
      related fields.

TI  - Re-Visiting Maximal Heart Rate Prediction Using Cross-Validation in Population
      Aged 7-55 Years.
LID - 8509 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19148509 [doi]
AB  - The primary purpose of the present study was to re-visit HRmax prediction by two 
      commonly used equations (i.e., Fox's and Tanaka's equation) compared to the
      direct measured HRmax using the large sample size of Asians. The second aim of
      the study was to focus on suggesting new equations for the Asian population by
      separating gender and specific age groups. A total of 672 participants aged from 
      7 to 55 years were recruited for the study (male: 280 and female: 392), and the
      maximal graded exercise test with Bruce protocol was used to measure HRmax. All
      data obtained from the study were analyzed by SPSS 25.0. Additionally, three
      statistical analysis methods (i.e., Mean Absolute Percent Errors (MAPE),
      Bland-Altman plots, and equivalence testing) were utilized to confirm the
      consistency between the measured HRmax and the two prediction equations. The main
      finding was that two equations showed significant differences in predicting the
      HRmax of Korean aged from 7 to 55 years. The outcome of children aged from 7 to
      14 was a different fit in the agreement compared to other age groups. Fox's
      equation had the best fit in the average of the difference closer to zero and
      completely included within the equivalence zone, but females over 15 years old
      revealed higher errors than males in the values calculated by the two equations
      compared to the direct measured HRmax. Consequently, the study demonstrated that 
      both equations tended to overestimate the HRmax for males and females over 15
      years old, and the two universal equations were not suitable to predict the HRmax
      of Koreans except for children aged from 7 to 14 years. The new HRmax prediction 
      equations suggested in this study will more accurately predict the HRmax of
      Asians, and additional analyses should be examined the cross-validity of the
      developed HRmax equation by age and gender in the future study.

TI  - Are House Prices Affected by PM2.5 Pollution? Evidence from Beijing, China.
LID - 8461 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19148461 [doi]
AB  - With the progress of high-quality development in China, residents have begun to
      focus on the air quality of their residential areas in an effort to reduce the
      health threats of air pollution. Gradually, the risk associated with air
      pollution has become an important factor affecting housing prices. To
      quantitatively analyze the impact of air pollution on house prices, panel data,
      including data for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations, house prices
      and other auxiliary variables from 2009 to 2018, were collected from 16 districts
      in Beijing, China. Based on this dataset, ordinary least squares (OLS),
      moderating effect and threshold effect models were constructed for empirical
      investigation. Within the studied decade, PM2.5 pollution shows a significant
      decreasing trend of -3.79 mug m(-3) yr(-1) (p &lt; 0.01). For house prices, the
      opposite trend was found. The empirical results indicate that PM2.5 pollution has
      a negative effect on house prices and that every 1% increase in PM2.5 causes an
      approximately 0.541% decrease in house prices. However, the inhibition of PM2.5
      on housing prices is moderated by regional educational resources, especially in
      areas with high education levels. In addition, per capita disposable income can
      also cause heterogeneities in the impact of PM2.5 on house prices, whereby the
      threshold is approximately CNY 101,185. Notably, the endogeneity problems of this
      study are solved by the instrumental variable method, and the results are robust.
      This outcome suggests that the coordinated control of air pollution and balanced 
      educational resources among regions are required for the future sustainable
      development of the real estate market.

AB  - Ethiopia passed a law prohibiting tobacco smoking in all public places in 2019.
      We conducted a scoping review to identify gaps in the existing literature on
      second-hand smoke (SHS) exposure and smoke-free environments in Ethiopia that
      need to be prioritised for future research to support policy and practice. We
      conducted systematic searches in January 2022 in the following databases:
      Medline, EMBASE, and PsycInfo. Two reviewers independently screened the
      identified study reports for eligibility and extracted data from the eligible
      studies. The extracted data was descriptively analysed, and research
      recommendations were drawn. A stakeholder consultation workshop was held to
      identify research topics on SHS exposure and smoke-free environments in Ethiopia 
      that they perceived to be priorities for primary research. Of the 388 research
      reports identified, only nine were included in the scoping review. The topics
      explored includes prevalence of SHS exposure (six studies); knowledge on SHS
      exposure (three studies); compliance to smoke-free environments legislation (two 
      studies); and exposure to anti-smoking messages (one study). The stakeholders
      prioritised further research addressing compliance monitoring and enforcement of 
      the smoke free laws in Ethiopia. There is a need for studies that test new
      methods for compliance monitoring and enforcement, evaluate strategies to
      increase knowledge on the harms of SHS exposure and the smoke-free legislation,
      and evaluate the current smoke-free legislation in Ethiopia.

TI  - Targeted and Population-Wide Interventions Are Needed to Address the Persistent
      Burden of Anemia among Women of Reproductive Age in Tanzania.
LID - 8401 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19148401 [doi]
AB  - Recent evidence suggests that 44.8% of women of reproductive age (WRA) in
      Tanzania suffer from anemia. Addressing this public health challenge calls for
      local evidence of its burden and determinants thereof for policy and tailored
      interventions. This secondary data analysis used Tanzania Demographic and Health 
      Surveys (TDHS) 2004-2005 and 2015-2016 with a total of 23,203 WRA. Data were
      analyzed using descriptive statistics to characterize the burden of anemia,
      regression analyses to examine the adjusted change in the prevalence of anemia
      and remaining determinants thereof, and the Global Information System (GIS) to
      map the differences in the burden of anemia in Tanzania over the period of one
      decade. Considering the risk factors of anemia observed in our study, WRA in
      Tanzania should have been 15% less likely to suffer from anemia in 2015 compared 
      to 2005. However, a small decline (3.6%) was not evenly distributed across the
      regions in Tanzania. Factors that remained significantly associated with anemia
      among WRA in the latest survey include age above 35 years (AOR = 1.564, p =
      0.007), education level (AOR = 0.720, p = 0.001), pregnancy status (AOR = 1.973, 
      p &lt; 0.001), and use of contraception (AOR of 0.489, p &lt; 0.001). Our
      findings suggest that WRA in Tanzania aged above 35 should be the target
      population to accept the more tailored interventions.

TI  - "Es Muy Tranquilo Aqui": Perceptions of Safety and Calm among Binationally Mobile
      Mexican Immigrants in a Rural Border Community.
LID - 8399 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19148399 [doi]
AB  - Perceptions of community can play an important role in determining health and
      well-being. We know little, however, about residents' perceptions of community
      safety in the Southwestern borderlands, an area frequently portrayed as plagued
      by disorder. The qualitative aim of this community-based participatory research
      study was to explore the perceptions of Mexican-origin border residents about
      their communities in southern Yuma County, Arizona. Our team of University of
      Arizona researchers and staff from Campesinos Sin Fronteras, a grassroots
      farmworker support agency in Yuma County, Arizona, developed a bilingual
      interview guide and recruited participants through radio adds, flyers, and cold
      calls among existing agency clientele. Thirty individual interviews with
      participants of Mexican origin who live in and/or work in rural Yuma County were 
      conducted remotely in 2021. Participants overwhelmingly perceived their
      communities as both calm and safe. While some participants mentioned safety
      concerns, the vast majority described high levels of personal security and
      credited both neighbors and police for ensuring local safety. These perceptions
      were stated in direct contrast to those across the border, where participants had
      positive familial and cultural ties but negative perceptions regarding widespread
      violence. In conclusion, we argue that to understand environmental factors
      affecting health and well-being in Mexican immigrant populations, it is critical 
      to examine the role of binational external referents that color community
      perceptions.

      Simulations, and Mitigation Strategies.
LID - 8396 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19148396 [doi]
AB  - Air pollution is a major health hazard. The traditional habits and unique ethnic 
      fire culture in Hunan Tujia region result in the long-term exposure of residents,
      especially elderly people, to pollutants. In this study, we conducted field
      monitoring and assessment of indoor pollutants in the residential houses of Hunan
      Tujia families and subsequently visualised and simulated fire pollutants in
      representative residential houses by using fire-dynamic-simulator software.
      Pollutant-control strategies, using passive smoke collectors and resizing
      windows, were proposed and simulated for validation. The results revealed that
      passive smoke collectors reduced the pollutant concentration in the hall house by
      43.96%. Furthermore, the optimal window size was 1500 mm x 1500 mm, and the most 
      reasonable windowsill height of the firepit was 1800 mm. The results of the study
      can be used to improve the indoor air quality of Tujia dwellings and mitigate the
      adverse health effects of exposure to indoor air pollution without restricting
      ethnic beliefs and traditional customs.

TI  - Wind Dynamic Characteristics and Wind Tunnel Simulation of Subgrade Sand Hazard
      in the Shannan Wide Valley of the Sichuan-Tibet Railway.
LID - 8341 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19148341 [doi]
AB  - The Shannan wide valley section of the Sichuan-Tibet Railway is located in the
      middle reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River, where sand hazard is severe. A wind
      tunnel simulation experiment was conducted by establishing a subgrade model and
      performing field observation to carry out research on the dynamic environment of 
      blown sand and the sand hazard formation mechanism of subgrade in the Shannan
      wide valley. Observation results showed that the sand-moving wind of the Shannan 
      wide valley was chiefly derived from the ENE direction, and the resultant sand
      transport direction was WSW. Wind speed, the frequency of sand-moving wind, the
      sand drift potential, and the maximum possible sand transport quantity were
      relatively high in the spring. Meanwhile, the dynamic of the wind-blown sand flow
      was further enhanced in the spring, particularly influenced by the flow action of
      the Yarlung Zangbo River. Thus, sand hazard mainly occurred in the spring. The
      Sichuan-Tibet Railway subgrade evidently changed the wind speed, the wind-blown
      sand flow field, and conditions of transport and accumulation. Within the
      distance of 5 times the model height in the windward direction and at the
      subgrade top center to 20 times the model height of the leeward direction was the
      wind speed deceleration zone, resulting in sand particle sediments. A wind speed 
      acceleration zone appeared on the subgrade windward slope shoulder, resulting in 
      wind-blown sand flow erosion. This study provides a scientific basis for sand
      hazard prevention and control in the Sichuan-Tibet Railway.

TI  - Improved Aerobic Capacity and Adipokine Profile Together with Weight Loss Improve
      Glycemic Control without Changes in Skeletal Muscle GLUT-4 Gene Expression in
      Middle-Aged Subjects with Impaired Glucose Tolerance.
LID - 8327 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19148327 [doi]
AB  - (1) Objective: The aim of this study was to clarify the role of adipokines in the
      regulation of glucose metabolism in middle-aged obese subjects with impaired
      glucose tolerance in response to a long-term exercise and dietary intervention.
      (2) Methods: Skeletal muscle, plasma and serum samples were examined in 22
      subjects from an exercise-diet intervention study aiming to prevent type 2
      diabetes. The subjects were further divided into two subgroups (non-responders n 
      = 9 and responders n = 13) based on their achievement in losing at least 3 kg.
      (3) Results: The two-year exercise-diet intervention reduced leptin levels and
      increased adiponectin levels in responders; the changes in leptin levels were
      significantly associated with changes in their weights (r = 0.662, p &lt; 0.01). 
      In responders, insulin sensitivity (Bennett and McAuley index) increased and was 
      associated with changes in maximal oxygen uptake (VO2peak) (r = 0.831, p &lt;
      0.010 and r = 0.890, p &lt; 0.01). In addition, the VO2peak and oxidative
      capacity of skeletal muscle improved in responders, but not in non-responders.
      However, there were no changes between the two groups in expressions of the
      glucose transporter protein-4 (GLUT-4) gene or of AMP-activated protein kinase
      (AMPK)-alpha1 or AMPK-alpha2 proteins. (4) Conclusions: The exercise-diet
      intervention decreased serum leptin and increased serum adiponectin
      concentrations, improved glucose control without affecting GLUT-4 gene expression
      in the skeletal muscle in responders.

TI  - Evaluation of Occupational Health and Safety Management of Listed Companies in
      China's Energy Industry Based on the Combined Weight-Cloud Model: From the
      Perspective of FPE Information Disclosure.
LID - 8313 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19148313 [doi]
AB  - Protecting labor safety and health and actively carrying out occupational safety 
      and health management (OSHM) is a common need worldwide, and it is also one of
      the important efforts of Chinese enterprises under the background of promoting
      the implementation of the Healthy China strategy. Based on in-depth thinking on
      the current stage of OHSM, this study incorporated "management framework,
      management process, management effectiveness" (FPE) into an integrated framework 
      and constructed an FPE evaluation system for enterprise OHSM. This study
      innovatively collected and refined FPE information from the perspective of
      information disclosure and used the combined weight cloud model to evaluate the
      occupational health and safety management level (OHSML) of 69 listed companies in
      China's energy industry from 2009-2019. The results showed the following. (1) The
      OHSML of most listed companies in China's energy industry was still at a low-end 
      level. Among the companies that have issued relevant information reports, only
      5.58% (S = 30) of the sample companies' OHSML were at an acceptable level (Level 
      IV) or declarable level (Level V). The OHSML comprehensive evaluation level of
      92.56% (S = 498) of the sample companies was between the transitional level
      (Level III) and the improved level (Level II). (2) During 2009-2019, although the
      annual OHSML of listed companies in China's energy industry showed an upward
      trend, the growth rate was low, and even the OHSML of some listed companies in
      the energy industry showed the characteristics of reduced fluctuations. (3) From 
      the perspective of the PFT three-dimensional subsystem level of OHSM, the
      evaluation level of the governance framework subsystem was the highest, whereas
      the evaluation level of the management process subsystem and the management
      effectiveness subsystem were relatively low. Finally, according to the relevant
      results, some suggestions were proposed to improve the OHSML of listed companies 
      in China's energy industry. These findings can provide guidance for companies to 
      improve their OSHM performance.

TI  - Trends and Changes in Socio-Economic Inequality in Self-Rated Health among
      Migrants and Non-Migrants: Repeated Cross-Sectional Analysis of National Survey
      Data in Germany, 1995-2017.
LID - 8304 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19148304 [doi]
AB  - Socio-economic inequalities in health may change over time, and monitoring such
      change is relevant to inform adequate policy responses. We aimed to quantify
      socio-economic inequalities in health among people with direct, indirect and
      without migration background in Germany and to assess temporal trends and changes
      between 1995 and 2017. Using nationally representative survey data from the
      Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), we quantified absolute and relative socio-economic
      inequalities in self-reported general health by calculating the slope (SII) and
      relative index of inequality (RII) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) among each 
      group and year (1995-2017) in a repeated cross-sectional design. Temporal trends 
      were assessed using a GLM regression over the SII and RII, respectively. The
      total sample size comprised 492,489 observations, including 108,842 (22.23%)
      among people with migration background. About 31% of the population with and 15% 
      of the population without migration background had a low socio-economic status.
      Socio-economic inequalities in health persisted in the group with migration
      background (1995 to 2017), while inequalities in the non-migrant population
      increased (SII: betaTrend = 0.04, p &lt; 0.01) and were on a higher level. The
      highest socio-economic inequalities in health were found among those with direct 
      migration background (betaSII,&amp;nbsp;min = -0.23, p&lt; 0.01;
      betaSII,&amp;nbsp;max = -0.33, p &lt; 0.01). The results show that the magnitude 
      and temporal dynamics of inequalities differ among populations with direct,
      indirect and without migration background. Monitoring systems can capture and
      investigate these inequalities if migrant populations are adequately integrated
      into the respective systems.

      Perspective and the Moderating Role of Parenthood.
LID - 8283 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19148283 [doi]
AB  - This study introduces a socio-ecological perspective of differences in
      psychological distress between the Palestinian minority and Jewish majority
      citizens of Israel during lockdown due to COVID-19. The study examines the
      association between COVID-19-related stress and psychological distress, and the
      moderating effect of parenthood. Online questionnaires, completed by 1934
      participants (1391 Jews, 552 Palestinians; 1306 parents, 637 without children;
      54.86% female, 45.13% male; M age = 40.38, SD = 13.77) assessed COVID-19-related 
      stressors and depression, anxiety, and stress. The Palestinian minority showed a 
      higher level of COVID-19-related stress and psychological distress than the
      Jewish majority. Parenthood showed a moderating effect on the association between
      COVID-19-related stress and distress for the Jewish majority but not the
      Palestinian minority. The results emphasize the significance of considering
      social status when seeking to understand the differences between minorities and
      majorities in terms of distress and resilience during pandemic events, and the
      need for cultural sensitivity and awareness when issuing instructions in such
      circumstances. Additionally, the results highlight the potential role of
      parenthood as a resilience factor, depending upon social status.

TI  - Estimation and Potential Analysis of Land Population Carrying Capacity in
      Shanghai Metropolis.
LID - 8240 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19148240 [doi]
AB  - It is of great practical significance to understand the current situation of
      urban land carrying capacity, explore its potential space, and continuously
      improve the economic adaptability and resilience and population carrying capacity
      of megacities. Based on the guiding principle of territorial spatial division and
      the concept of moderate-scale resilient cities, combined with GIS technology,
      this study aims to divide land spaces into three types and construct different
      index systems to evaluate the land carrying capacity of Shanghai in different
      spaces. Furthermore, we propose different schemes of estimating subspace land
      population carrying capacity, and the carrying potential of land population is
      analysed as well. The acquired results demonstrate three key points. Firstly, the
      total land population capacity of Shanghai is estimated at 25,476.61-32,047.27
      people, with urban land space being the most dominant for the city's population
      carrying capacity. Furthermore, the inner suburbs carry the largest population,
      and the urban centre carries a larger population density than other areas.
      Secondly, there are significant spatial differences in land population carrying
      potential. Compared with the demographic data from 2017, Shanghai still has a
      population carrying potential of 1293.30-7863.97 people and a suitable population
      carrying potential of 4578.64 people. The population of the urban centre is near 
      the upper limit of the estimated population carrying capacity, and the suburbs,
      especially the outer suburbs, have large population carrying potential. Thirdly, 
      the estimation method adopted in this study can effectively reveal the spatial
      differences in population carrying capacity and the potential of different land
      spaces and different regions in Shanghai, with the estimation results being
      highly credible. The results will provide references for the improvement of the
      multi-scenario population planning strategy in Shanghai, as well as enrich the
      research span and methods currently employed in land carrying capacity.

TI  - Insights into the Deep Phylogeny and Novel Divergence Time Estimation of
      Patellogastropoda from Complete Mitogenomes.
LID - 1273 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/genes13071273 [doi]
AB  - To further understand the origin and evolution of Patellogastropoda, we
      determined the mitochondrial genome sequence of Cellana toreuma, and compared its
      mitogenome characteristics with the other four limpets of Nacellidae. The ratio
      of Ka and Ks indicated that these Nacellidae species were suffering a purifying
      selection, with exception of the atp6 gene. The gene sequence is basically
      consistent among families, while there are great differences among Lottidae
      species. According to the mitogenome sequences of selected gastropod species, we 
      reconstructed a new phylogenetic tree with two methods. The data complement the
      mitogenome database of limpets and is a favorable research tool for the
      phylogenetic analysis of Gastropoda. It is found that there is a long-branch
      attraction (LBA) artefact in the family Lottiidae of Patellogastropoda.
      Therefore, the Patellogastropoda was separated by Heterobranchia, and Lottiidae
      is located at the root of the whole phylogenetic tree. Furthermore, we
      constructed the divergence time tree according to the Bayesian method and
      discussed the internal historical dynamics, and divergence differences among the 
      main lineages of 12 Patellogastropoda under an uncorrelated relaxed molecular
      clock. In turn, we made a more comprehensive discussion on the divergence time of
      limpets at the molecular level.

TI  - Identification of Male-Specific Molecular Markers by Recombination of RhoGEF10
      Gene in Spotted Knifejaw (Oplegnathus punctatus).
LID - 1262 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/genes13071262 [doi]
AB  - The spotted knifejaw (Oplegnathus punctatus) is a marine economic fish with high 
      ecological value, food value, and fishing value, and its growth has obvious sex
      dimorphism. The rapid identification of its sex is beneficial to the development 
      of sex determination and breeding. In this study, the method of comparative
      genomics and PCR amplification was used to further establish a rapid detection
      method for the recombinant RhoGEF10 gene in O. punctatus, which can quickly,
      accurately, and efficiently identify the sex of the O. punctatus to be tested.
      The homologous comparison results of male and female individuals showed that the 
      DNA fragment length of the RhoGEF10 gene on the X1 chromosome was 326 bp, and the
      DNA fragment length on the Y chromosome was 879 bp. Therefore, it can be
      concluded that there is an insert fragment of 553 bp on the Y chromosome. PCR
      amplification results showed that the two DNA fragments of 879 bp and 326 bp were
      amplified in the Y chromosome and X1 chromosome of the male O. punctatus (X1X2Y),
      respectively, and the 879 bp fragment was a unique marker fragment of the
      recombinant RhoGEF10 gene; The female O. punctatus (X1X1X2X2) only a single DNA
      fragment of 326 bp was amplified. At the same time, the inserted fragment of the 
      male individual resulted in partial inactivation of the RhoGEF10 protein, which
      in turn resulted in a slowing of peripheral nerve conduction velocity and
      thinning of the myelin sheath in male O. punctatus. The method shortens the time 
      for accurate identification of the O. punctatus&amp;nbsp;RhoGEF10 gene
      recombination and improves the detection efficiency. It is of great significance 
      and application value in the research of nerve conduction and myelin development,
      male and female sex identification, the preparation of high male seedlings, and
      family selection based on the RhoGEF10 gene in the O. punctatus.

TI  - Heritability Analyses Uncover Shared Genetic Effects of Lung Function and Change 
      over Time.
LID - 1261 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/genes13071261 [doi]
AB  - Genetic influence on lung functions has been identified in previous studies;
      however, the relative longitudinal effects of genetic factors and their
      interactions with smoking on lung function remain unclear. Here, we identified
      the longitudinal effects of genetic variants on lung function by determining
      single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) heritability and genetic correlations, and
      by analyzing interactions with smoking. Subject-specific means and annual change 
      rates were calculated for eight spirometric measures obtained from 6622 Korean
      adults aged 40-69 years every two years for 14 years, and their heritabilities
      were estimated separately. Statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05) heritability
      for the subject-specific means of all spirometric measures (8~32%) and change
      rates of forced expiratory volume in 1 s to forced vital capacity ratio
      (FEV1/FVC; 16%) and post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC (17%) were detected. Significant
      genetic correlations of the change rate with the subject-specific mean were
      observed for FEV1/FVC (rhog = 0.64) and post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC (rhog =
      0.47). Furthermore, post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC showed significant heritability 
      of SNP-by-smoking interaction (hGXS2 = 0.4) for the annual change rate. The GWAS 
      also detected genome-wide significant SNPs for FEV1 (rs4793538), FEV1/FVC
      (rs2704589, rs62201158, and rs9391733), and post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC
      (rs2445936). We found statistically significant evidence of heritability role on 
      the change in lung function, and this was shared with the effects on
      cross-sectional measurements. We also found some evidence of interaction with
      smoking for the change of lung function.

AB  - Transcriptomic profiling of several drugs in cancer cell lines has been utilised 
      to obtain drug-specific signatures and guided combination therapy to combat drug 
      resistance and toxicity. Global metabolomics reflects changes due to altered
      activity of enzymes, environmental factors, etc. Integrating transcriptomics and 
      metabolomics can provide genotype-phenotype correlation, providing meaningful
      insights into alterations in gene expression and its outcome to understand
      differential metabolism and guide therapy. This study uses a multi-omics approach
      to understand the global gene expression and metabolite changes induced by
      Disarib, a novel Bcl2-specific inhibitor in the Ehrlich adenocarcinoma (EAC)
      breast cancer mouse model. RNAseq analysis was performed on EAC mouse tumours
      treated with Disarib and compared to the controls. The expression of 6 oncogenes 
      and 101 tumour suppressor genes interacting with Bcl2 and Bak were modulated upon
      Disarib treatment. Cancer hallmark pathways like DNA repair, Cell cycle,
      angiogenesis, and mitochondrial metabolism were downregulated, and programmed
      cell death platelet-related pathways were upregulated. Global metabolomic
      profiling using LC-MS revealed that Oncometabolites like carnitine, oleic acid,
      glycine, and arginine were elevated in tumour mice compared to normal and were
      downregulated upon Disarib treatment. Integrated transcriptomic and metabolomic
      profiles identified arginine metabolism, histidine, and purine metabolism to be
      altered upon Disarib treatment. Pro-angiogenic metabolites, arginine, palmitic
      acid, oleic acid, and myristoleic acid were downregulated in Disarib-treated
      mice. We further validated the effect of Disarib on angiogenesis by qRT-PCR
      analysis of genes in the VEGF pathway. Disarib treatment led to the
      downregulation of pro-angiogenic markers. Furthermore, the chorioallantoic
      membrane assay displayed a reduction in the formation of the number of secondary 
      blood vessels upon Disarib treatment. Disarib reduces tumours by reducing
      oncometabolite and activating apoptosis and downregulating angiogenesis.

TI  - Genetic Demography of the Blue and Red Shrimp, Aristeus antennatus: A
      Female-Based Case Study Integrating Multilocus Genotyping and Morphometric Data.
LID - 1186 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/genes13071186 [doi]
AB  - In this study, we quantified the three key biological processes, growth,
      recruitment, and dispersal pattern, which are necessary for a better
      understanding of the population dynamics of the blue and red shrimp Aristeus
      antennatus. This marine exploited crustacean shows sex-related distribution along
      the water column, being females predominate in the middle slope. The present
      study attempts to fill the existing gap in the females' genetic demography, as
      scarce knowledge is available despite being the most abundant sex in catches. We 
      analyzed morphometric data and genotyped 12 microsatellite loci in 665
      A.&amp;nbsp;antennatus females collected in two consecutive seasons, winter and
      summer 2016, at the main Mediterranean fishing ground as a model. Almost every
      female in summer was inseminated. Five modal groups were observed in both
      seasons, from 0+ to 4+ in winter and from 1+ to 5+ in summer. Commercial-sized
      sorting based on fishermen's experience resulted in a moderate-to-high assertive 
      method concerning cohort determination. Genetic data pointed out females'
      horizontal movement between neighboring fishing grounds, explaining the low
      genetic divergence detected among western Mediterranean grounds. Our results
      could represent critical information for the future implementation of management 
      measures to ensure long-time conservation of the A.&amp;nbsp;antennatus
      populations.

TI  - Complete Chloroplast Genome of an Endangered Species Quercus litseoides, and Its 
      Comparative, Evolutionary, and Phylogenetic Study with Other Quercus Section
      Cyclobalanopsis Species.
LID - 1184 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/genes13071184 [doi]
AB  - Quercus litseoides, an endangered montane cloud forest species, is endemic to
      southern China. To understand the genomic features, phylogenetic relationships,
      and molecular evolution of Q. litseoides, the complete chloroplast (cp) genome
      was analyzed and compared in Quercus section Cyclobalanopsis. The cp genome of Q.
      litseoides was 160,782 bp in length, with an overall guanine and cytosine (GC)
      content of 36.9%. It contained 131 genes, including 86 protein-coding genes,
      eight ribosomal RNA genes, and 37 transfer RNA genes. A total of 165 simple
      sequence repeats (SSRs) and 48 long sequence repeats with A/T bias were
      identified in the Q. litseoides cp genome, which were mainly distributed in the
      large single copy region (LSC) and intergenic spacer regions. The Q. litseoides
      cp genome was similar in size, gene composition, and linearity of the structural 
      region to those of Quercus species. The non-coding regions were more divergent
      than the coding regions, and the LSC region and small single copy region (SSC)
      were more divergent than the inverted repeat regions (IRs). Among the 13
      divergent regions, 11 were in the LSC region, and only two were in the SSC
      region. Moreover, the coding sequence (CDS) of the six protein-coding genes
      (rps12, matK, atpF, rpoC2, rpoC1, and ndhK) were subjected to positive selection 
      pressure when pairwise comparison of 16 species of Quercus section
      Cyclobalanopsis. A close relationship between Q. litseoides and Quercus edithiae 
      was found in the phylogenetic analysis of cp genomes. Our study provided highly
      effective molecular markers for subsequent phylogenetic analysis, species
      identification, and biogeographic analysis of Quercus.

TI  - The Effects of Catabolism Relationships of Leucine and Isoleucine with BAT2 Gene 
      of Saccharomyces cerevisiae on High Alcohols and Esters.
LID - 1178 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/genes13071178 [doi]
AB  - This study sought to provide a theoretical basis for effectively controlling the 
      content of higher alcohols and esters in fermented foods. In this work,
      isoleucine (Ile) or leucine (Leu) at high levels was used as the sole nitrogen
      source for a BAT2 mutant and its parental Saccharomyces. cerevisiae 38 to
      investigate the effects of the addition of amounts of Ile or Leu and BAT2 on the 
      aroma components in the flavor profile using gas chromatography mass spectrometer
      (GC-MS). The results showed that 2-methyl-butyraldehyde, 2-methyl-1-butanol, and 
      2-methylbutyl-acetate were the products positively correlated with the Ile
      addition amount. In addition, 3-methyl-butyraldehyde, 3-methyl-1-butanol, and
      3-methylbutyl-acetate were the products positively correlated with Leu addition
      amount. BAT2 deletion resulted in a significant decline in the yields of
      2-methyl-butyraldehyde, 3-methyl-butyraldehyde,2-methyl-1-butanol, and
      3-methyl-1-butanol, but also an increase in the yields of 2-methylbutyl-acetate
      and 3-methylbutyl-acetate. We speculated that BAT2 regulated the front and end of
      this metabolite chain in a feedback manner. Improved metabolic chain analyses,
      including the simulated energy metabolism of Ile or Leu, indicated that reducing 
      the added amount of branched-chain amino acids, BAT mutation, and eliminating the
      role of energy cofactors such as NADH/NAD+ were three important ways to control
      the content of high alcohols and esters in fermented foods.

TI  - Effect of Developmental Stages on Genes Involved in Middle and Downstream Pathway
      of Volatile Terpene Biosynthesis in Rose Petals.
LID - 1177 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/genes13071177 [doi]
AB  - Terpenoids are economically and ecologically important compounds, and they are
      vital constituents in rose flower fragrance and rose essential oil. The terpene
      synthase genes (TPSs), trans-prenyltransferases genes (TPTs), NUDX1 are involved 
      in middle and downstream pathway of volatile terpene biosynthesis in rose
      flowers. We identified 7 complete RcTPTs, 49 complete RcTPSs, and 9 RcNUDX1 genes
      in the genome of Rosachinensis. During the flower opening process of butterfly
      rose (Rosachinensis 'Mutabilis', MU), nine RcTPSs expressed in the petals of
      opening MU flowers exhibited two main expression trends, namely high and low, in 
      old and fresh petals. Five short-chain petal-expressed RcTPTs showed expression
      patterns corresponding to RcTPSs. Analysis of differential volatile terpenes and 
      differential expressed genes indicated that higher emission of geraniol from old 
      MU petals might be related to the RcGPPS expression. Comprehensive analysis of
      volatile emission, sequence structure, micro-synteny and gene expression
      suggested that RcTPS18 may encode (E,E)-alpha-farnesene synthase. These findings 
      may be useful for elucidating the molecular mechanism of terpenoid metabolism in 
      rose and are vital for future studies on terpene regulation.

TI  - Research on Potential Network Markers and Signaling Pathways in Type 2 Diabetes
      Based on Conditional Cell-Specific Network.
LID - 1155 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/genes13071155 [doi]
AB  - Traditional methods concerning type 2 diabetes (T2D) are limited to grouped cells
      instead of each single cell, and thus the heterogeneity of single cells is
      erased. Therefore, it is still challenging to study T2D based on a single-cell
      and network perspective. In this study, we construct a conditional cell-specific 
      network (CCSN) for each single cell for the GSE86469 dataset which is a
      single-cell transcriptional set from nondiabetic (ND) and T2D human islet
      samples, and obtain a conditional network degree matrix (CNDM). Since beta cells 
      are the key cells leading to T2D, we search for hub genes in CCSN of beta cells
      and find that ATP6AP2 is essential for regulation and storage of insulin, and the
      renin-angiotensin system involving ATP6AP2 is related to most pathological
      processes leading to diabetic nephropathy. The communication between beta cells
      and other endocrine cells is performed and three gene pairs with obvious
      interaction are found. In addition, different expression genes (DEGs) are found
      based on CNDM and the gene expression matrix (GEM), respectively. Finally, 'dark'
      genes are identified, and enrichment analysis shows that NFATC2 is involved in
      the VEGF signaling pathway and indirectly affects the production of Prostacyclin 
      (PGI2), which may be a potential biomarker for diabetic nephropathy.

TI  - Overexpression of an Inositol Phosphorylceramide Glucuronosyltransferase Gene
      IbIPUT1 Inhibits Na(+) Uptake in Sweet Potato Roots.
LID - 1140 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/genes13071140 [doi]
AB  - IPUT1 is a glycosyltransferase capable of synthesizing the glycosyl inositol
      phosphorylceramide (GIPC) sphingolipid. The GIPC sphingolipid is a Na(+) receptor
      on cell membranes which can sense extracellular Na(+) concentrations, promote the
      increase in intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations, and plays critical roles in
      maintaining intracellular Na(+) balance. Therefore, the IPUT1 gene plays an
      important role in the genetic improvement of crop salt tolerance. Herein, the
      IbIPUT1 gene, which encodes an ortholog of Arabidopsis AtIPUT1, from sweet potato
      was cloned. Agrobacterium rhizogenes-mediated in vivo transgenic technology,
      non-invasive micro-measuring technology (NMT) and Na(+) fluorescence imaging
      technology were then combined to quickly study the potential function of IbIPUT1 
      in salt tolerance. The data showed that IbIPUT1 was involved in the regulation of
      root cell Na(+) balance, and the overexpression of IbIPUT1 could not promote
      sweet potato root cell Na(+) efflux under salt stress, but it could significantly
      inhibit the Na(+) absorption of root cells, thereby reducing the accumulation of 
      Na(+) in root cells under salt stress. Additionally, Ca(2+) efflux in transgenic 
      root cells was slightly higher than that in control roots under salt stress.
      Collectively, an efficient transgenic method for gene function studies was
      established, and our results suggested that IbIPUT1 acts as a candidate gene for 
      the genetic enhancement of sweet potato salt tolerance.

TI  - QTL Mapping for Age-Related Eye Pigmentation in the Pink-Eyed Dilution Castaneus 
      Mutant Mouse.
LID - 1138 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/genes13071138 [doi]
AB  - Pink-eyed dilution castaneus (Oca2(p-cas)) is a mutant gene on mouse chromosome 7
      that arose spontaneously in wild Mus&amp;nbsp;musculus&amp;nbsp;castaneus.
      Homozygotes for Oca2(p-cas) exhibit pink eyes and a light gray coat throughout
      life. In an ordinary mutant strain carrying Oca2(p-cas), we previously discovered
      a novel spontaneous mutation that gradually increases melanin pigmentation in the
      eyes and coat with aging, and we developed a novel mutant strain that was fixed
      for the novel phenotype. The purpose of this study was to map major quantitative 
      trait loci (QTLs) for the novel pigmentation phenotype and for expression levels 
      of four important melanogenesis genes, microphthalmia-associated transcription
      factor (Mitf), tyrosinase (Tyr), tyrosinase-related protein-1 (Tyrp1) and
      dopachrome tautomerase (Dct). We developed 69 DNA markers and created 303 F2 mice
      from two reciprocal crosses between novel and ordinary mutant strains. The QTL
      analysis using a selective genotyping strategy revealed a significant QTL for eye
      pigmentation between 34 and 64 Mb on chromosome 13. This QTL explained
      approximately 20% of the phenotypic variance. The QTL allele derived from the
      novel strain increased pigmentation. Although eye pigmentation was positively
      correlated with Dct expression, no expression QTLs were found, suggesting that
      the pigmentation QTL on chromosome 13 may not be directly in the pathway of any
      of the four melanogenesis genes. This study is the first step toward identifying 
      a causal gene for the novel spontaneous phenotype in mice and is expected to
      discover a new regulatory mechanism for complex melanin biosynthesis during
      aging.

TI  - A Novel 90-kbp Deletion of RUNX2 Associated with Cleidocranial Dysplasia.
LID - 1128 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/genes13071128 [doi]
AB  - Cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD) is a rare autosomal dominant skeletal dysplasia
      caused by runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) mutations. In addition to
      the regular missense, small or large fragment deletions are the common mutation
      types of RUNX2. This study aimed to find the rules of deletions in RUNX2. The
      clinical information of one Chinese CCD family was collected. Genomic DNA was
      extracted for whole-exome sequencing (WES). Bioinformatics analyzed the
      pathogenicity of the variants. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Sanger
      sequencing were carried out using specific primers. RT-PCR and Q-PCR were also
      used to detect the mRNA level of RUNX2. The CCD studies related with deletions in
      RUNX2 from 1999 to 2021 from HGMD and PubMed were collected and analyzed for the 
      relationship between the phenotypes and the length of deleted fragments. The
      proband presented typical CCD features, including delayed closure of cranial
      sutures, clavicle dysplasia, abnormal teeth. WES, PCR with specific primers and
      Sanger sequencing revealed a novel heterozygous 90-kbp deletion in RUNX2
      (NG_008020.2 g.103671~193943), which caused a substitution (p.Asn183Ile) and
      premature termination (p.Asp184*). In addition, the mRNA expression of RUNX2 was 
      decreased by 75.5% in the proband. Herein, 31 types of deletions varying from 2
      bp to 800 kbp or covering the whole gene of RUNX2 were compared and the
      significant phenotypic difference was not found among these deletions. The CCD
      phenotypes were related with the final effects of RUNX2 mutation instead of the
      length of deletion. WES has the defects in identifying large indels, and direct
      PCR with specific primers and Sanger sequencing could make up for the
      shortcoming.

LID - 10.3390/genes13071116 [doi]
AB  - Taeniopterygidae is a medium-sized family of stoneflies. The phylogeny of
      Taeniopterygidae was widely accepted based on the morphological analyses.
      However, there are different opinions based on molecular data. To date, only two 
      taeniopterygid mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) were available, and more
      sampling is needed to obtain precise phylogenetic relationships. In this
      research, the Strophopteryx fasciata mitogenome was sequenced and analyzed. The
      complete mitogenome of S. fasciata was 15,527 bp in length and contained 37 genes
      and a non-coding control region. Among taeniopterygid mitogenomes, the length
      variation was minimal in protein-coding genes (PCGs), transfer RNA genes (tRNAs) 
      and ribosomal RNA genes (rRNAs), but very different in the control region.
      Similar to mitogenomes of other taeniopterygid species, the S. fasciata
      mitogenome was consistently AT biased and displayed positive AT- and negative
      GC-skews of the whole mitogenome. Most PCGs used ATN as the start codon and
      TAA/TAG as the stop codon. The stop codons were far less variable than the start 
      codons in taeniopterygid mitogenomes. All Ka/Ks ratios were less than 1,
      indicating the presence of purifying selection in these genes. The secondary
      structures of transfer and ribosomal RNA genes of S. fasciata mitogenome are
      highly conserved with other taeniopterygid species. In the control region of the 
      S. fasciata mitogenome, some essential elements (tandem repeats, stem-loop
      structures, and poly-N stretch, etc.) were observed. Two phylogenetic trees were 
      inferred from Bayesian inference (BI) and Maximum Likelihood (ML) methods
      generated the identical topology across the PCGR dataset. The relationships of
      five families in Nemouroidea were recovered as Leuctridae + ((Capniidae +
      Taeniopterygidae) + (Nemouridae + Notonemouridae)). These results will help us
      understand the mitogenome structure of taeniopterygid species and the
      evolutionary relationship within Plecoptera.

TI  - Medical Malpractice Lawsuits Involving Trainees in Obstetrics and Gynecology in
      the USA.
LID - 1328 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/healthcare10071328 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: While the liability risks for obstetrics and gynecology (ob/gyn)
      physicians are widely recognized, little is known about how trainees have been
      involved in ob/gyn lawsuits. OBJECTIVES: To characterize involvement of trainees 
      in malpractice lawsuits related to ob/gyn. METHODS: The legal database Westlaw
      was utilized to collect ob/gyn-related malpractice lawsuits involving trainees
      reported from 1986 to 2020 in the USA. OUTCOME: Forty-six malpractice cases
      involving ob/gyn trainees were identified, including 34 cases related to
      obstetrics and 12 to gynecology. There were 11 cases alleging lack of informed
      consent, including 7 cases alleging lack of consent for trainee involvement. Of
      the 34 obstetrics cases, 27 related to procedural complications, 17 to treatment,
      13 to diagnosis, and 4 to informed consent. Of these, 17 were decided in favor of
      the physician, 6 resulted in findings of negligence, 9 had unknown outcomes, and 
      3 ended in settlement. For the 6 cases ending in a finding of negligence, the
      mean award was $2,174,472 compared to $685,000 for those that were settled. Of
      the 12 gynecology cases, 8 related to procedural complications, 7 to informed
      consent, 3 to diagnosis, and 2 to treatment. Of these, 6 were decided in favor of
      the physician, 3 resulted in findings of negligence, and 3 had unknown outcomes. 
      For the cases ending in a finding of negligence, the mean award was $465,000.
      CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK: This review of malpractice cases highlights types of
      situations in which trainees are sued and reveals the importance of designing
      curriculum around faculty training and supervision regarding trainee involvement 
      in patient care.

TI  - Adaptability, Interdisciplinarity, Engageability: Critical Reflections on Green
      Social Work Teaching and Training.
LID - 1245 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/healthcare10071245 [doi]
AB  - The upward tendencies of global climate change, disasters, and other diverse
      crises have been urgently calling for green social work (GSW) interventions which
      engage a holistic approach to explore diverse societal dimensions' compounded
      influences on inhabitants' individual and collective health and well-being in
      disaster settings. Though globally gaining more attention, GSW has been slow to
      develop in the Canadian social work curriculum and professional training. This
      deficit jeopardizes integrating environmental and climate justice and
      sustainability in social work research and practice in Canada. In response to
      this pedagogical inadequacy, this article employs a critical reflection approach 
      to examine two authors' two-academic-year teaching-learning and
      supervision-training experiences of GSW-specific in-class and field education in 
      a Master of Social Work program. The content analysis illustrates three essential
      components for GSW-specific teaching and training, namely adaptability,
      interdisciplinarity, and engageability. These components enhance the prospective 
      social workers' micro-, mezzo-, and macro-level practices to better support
      individuals, families, and communities affected by extreme events and promote
      their health and well-being in disaster and non-disaster scenarios. These
      GSW-specific pedagogies shed light on the fact that integrading climate change,
      disasters, and diverse crises in pedagogical innovations should be encouraged
      beyond the social work profession. A multidisciplinary multi-stakeholder
      engagement approach would comprehensively investigate and evaluate the essential 
      components and evidence-based strategies that better serve inhabitants and
      promote resilience and sustainability.

TI  - Upper-Limb Robot-Assisted Therapy Based on Visual Error Augmentation in Virtual
      Reality for Motor Recovery and Kinematics after Chronic Hemiparetic Stroke: A
      Feasibility Study.
LID - 1186 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/healthcare10071186 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of upper-limb
      robot-assisted therapy based on visual error augmentation in virtual reality
      (UL-RAT-VEAVR) for motor recovery and kinematics after chronic hemiparetic
      stroke. This study applied a single-group pre- and post-intervention study
      design. A total of 27 stroke survivors (20 males and 7 females; mean age 54.51
      years, mean onset duration 12.7 months) volunteered to participate in this study.
      UL-RAT-VEAVR was performed three times a week for four weeks, amounting to a
      total of twelve sessions, in which an end-effector-based robotic arm was used
      with a visual display environment in virtual reality. Each subject performed a
      total of 480 point-to-point movements toward 3 direction targets (medial,
      ipsilateral, and contralateral side) in the visual display environment system
      while holding the handle of the end-effector-based robotic arm. The visual error 
      (distance to the targets on the monitor) in virtual reality was increased by 5%
      every week based on the subject's maximum point-to-point reaching trajectory.
      Upper-limb motor recovery was measured in all subjects using the Fugl-Meyer
      Assessment (FMA) upper-limb subscale, the Box and Block Test (BBT), and the
      Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), before and after training. In addition, a
      kinematic assessment was also performed before and after training and consisted
      of time, speed, distance, and curvilinear ratio for point-to-point movement.
      There were significant improvements in both upper-limb motor function and
      kinematics after 4 weeks of UL-RAT-VEAVR (p &lt; 0.05). Our results showed that
      the UL-RAT-VEAVR may have the potential to be used as one of the upper-limb
      rehabilitation strategies in chronic stroke survivors. Future studies should
      investigate the clinical effects of the error-augmentation paradigm using an RCT 
      design.

TI  - Association of the rs17574 DPP4 Polymorphism with Premature Coronary Artery
      Disease in Diabetic Patients: Results from the Cohort of the GEA Mexican Study.
LID - 1716 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics12071716 [doi]
AB  - Previously, it has been reported that hypoalphalipoproteinemia (HA) is associated
      with rs17574 DDP4 polymorphism. Considering that in diabetic patients, HA is
      often present and is a risk factor for premature coronary artery disease (pCAD), 
      the study aimed to evaluate the association of this polymorphism with pCAD in
      diabetic individuals. We genotyped the rs17574 polymorphism in 405 pCAD patients 
      with T2DM, 736 without T2DM, and 852 normoglycemic individuals without pCAD and
      T2DM as controls. Serum DPP4 concentration was available in 818 controls, 669
      pCAD without T2DM, and 339 pCAD with T2DM. The rs17574 polymorphism was
      associated with lower risk of pCAD (padditive = 0.007; pdominant = 0.003,
      pheterozygote = 0.003, pcodominant1 = 0.003). In pCAD with T2DM patients, DPP4
      levels were lower when compared with controls (p &lt; 0.001). In the whole
      sample, individuals with the rs17574 GG genotype have the lowest protein levels
      compared with AG and AA (p = 0.039) carriers. However, when the same analysis was
      repeated separately in all groups, a significant difference was observed in the
      pCAD with T2DM patients; carriers of the GG genotype had the lowest protein
      levels compared with AG and AA (p = 0.037) genotypes. Our results suggest that in
      diabetic patients, the rs17574G&amp;nbsp;DPP4 allele could be considered as a
      protective genetic marker for pCAD. DPP4 concentrations were lower in the
      diabetic pCAD patients, and the rs17574GG carriers had the lowest protein levels.

LID - 10.3390/diagnostics12071655 [doi]
AB  - Liver cancer is the sixth most detected tumor and the third leading cause of
      tumor death worldwide. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary 
      liver malignancy with specific risk factors and a targeted population. Imaging
      plays a major role in the management of HCC from screening to post-therapy
      follow-up.&amp;nbsp;In order to optimize the diagnostic-therapeutic management
      and using a universal report, which allows more effective communication among the
      multidisciplinary team, several classification systems have been proposed over
      time, and LI-RADS is the most utilized.&amp;nbsp;Currently, LI-RADS comprises
      four algorithms addressing screening and surveillance, diagnosis on computed
      tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diagnosis on contrast-enhanced 
      ultrasound (CEUS) and treatment response on CT/MRI. The algorithm allows guiding 
      the radiologist through a stepwise process of assigning a category to a liver
      observation, recognizing both major and ancillary features. This process allows
      for characterizing liver lesions and assessing treatment. In this review, we
      highlighted both major and ancillary features that could define HCC. The
      distinctive dynamic vascular pattern of arterial hyperenhancement followed by
      washout in the portal-venous phase is the key hallmark of HCC, with a specificity
      value close to 100%. However, the sensitivity value of these combined criteria is
      inadequate. Recent evidence has proven that liver-specific contrast could be an
      important tool not only in increasing sensitivity but also in diagnosis as a
      major criterion. Although LI-RADS emerges as an essential instrument to support
      the management of liver tumors, still many improvements are needed to overcome
      the current limitations. In particular, features that may clearly distinguish HCC
      from cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) and combined HCC-CCA lesions and the assessment
      after locoregional radiation-based therapy are still fields of research.

TI  - Diabetic Retinopathy Detection from Fundus Images of the Eye Using Hybrid Deep
      Learning Features.
LID - 1607 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics12071607 [doi]
AB  - Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a medical condition present in patients suffering
      from long-term diabetes. If a diagnosis is not carried out at an early stage, it 
      can lead to vision impairment. High blood sugar in diabetic patients is the main 
      source of DR. This affects the blood vessels within the retina. Manual detection 
      of DR is a difficult task since it can affect the retina, causing structural
      changes such as Microaneurysms (MAs), Exudates (EXs), Hemorrhages (HMs), and
      extra blood vessel growth. In this work, a hybrid technique for the detection and
      classification of Diabetic Retinopathy in fundus images of the eye is proposed.
      Transfer learning (TL) is used on pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) 
      models to extract features that are combined to generate a hybrid feature vector.
      This feature vector is passed on to various classifiers for binary and multiclass
      classification of fundus images. System performance is measured using various
      metrics and results are compared with recent approaches for DR detection. The
      proposed method provides significant performance improvement in DR detection for 
      fundus images. For binary classification, the proposed modified method achieved
      the highest accuracy of 97.8% and 89.29% for multiclass classification.

TI  - Effective Adsorption of Colorants from Sugarcane Juice by Bagasse-Based
      Biochar-Hydroxyapatite Composite.
LID - 2171 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/foods11142171 [doi]
AB  - The clarification of sugarcane juice is a crucial stage in the sugar
      manufacturing process, as it affects evaporator performance, sugar quality and
      yield. The emergence of environmentally friendly and efficient adsorption
      technology has resulted in widespread interest in carbon-based materials.
      However, their low adsorption capacity and reusability make them unsuitable for
      processing sugarcane juice. Here, we provide a cost-effective and sustainable
      method to dope hydroxyapatite (HAP) nanoparticles on porous carbon (BBC) derived 
      from sugarcane bagasse (BBC-HAP). The composite shows excellent adsorption
      capacity for color extract from sugarcane juice of 313.33 mg/g, far more
      effective than the commercially available carbon-based adsorbents. Isotherm
      studies show that the adsorption of BBC-HAP composite to the colorants is a
      monolayer process. The pseudo-first-order (PFO) and pseudo-second-order (PSO)
      kinetic models demonstrate that the adsorption process is dominated by
      chemisorption and supplemented by physical adsorption.

TI  - Whey Protein Hydrolysates Improved the Oxidative Stability and Water-Holding
      Capacity of Pork Patties by Reducing Protein Aggregation during Repeated
      Freeze-Thaw Cycles.
LID - 2133 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/foods11142133 [doi]
AB  - The effects of whey protein hydrolysates (WPH) on myofibrillar protein (MP)
      oxidative stability and the aggregation behavior and the water-holding capacity
      of pork patties during freeze-thaw (F-T) cycles were investigated. During F-T
      cycles, the total sulfhydryl content and zeta potential of MP decreased, while
      peroxide value, surface hydrophobicity, particle size, pressure loss and
      transverse relaxation times increase. The oxidative stability and the
      water-holding capacity of pork patties were enhanced by the addition of WPH in a 
      dose-dependent manner, whereas the MP aggregation decreased. The addition of 15% 
      WPH had the most obvious effects on the pork patties, which was similar to that
      of the 0.02% BHA. After nine F-T cycles, the POV, surface hydrophobicity,
      particle size and pressure loss of the pork patties with 15% WPH were reduced by 
      17.20%, 30.56%, 34.67% and 13.96%, respectively, while total sulfhydryl content
      and absolute value of zeta potential increased by 69.62% and 146.14%,
      respectively. The results showed that adding 15% WPH to pork patties can be an
      effective method to inhibit lipid and protein oxidation, reducing protein
      aggregation and improving the water-holding capacity of pork patties during F-T
      cycles.

TI  - Research Progress on the Extraction, Structure, and Bioactivities of
      Polysaccharides from Coriolus versicolor.
LID - 2126 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/foods11142126 [doi]
AB  - Coriolus is the dried fruiting body of Coriolus versicolor (L. ex Fr.) Quel. C.
      versicolor (CV) is a worldwide-distributed fungus, which is common and widely
      used in primitive forests in the northern hemisphere. Polysaccharide, as the main
      active ingredient in CV, has a variety of biological activities, such as
      promoting immune function, antivirus, antitumor, anti-diabetes, and so on.
      However, Coriolus versicolor polysaccharide (CVP) faces the problems of a single 
      extraction method, lack of research on separation and purification, and the
      research on structural characterization is limited to the primary structure.
      Furthermore, the existing research results have not been systematically reviewed.
      Therefore, this paper summarizes the research status of CVP in terms of
      extraction technology, separation and purification, structural characterization, 
      and pharmacological activity in recent years, in order to provide a theoretical
      basis for in-depth research, development, and utilization of CVP.

TI  - Astaxanthin Extract from Shrimp (Trachypenaeus curvirostris) By-Products Improves
      Quality of Ready-to-Cook Shrimp Surimi Products during Frozen Storage at -18
      degrees C.
LID - 2122 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/foods11142122 [doi]
AB  - The effects of astaxanthin extract (AE) from shrimp by-products on the quality
      and sensory properties of ready-to-cook shrimp surimi products (RC-SSP) during
      frozen storage at -18 degrees C were investigated. Changes in 2-thiobarbituric
      acid reactive substances (TBARS) value, sulfhydryl groups, carbonyls,
      salt-soluble protein content, textural properties, color, and sensory quality
      over specific storage days were evaluated. The AE from shrimp by-products
      contained 4.49 mug/g tocopherol and 23.23 mug/g astaxanthin. The shrimp surimi
      products supplemented with 30 g/kg AE had higher redness values and greater
      overall acceptability and texture properties after cooking (p &lt; 0.05). AE
      showed higher oxidative stability in RC-SSP than the control, as evidenced by
      lower TBARS and carbonyl content, and higher sulfhydryl and salt-soluble protein 
      content. AE from shrimp by-products had positive effects on the antioxidant
      activity and color difference of RC-SSP, and could be used as a potential
      multifunctional additive for the development of shrimp surimi products.

TI  - Smartphone-Based Image Analysis for Rapid Evaluation of Kiwifruit Quality during 
      Cold Storage.
LID - 2113 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/foods11142113 [doi]
AB  - As a vitamin C-rich fruit, choosing the eating time for kiwifruit with the best
      quality during the shelf period is still a problem for consumers. This paper
      mainly focuses on the correlation between cold storage time, quality indexes,
      volatile flavor compounds of postharvest kiwifruit and RGB value readouts from
      photos taken by mobile phone. Results indicated that the R to B ratio values
      (Central R/B) and B to G ratio values (Central B/G) of the central site of
      kiwifruit were strongly associated with storage time and all quality indicators. 
      The central R/B was negatively correlated with titratable acidity, vitamin C and 
      2,6-Nonadienal contents and firmness and positively correlated with storage time,
      weight loss, soluble solids content, total soluble sugars, total plate counts and
      1,3-Cyclooctadiene. We provide a novel and smart strategy to predict the shelf
      life and quality parameters of kiwifruit by capturing and calculating RGB values 
      using a smartphone.

TI  - Dietary Schizochytrium Microalgae Affect the Fatty Acid Profile of Goat Milk:
      Quantification of Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA) and Its Distribution at Sn-2
      Position.
LID - 2087 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/foods11142087 [doi]
AB  - The objective of this study was to detect the influence of dietary Schizochytrium
      microalgae on milk composition, milk fatty acids, and milk sn-2 fatty acids in
      goat's milk. Firstly, we could see that the fat content increased in low
      microalgae supplementation goat's milk (LM, 15 g/day) and the lactose content
      decreased in medium microalgae supplementation goat's milk (MM, 25 g/day)
      compared with control goat's milk (C, 0 g/day). Moreover, the absolute
      concentration of the docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) of LM, MM, and high microalgae
      supplementation (HM, 35 g/day) goat's milk was 29.485, 32.351, and 24.817 mg/100 
      g raw milk, respectively, which were all higher than that in the control goat's
      milk with 4.668 mg/100 g raw milk. In addition, the sn-2 DHA content increased in
      MM and HM goat's milk. However, the decreasing trend of the sn-2 DHA content was 
      observed in LM goat's milk. As for other fatty acids, the oleic acid (C18:1n9c)
      and linolenic acid (C18:3n3) content decreased and increased, respectively, in
      all experimental goat milk. Finally, an interesting phenomenon was found, which
      was that docosanoic acid (C22:0) and tetracosenic acid (C24:1) were only detected
      in test goat's milk. Consequently, the phenomena of this study demonstrated that 
      dietary Schizochytrium microalgae have an obvious effect on the fatty acid and
      sn-2 fatty acid profile of goat's milk, and they provide an effective method to
      improve the content of goat's milk DHA in practical production.

AB  - The physicochemical, structural properties, antioxidant, and angiotensin
      I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activities of fish skin protein hydrolysate 
      (SPH) that were freeze-dried (SPH-FD) and spray-dried (SPH-SD) were investigated.
      SPH-SD showed abundant volatile compounds, higher DPPH radical scavenging
      activity and ferrous iron chelating activity than SPH-FD, while the ABTS radical 
      scavenging activity and ACE inhibitory activity were not influenced by the drying
      method. Amino acid compositions showed a higher proportion of proline and
      hydroxyproline residues in SPH-FD. The major molecular weights were both
      distributed below 1000 Da. SPH-SD had spherical structures, while SPH-FD had
      glass shard-like structures. The results indicated that the drying method could
      affect the physicochemical properties of hydrolysates, and SPH-SD showed
      potential prospects in developing functional fortified foods.

LID - 10.3390/foods11142082 [doi]
AB  - Bacillus natto is a kind of probiotic with various functional characteristics,
      which can produce a lot of nutrients during growth and reproduction. Bacillus
      natto was used as strain, the number of viable bacteria and the content of
      soluble dietary fiber in millet bran were used as indexes to study the effects of
      inoculum size, fermentation time, and fermentation temperature on the
      fermentation effect, and the optimal fermentation conditions were determined by a
      response surface experiment. The antidiarrhea effect of fermented millet bran
      prepared under the best technological conditions was evaluated. The results
      showed that the optimum fermentation conditions were as follows: inoculum size
      was 7.48%, fermentation time was 47.04 h, and fermentation temperature was 36.06 
      degrees C. Under the optimal fermentation conditions, the viable bacteria count
      of millet bran was 8.03 log CFU/mL and the soluble dietary fiber content was
      12.14%. The fermented millet bran can significantly reduce the intestinal thrust 
      rate and serum levels of IL-6, IL-12, and TNF-alpha, and significantly increase
      the secretion of SIgA in the intestinal mucosa, which can relieve diarrhea
      induced by senna leaf in mice. The results of this study can provide the
      scientific basis for deep processing of millet bran and efficient utilization of 
      fermented millet bran, and also provide the theoretical basis for clinical
      treatment of diarrhea.

TI  - Development of Simplified Models for Non-Destructive Hyperspectral Imaging
      Monitoring of S-ovalbumin Content in Eggs during Storage.
LID - 2024 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/foods11142024 [doi]
AB  - S-ovalbumin content is an indicator of egg freshness and has an important impact 
      on the quality of processed foods. The objective of this study is to develop
      simplified models for monitoring the S-ovalbumin content of eggs during storage
      using hyperspectral imaging (HSI) and multivariate analysis. The hyperspectral
      images of egg samples at different storage periods were collected in the
      wavelength range of 401-1002 nm, and the reference S-ovalbumin content was
      determined by spectrophotometry. The standard normal variate (SNV) was employed
      to preprocess the raw spectral data. To simplify the calibration models,
      competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS) was applied to select feature
      wavelengths from the whole spectral range. Based on the full and feature
      wavelengths, partial least squares regression (PLSR) and least squares support
      vector machine (LSSVM) models were developed, in which the simplified LSSVM model
      yielded the best performance with a coefficient of determination for prediction
      (R(2)P) of 0.918 and a root mean square error for prediction (RMSEP) of 7.215%.
      By transferring the quantitative model to the pixels of hyperspectral images, the
      visualizing distribution maps were generated, providing an intuitive and
      comprehensive evaluation for the S-ovalbumin content of eggs, which helps to
      understand the conversion of ovalbumin into S-ovalbumin during storage. The
      results provided the possibility of implementing a multispectral imaging
      technique for online monitoring the S-ovalbumin content of eggs.

TI  - An Improved Tiered Head Pose Estimation Network with Self-Adjust Loss Function.
LID - 974 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/e24070974 [doi]
AB  - As an important task in computer vision, head pose estimation has been widely
      applied in both academia and industry. However, there remains two challenges in
      the field of head pose estimation: (1) even given the same task (e.g., tiredness 
      detection), the existing algorithms usually consider the estimation of the three 
      angles (i.e., roll, yaw, and pitch) as separate facets, which disregard their
      interplay as well as differences and thus share the same parameters for all
      layers; and (2) the discontinuity in angle estimation definitely reduces the
      accuracy. To solve these two problems, a THESL-Net (tiered head pose estimation
      with self-adjust loss network) model is proposed in this study. Specifically,
      first, an idea of stepped estimation using distinct network layers is proposed,
      gaining a greater freedom during angle estimation. Furthermore, the reasons for
      the discontinuity in angle estimation are revealed, including not only labeling
      the dataset with quaternions or Euler angles, but also the loss function that
      simply adds the classification and regression losses. Subsequently, a
      self-adjustment constraint on the loss function is applied, making the angle
      estimation more consistent. Finally, to examine the influence of different angle 
      ranges on the proposed model, experiments are conducted on three popular public
      benchmark datasets, BIWI, AFLW2000, and UPNA, demonstrating that the proposed
      model outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.

TI  - Effect of Superheat Steam on Ejector in Distilled Water Preparation System for
      Medical Injection.
LID - 960 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/e24070960 [doi]
AB  - In this study, a wet steam model was used to investigate the effect of steam
      superheat on ejector performance and non-equilibrium condensation phenomena. The 
      simulation data for the ejector were validated with experimental data. The
      simulations show that an increase in primary flow superheat will increase the
      entrainment ratio, while an increase in secondary flow superheat will decrease
      the entrainment ratio. The output fluid superheat has little effect on the
      entrainment ratio. As the primary flow superheat increases from 0 to 20 K, the
      starting position of non-equilibrium condensation moves backward by 5 mm, and the
      mass fraction of condensed droplets decreases by 20%. The higher the secondary
      flow superheat, the lower the mass fraction of liquid in the diffusion chamber.
      The superheat level of the output fluid has no influence on the non-equilibrium
      condensation phenomenon of the ejector.

TI  - Multi-Objective Optimization of the Basic and Regenerative ORC Integrated with
      Working Fluid Selection.
LID - 902 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/e24070902 [doi]
AB  - A multi-objective optimization based on the non-dominated sorting genetic
      algorithm (NSGA-II) is carried out in the present work for the basic organic
      Rankine cycle (BORC) and regenerative ORC (RORC) systems. The selection of
      working fluids is integrated into multi-objective optimization by parameterizing 
      the pure working fluids into a two-dimensional array. Two sets of decision
      indicators, exergy efficiency vs. thermal efficiency and exergy efficiency vs.
      levelized energy cost (LEC), are adopted and examined. Five decision variables
      including the turbine inlet temperature, vapor superheat degree, the evaporator
      and condenser pinch temperature differences, and the mass fraction of the mixture
      are optimized. It is found that the turbine inlet temperature is the most
      effective factor for both the BORC and RORC systems. Compared to the reverse
      variation of exergy efficiency and thermal efficiency, only a weak conflict
      exists between the exergy efficiency and LEC which tends to make the binary
      objective optimization be a single objective optimization. The RORC provides
      higher thermal efficiency than BORC at the same exergy efficiency while the LEC
      of RORC also becomes higher because the bare module cost of buying one more heat 
      exchange is higher than the cost reduction due to the reduced heat transfer area.
      Under the heat source temperature of 423.15 K, the final obtained exergy and
      thermal efficiencies are 45.6% and 16.6% for BORC, and 38.6% and 20.7% for RORC, 
      respectively.

TI  - Intelligent Fault Diagnosis of Industrial Robot Based on Multiclass
      Mahalanobis-Taguchi System for Imbalanced Data.
LID - 871 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/e24070871 [doi]
AB  - One of the biggest challenges for the fault diagnosis research of industrial
      robots is that the normal data is far more than the fault data; that is, the data
      is imbalanced. The traditional diagnosis approaches of industrial robots are more
      biased toward the majority categories, which makes the diagnosis accuracy of the 
      minority categories decrease. To solve the imbalanced problem, the traditional
      algorithm is improved by using cost-sensitive learning, single-class learning and
      other approaches. However, these algorithms also have a series of problems. For
      instance, it is difficult to estimate the true misclassification cost,
      overfitting, and long computation time. Therefore, a fault diagnosis approach for
      industrial robots, based on the Multiclass Mahalanobis-Taguchi system (MMTS), is 
      proposed in this article. It can be classified the categories by measuring the
      deviation degree from the sample to the reference space, which is more suitable
      for classifying imbalanced data. The accuracy, G-mean and F-measure are used to
      verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach on an industrial robot
      platform. The experimental results show that the proposed approach's accuracy,
      F-measure and G-mean improves by an average of 20.74%, 12.85% and 21.68%,
      compared with the other five traditional approaches when the imbalance ratio is
      9. With the increase in the imbalance ratio, the proposed approach has better
      stability than the traditional algorithms.

AB  - The mismatch between the circulating influenza B virus (IBV) and the vaccine
      strain contributes to the rapid emergence of IBV infection cases throughout the
      globe, which necessitates the development of effective vaccines conferring broad 
      protection. Here, we generated influenza B virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines
      expressing hemagglutinin, neuraminidase, or both antigens derived from the
      influenza B virus (B/Washington/02/2019 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virus,
      B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata lineage)-like virus. We found that irrespective of
      the derived antigen lineage, immunizing mice with the IBV VLPs significantly
      reduced lung viral loads, minimized bodyweight loss, and ensured 100% survival
      upon Victoria lineage virus B/Colorado/06/2017 challenge infection. These results
      were closely correlated with the vaccine-induced antibody responses and HI titer 
      in sera, IgG, IgA antibody responses, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses, germinal
      center B cell responses, and inflammatory cytokine responses in the lungs. We
      conclude that hemagglutinin, neuraminidase, or both antigen-expressing VLPs
      derived from these influenza B viruses that were circulating during the 2020/21
      season provide cross-protections against mismatched Victoria lineage virus
      (B/Colorado/06/2017) challenge infections.

TI  - The Potential Role of Myokines/Hepatokines in the Progression of Neuronal Damage 
      in Streptozotocin and High-Fat Diet-Induced Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Mice.
LID - 1521 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines10071521 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetes is highly prevalent, and the number of patients with
      diabetic sarcopenia and cognitive impairment has grown, leading to decreased
      quality of life. Although the exact mechanisms between sarcopenia and cognitive
      impairment have not been elucidated, it is speculated that muscle and
      liver-derived mediators might contribute to brain function. This study examined
      the molecular mechanisms associated with muscle-brain interaction accompanied by 
      insulin resistance (IR) caused by aberrant energy metabolism via
      myokines/hepatokines in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) mice. METHODS: T2DM was
      induced by a high-fat diet and streptozotocin injection. Behavior tests were
      conducted to analyze grip strength and cognitive function. Histopathological
      changes in skeletal muscle and brain tissue were examined by hematoxylin and
      eosin staining and the protein levels of biomarkers related to energy metabolism 
      via myokines/hepatokines were measured by western blot. RESULTS: T2DM caused
      peripheral and central IR. Furthermore, T2DM led to aberrant energy metabolism
      through the reduced fibroblast growth factor 21 dependent AMP-activated kinase
      (AMPK)/surtuin1/proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha pathway 
      in T2DM. Subsequently, reduced circulating myokines/hepatokines were in
      accordance with their levels with hippocampal neuronal markers in T2DM mice.
      Accordingly, skeletal muscle (muscle strength: 2.83 +/- 0.39 vs. 2.187 +/- 0.51, 
      p = 0.004) and brain function (PAT: 38.5 +/- 57.91 vs. 11.556 +/- 12.03, p =
      0.02) impairment and morphological changes (muscle cross-sectional area: 872.43
      +/- 242.87 vs. 743.68 +/- 169.31, p = 0.01; density of neurons in hippocampus:
      145 +/- 15.13 vs. 77 +/- 35.51, p = 0.05; density of neurons in cortex: 138.333
      +/- 6.66 vs. 78 +/- 17.35, p = 0.05) were shown in T2DM mice. In addition, the
      working ability demonstrated by Y-maze was positively correlated with % lean mass
      (p = 0.046, R = 0.3426). CONCLUSIONS: T2DM led to aberrant energy in skeletal
      muscle and brain via myokines/hepatokines. This study suggested that myokines and
      hepatokines might have potential roles in skeletal muscle and central metabolic
      functions which can mediate cognitive function in T2DM mice.

TI  - The Role of Mitochondrial Metabolism, AMPK-SIRT Mediated Pathway, LncRNA and
      MicroRNA in Osteoarthritis.
LID - 1477 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines10071477 [doi]
AB  - Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common joint disease characterized by
      degeneration of articular cartilage and causes severe joint pain, physical
      disability, and impaired quality of life. Recently, it was found that
      mitochondria not only act as a powerhouse of cells that provide energy for
      cellular metabolism, but are also involved in crucial pathways responsible for
      maintaining chondrocyte physiology. Therefore, a growing amount of evidence
      emphasizes that impairment of mitochondrial function is associated with OA
      pathogenesis; however, the exact mechanism is not well known. Moreover, the
      AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-Sirtuin (SIRT) signaling pathway, long
      non-coding RNA (lncRNA), and microRNA (miRNA) are important for regulating the
      physiological and pathological processes of chondrocytes, indicating that these
      may be targets for OA treatment. In this review, we first focus on the importance
      of mitochondria metabolic dysregulation related to OA. Then, we show recent
      evidence on the AMPK-SIRT mediated pathway associated with OA pathogenesis and
      potential treatment options. Finally, we discuss current research into the
      effects of lncRNA and miRNA on OA progression or inhibition.

AB  - Chemical barriers are composed of those sites of the human body where potential
      pathogens can contact the host cells. A chemical barrier is made up by different 
      proteins that are part of the antimicrobial and immunomodulatory protein/peptide 
      (AMP) family. Proteins of the AMP family exert antibacterial, antiviral, and/or
      antifungal activity and can modulate the immune system. Besides these proteins, a
      wide range of proteases and protease inhibitors can also be found in the chemical
      barriers maintaining a proteolytic balance in the host and/or the pathogens. In
      this review, we aimed to identify the chemical barrier components in nine human
      body fluids. The interaction networks of the chemical barrier proteins in each
      examined body fluid were generated as well.

TI  - Techniques of Frameless Robot-Assisted Deep Brain Stimulation and Accuracy
      Compared with the Frame-Based Technique.

LID - 10.3390/brainsci12070906 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Frameless robot-assisted deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an
      innovative technique for leads implantation. This study aimed to evaluate the
      accuracy and precision of this technique using the Sinovation SR1 robot. METHODS:
      35 patients with Parkinson's disease who accepted conventional frame-based DBS
      surgery (n = 18) and frameless robot-assisted DBS surgery (n = 17) by the same
      group of neurosurgeons were analyzed. The coordinate of the tip of the intended
      trajectory was recorded as xi, yi, and zi. The actual position of lead
      implantation was recorded as xa, ya, and za. The vector error was calculated by
      the formula of radical(xi - xa)(2) + (yi - ya)(2) + (zi - za)(2) to evaluate the 
      accuracy. RESULTS: The vector error was 1.52 +/- 0.53 mm (range: 0.20-2.39 mm) in
      the robot-assisted group and was 1.77 +/- 0.67 mm (0.59-2.98 mm) in the
      frame-based group with no significant difference between two groups (p = 0.1301).
      In 10.7% (n = 3) frameless robot-assisted implanted leads, the vector error was
      greater than 2.00 mm with a maximum offset of 2.39 mm, and in 35.5% (n = 11)
      frame-based implanted leads, the vector error was larger than 2.00 mm with a
      maximum offset of 2.98 mm. Leads were more posterior than planned trajectories in
      the robot-assisted group and more medial and posterior in the conventional
      frame-based group. CONCLUSIONS: Awake frameless robot-assisted DBS surgery was
      comparable to the conventional frame-based technique in the accuracy and
      precision for leads implantation.

TI  - Brain Metabolic Connectivity Patterns in Patients with Prolonged Disorder of
      Consciousness after Hypoxic-Ischemic Injury: A Preliminary Study.
LID - 892 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/brainsci12070892 [doi]
AB  - Understanding the patterns of brain glucose metabolism and connectivity in
      hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) patients with prolonged disorders of
      consciousness (DOC) may be of positive significance to the accurate assessment of
      consciousness and the optimization of neuromodulation strategy. We
      retrospectively analyzed the brain glucose metabolism pattern and its correlation
      with clinical Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) score in six HIE patients with 
      prolonged DOC who had undergone (18)F-deoxyglucose brain positron emission
      tomography scanning (FDG-PET). We also compared the differences in global
      metabolic connectivity patterns and the characteristics of several brain networks
      between HIE patients and healthy controls (HC). The metabolism of multiple brain 
      regions decreased significantly in HIE patients, and the degree of local
      metabolic preservation was correlated with CRS-R score. The internal metabolic
      connectivity of occipital lobe and limbic system in HIE patients decreased, and
      their metabolic connectivity with frontal lobe, parietal lobe and temporal lobe
      also decreased. The metabolic connectivity patterns of default mode network,
      dorsal attention network, salience network, executive control network and
      subcortex network of HIE also changed compared with HC. The present study
      suggested that pattern of cerebral glucose metabolism and network connectivity of
      HIE patients with prolonged DOC were significantly different from those of
      healthy people.

TI  - Energy Metabolic Disorder of Astrocytes May Be an Inducer of Migraine Attack.
LID - 844 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/brainsci12070844 [doi]
AB  - Migraine is a chronic headache disease, which ranks second in years lost due to
      disability. However, the mechanism of migraines is still not clear. In migraine
      patients, fasting can trigger headache attacks. We explored the probable
      mechanism of why fasting can induce headaches. Nitroglycerin (NTG) was used to
      induce acute migraine attacks in mice. Primary astrocytes were used to study the 
      pathophysiological mechanism and a Seahorse analyzer was used to detect
      mitochondrial function. NTG induced more serious headaches in the fasting group. 
      Both the head-scratching times and climbing-cage times in the fasting group were 
      higher than those in normal-diet group. More ROS and inflammatory factors, such
      as IL-6 and IL-1beta, were induced in low-glucose conditions. Seahorse showed
      that the basal oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and OCR for ATP production were
      lower in mice who had received NTG with low glucose levels than in other groups. 
      The activity of AMPK was inhibited in this group, which may explain the Seahorse 
      results. We concluded that in the low-glucose state, astrocytes produce more
      inflammatory factors, ROS, which may be a result of mitochondrial metabolism
      dysfunction. Improving mitochondrial function and supplying enough substrates may
      be an option for relieving migraine attacks.

TI  - Corticospinal Excitability and Inhibition Are Not Different between Concussed
      Males and Females.
LID - 824 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/brainsci12070824 [doi]
AB  - It has been consistently demonstrated that females report greater numbers of
      concussions in sex-comparable sports and take longer to recover from concussive
      symptoms than males. However, it is unknown if the neurophysiological
      consequences of concussion may contribute to these sex differences in concussion 
      symptoms and recovery. The purpose of this study was to examine potential
      sex-related differences in neurophysiology in healthy and concussed individuals. 
      Twenty-one (nine F) concussed individuals (20.9 +/- 4.1 years; CONC) and
      twenty-one age-, sex-, height-, weight-, and activity-matched controls (21.2 +/- 
      4.2 years; CONT) participated in the study. The CONC group reported to the lab
      within 72 h, 1-week, and 2-weeks post-injury and the CONT group followed a
      similar measurement schedule. Using transcranial magnetic stimulation, motor
      evoked potential (MEP) amplitude and cortical silent period (CSP) duration were
      measured from the first dorsal interosseous muscle to assess corticospinal
      excitability and inhibition, respectively. There were no significant differences 
      across time (p >/= 0.13) or between the CONC and CONT group in MEP amplitude (p =
      0.72) or CSP duration (p = 0.54). Overall, males (119.08 +/- 29.91 ms) had
      significantly longer CSP durations compared with females (101.24 +/- 33.43 ms),
      indicating greater corticospinal inhibition in males, regardless of injury status
      (p = 0.04). An important and novel finding of this study was the lack of
      differences in these neurophysiological measures between males and females
      following concussion. To our knowledge, this is the first study to document
      greater corticospinal inhibition in males compared with females.

TI  - Overexpression of NNMT in Glioma Aggravates Tumor Cell Progression: An Emerging
      Therapeutic Target.
LID - 3538 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/cancers14143538 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Increasing evidence has revealed that nicotinamide N-methyltransferase
      (NNMT) is a key factor influencing the prognosis of tumors. The present study
      aimed to investigate the role of NNMT in glioma and to elucidate the associated
      functional mechanisms. METHODS: Clinical samples were analyzed by
      immunohistochemical staining and Western blotting to evaluate NNMT expression in 
      glioma and normal brain tissues. The correlation between NNMT expression and
      glioma was analyzed using the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Additionally, 
      NNMT was knocked down in two types of glioma cells, U87 and U251, to evaluate the
      invasive ability of these cells. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
      (qRT-PCR) was used to validate NNMT knockdown in the cells. Furthermore, ELISA
      was used to determine the balance between nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and
      nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrogen (NAD/NADH ratio), which verified the
      altered methylation patterns in the cells. The glioma xenograft mouse models were
      used to verify the regulatory role of NNMT, GAP43, and SIRT1. RESULTS: Analysis
      based on our clinical glioma samples and TCGA database revealed that
      overexpression of NNMT was associated with poor prognosis of patients. Knockdown 
      of NNMT reduced the invasive ability of glioma cells, and downregulation of its
      downstream protein GAP43 occurred due to altered cellular methylation caused by
      NNMT overexpression. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis confirmed that NNMT modulated
      the NAD-related signaling pathway and showed a negative association between NNMT 
      and SIRT1. Moreover, the regulatory roles of NNMT, GAP43, and SIRT1 were
      confirmed in glioma xenograft mouse models. CONCLUSION: Overexpression of NNMT
      causes abnormal DNA methylation through regulation of the NAD/NADH ratio, which
      in turn leads to the downregulation of GAP43 and SIRT1, eventually altering the
      biological behavior of tumor cells.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To improve the selection of patients for ureteroscopy, avoid
      excessive testing and reduce costs, we aimed to develop and validate a diagnostic
      urine assay for upper tract urinary carcinoma (UTUC). METHODS: In this cohort
      study we recruited 402 patients from six Hunan hospitals who underwent
      ureteroscopy for hematuria, including 95 patients with UTUC and 307 patients with
      non-UTUC findings. Midstream morning urine samples were collected before
      ureteroscopy and surgery. DNA was extracted and qPCR was used to analyze
      mutations in TERT and FGFR3 and the methylation of NRN1. In the training set, the
      random forest algorithm was used to build an optimal panel. Lastly, the Beijing
      cohort (n = 76) was used to validate the panel. RESULTS: The panel combining the 
      methylation with mutation markers led to an AUC of 0.958 (95% CI: 0.933-0.975)
      with a sensitivity of 91.58% and a specificity of 94.79%. The panel presented a
      favorable diagnostic value for UTUC vs. other malignant tumors (AUC = 0.920) and 
      UTUC vs. benign disease (AUC = 0.975). Furthermore, combining the panel with age 
      revealed satisfactory results, with 93.68% sensitivity, 94.44% specificity, AUC =
      0.970 and NPV = 98.6%. In the external validation process, the model showed an
      AUC of 0.971, a sensitivity of 95.83% and a specificity of 92.31, respectively.
      CONCLUSIONS: A novel diagnostic model for analyzing hematuria patients for the
      risk of UTUC was developed, which could lead to a reduction in the need for
      invasive examinations. Combining NRN1 methylation and gene mutation (FGFR3 and
      TERT) with age resulted in a validated accurate prediction model.

TI  - Effect of Condom Use after CIN Treatment on Cervical HPV Biomarkers Positivity:
      Prolonged Follow Up Study.
LID - 3530 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/cancers14143530 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several factors contribute in the cervical healing process following 
      local surgical treatment; in a previous work our group has documented a
      beneficial mid-term role of regular condom use immediately postoperatively in
      terms of CIN relapse prevention and expression of active viral biomarkers.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Aiming to investigate whether the favorable contribution
      of consistent condom use could be extrapolated in the longer term, we conducted a
      prospective single center observational study including women scheduled to
      undergo conservative excisional treatment for CIN (LLETZ procedure). In all women
      a strong recommendation for consistent use for the first 6 months was given. For 
      204 women who underwent the procedure and completed successfully the two-year
      follow up a complete dataset of HPV biomarkers' results obtained six months and
      two years postoperatively was available. Patients were asked to complete a
      questionnaire to assess condom use compliance. A 90% compliance rate represented 
      the threshold for consistent use. An LBC sample was obtained and tested for HPV
      genotyping, E6 & E7 mRNA by NASBA technique as well as flow cytometry, and p16 at
      0 (pre-treatment), 6 and 24 months. HPV DNA and other related biomarkers status
      at 6 and 24 months, treatment failures at 24 months and condom use compliance
      rates represented study outcomes. RESULTS: Six months post-operatively we
      documented a reduction in the rates of HPV DNA positivity, which was detected in 
      only 23.2% of compliant condom users in comparison to 61.9% in the non-compliant 
      group (p &lt; 0.001, OR: 0.19, 95%CI: 0.1-0.36). For the HPV mRNA test, either
      assessed with the NASBA method or with flow cytometry, reduced positivity
      percentages were observed in the compliant group, in particular 1.6% vs. 8% for
      NASBA and 7.1% vs. 16.4% using flow cytometry, although these differences were
      not statistically significant (p = 0.1039 and 0.0791, respectively). Finally,
      reduced p16 positivity rates were documented in the compliant group. At the two
      year follow up, a more pronounced difference in HPV DNA positivity rates was
      observed, specifically only 13% positivity among the compliant women compared
      with 71% of the non-compliant (p &lt; 0.0001); this illustrates a further
      decreasing trend compared with the 6th month in the compliant group as opposed to
      an increasing tendency in the non-compliant group, respectively (difference:
      9.0%, 95% CI: 0% to 20.6%, p = 0.1523). At that time, 80% of the failed
      treatments were HPV mRNA positive compared to 10% positivity for the cases
      treated successfully (OR: 34, 95%CI: 6.8-173, p &lt; 0.0001), a finding
      indicative that HPV mRNA E6 & E7 positivity accurately predicts treatment
      failure; p16 positivity was also observed at higher rates in cases with treatment
      failure. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent condom use following conservative excisional CIN
      treatment appears to significantly reduce rates of CIN recurrence and biomarkers 
      of HPV expression. Additional HPV vaccination at the time of treatment could
      further enhance the positive effect of consistent condom use.

LID - 10.3390/cancers14143486 [doi]
AB  - Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) reside within the tumor microenvironment,
      facilitating cancer progression and metastasis via direct and indirect
      interactions with cancer cells and other stromal cell types. CAFs are composed of
      heterogeneous subpopulations of activated fibroblasts, including myofibroblastic,
      inflammatory, and immunosuppressive CAFs. In this study, we sought to identify
      subpopulations of CAFs isolated from human lung adenocarcinomas and describe
      their transcriptomic and functional characteristics through single-cell RNA
      sequencing (scRNA-seq) and subsequent bioinformatics analyses. Cell trajectory
      analysis of combined total and THY1 + CAFs revealed two branching points with
      five distinct branches. Based on Gene Ontology analysis, we denoted Branch 1 as
      "immunosuppressive", Branch 2 as "neoantigen presenting", Branch 4 as
      "myofibroblastic", and Branch 5 as "proliferative" CAFs. We selected
      representative branch-specific markers and measured their expression levels in
      total and THY1 + CAFs. We also investigated the effects of these markers on CAF
      activity under coculture with lung cancer cells. This study describes novel
      subpopulations of CAFs in lung adenocarcinoma, highlighting their potential value
      as therapeutic targets.

AB  - Immunotherapy brought long-term benefits for partial patients with lung squamous 
      cell carcinoma (LUSC). The predictor of anti-PD-L1 therapy was controversial and 
      limited in LUSC. We aimed to explore novel biomarker for LUSC immunotherapy and
      the potential mechanism. Five hundred and twenty-five Chinese patients (Geneplus 
      cohort) with LUSC underwent targeted sequencing and were involved to explore the 
      genomic profiling. TP53 and LRP1B were the most frequently recurrent genes and
      correlated to higher tumor mutational burden (TMB). We observed that LUSC
      patients with TP53 and LRP1B co-wild (co-wild type) were associated with better
      survival of anti-PD-L1 therapy compared with TP53 mutant or LRP1B mutant (mutant 
      type) in POPAR/OAK cohort. Copy-number variation (CNV) and whole genome doubling 
      (WGD) data from TCGA LUSC cohort were obtained to assess the CNV events. There
      were fewer CNV alterations and lower chromosome instability in patients with
      TP53/LRP1B co-wild compared with those with TP53/LRP1B mutant. RNA expression
      data from the TCGA LUSC cohort were collected to explore the differences in RNA
      expression and tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) between mutant and co-wild
      groups. The TP53/LRP1B co-wild type had a significantly increased proportion of
      multiple tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), including activated CD8 T cell,
      activated dendritic cell (DC), and effector memory CD8 T cell. Immune-related
      gene sets including checkpoint, chemokine, immunostimulatory, MHC and receptors
      were enriched in the co-wild type. In conclusion, TP53/LRP1B co-wild LUSC
      conferred an elevated response rate in anti-PD-L1 therapy and improved survival, 
      which was associated with a chromosome-stable phenotype and an activated immune
      microenvironment.

TI  - Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts in the Hypoxic Tumor Microenvironment.
LID - 3321 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/cancers14143321 [doi]
AB  - Solid cancers are composed of malignant cells and their surrounding matrix
      components. Hypoxia plays a critical role in shaping the tumor microenvironment
      that contributes to cancer progression and treatment failure. Cancer-associated
      fibroblasts (CAFs) are one of the most prominent components of the tumor
      microenvironment. CAFs are highly sensitive to hypoxia and participates in the
      crosstalk with cancer cells. Hypoxic CAFs modulate several mechanisms that induce
      cancer malignancy, such as extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, immune evasion,
      metabolic reprogramming, angiogenesis, metastasis, and drug resistance. Key
      signaling molecules regulating CAFs in hypoxia include transforming growth factor
      (TGF-beta) and hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). In this article, we summarize
      the mechanisms underlying the hypoxic regulation of CAFs and how hypoxic CAFs
      affect cancer development and progression. We also discuss the potential
      therapeutic strategies focused on targeting CAFs in the hypoxic tumor
      microenvironment.

TI  - Ultralow Laser Power Three-Dimensional Superresolution Microscopy Based on
      Digitally Enhanced STED.
LID - 539 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/bios12070539 [doi]
AB  - The resolution of optical microscopes is limited by the optical diffraction
      limit; in particular, the axial resolution is much lower than the lateral
      resolution, which hinders the clear distinction of the three-dimensional (3D)
      structure of cells. Although stimulated emission depletion (STED) superresolution
      microscopy can break through the optical diffraction limit to achieve 3D
      superresolution imaging, traditional 3D STED requires high depletion laser power 
      to acquire high-resolution images, which can cause irreversible light damage to
      biological samples and probes. Therefore, we developed an ultralow laser power 3D
      STED superresolution imaging method. On the basis of this method, we obtained
      lateral and axial resolutions of 71 nm and 144 nm, respectively, in fixed cells
      with 0.65 mW depletion laser power. This method will have broad application
      prospects in 3D superresolution imaging of living cells.

LID - 536 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/bios12070536 [doi]
AB  - A highly sensitive and precise Love wave mode surface acoustic wave (SAW)
      immunosensor based on an ST-cut 90 degrees X quartz substrate and an SiO2
      wave-guiding layer was developed to detect cancer-related biomarkers of
      carcinoembryonic antigens (CEAs). A delay line structure of the SAW device with a
      resonant frequency of 196 MHz was designed/fabricated, and its surface was
      functionalized through CEA antibody immobilization. The CEA antibodies were bound
      with gold nanoparticles and CEA antibodies to form a sandwich structure, which
      significantly amplified the mass loading effect and enhanced the maximum
      responses by 30 times. The center frequency of the Love wave immunosensor showed 
      a linear response as a function of the CEA concentration in the range of 0.2-5
      ng/mL. It showed a limit of detection of 0.2 ng/mL, and its coefficient of
      determination was 0.983. The sensor also showed minimal interference from
      nonspecific adsorptions, thus demonstrating its promise for point-of-care
      applications for cancer biomarkers.

      in volume and cost. In this study, an integrated polarization-splitting grating
      coupler is demonstrated to achieve both efficient coupling and polarization
      splitting at the D1 transition wavelength of rubidium (795 nm). With this device,
      linearly polarized probe light that experienced optical rotation due to
      magnetically induced circular birefringence (of alkali medium) can be coupled and
      split into individual output ports. This is especially advantageous for emerging 
      chip-scale AMs in that differential detection of ultra-weak magnetic field can be
      achieved through compact planar optical components. In addition, the device is
      designed with silicon nitride material on silicon dioxide that is deposited on a 
      silicon substrate, being compatible with the current CMOS nanofabrication
      industry. Our study paves the way for the development of on-chip AMs that are the
      foundation for future multi-channel high-spatial resolution bio-magnetic imaging 
      instruments.

TI  - Interrogation on the Cellular Nano-Interface and Biosafety of Repeated
      Nano-Electroporation by Nanostraw System.
LID - 522 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/bios12070522 [doi]
AB  - Cell perforation is a critical step for intracellular drug delivery and real-time
      biosensing of intracellular signals. In recent years, the nanostraws system has
      been developed to achieve intracellular drug delivery with minimal invasiveness
      to the cells. Repeated cell perforation via nano-system could allow delivery of
      multiple drugs into cells for cell editing, but the biosafety is rarely explored.
      In this work, a nanostraw-mediated nano-electroporation system was developed,
      which allowed repeated perforation of the same set of cells in a minimally
      invasive manner, while the biosafety aspect of this system was investigated.
      Highly controllable fabrication of Al2O3 nanostraw arrays based on a porous
      polyethylene terephthalate (PET) membrane was integrated with a microfluidic
      device to construct the nanostraw-electroporation system. The pulse conditions
      and intervals of nano-electroporation were systematically optimized to achieve
      efficient cells perforation and maintain the viability of the cells. The cells
      proliferation, the early apoptosis activities after nanostraw-electroporation and
      the changes of gene functions and gene pathways of cells after repeated
      nano-electroporation were comprehensively analyzed. These results revealed that
      the repeated nanostraw-electroporation did not induce obvious negative effects on
      the cells. This work demonstrates the feasibility of repeated
      nano-electroporation on cells and provides a promising strategy for future
      biomedical applications.

TI  - Application and Progress of Chemometrics in Voltammetric Biosensing.
LID - 494 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/bios12070494 [doi]
AB  - The voltammetric electrochemical sensing method combined with biosensors and
      multi-sensor systems can quickly, accurately, and reliably analyze the
      concentration of the main analyte and the overall characteristics of complex
      samples. Simultaneously, the high-dimensional voltammogram contains the rich
      electrochemical features of the detected substances. Chemometric methods are
      important tools for mining valuable information from voltammetric data.
      Chemometrics can aid voltammetric biosensor calibration and multi-element
      detection in complex matrix conditions. This review introduces the voltammetric
      analysis techniques commonly used in the research of voltammetric biosensor and
      electronic tongues. Then, the research on optimizing voltammetric biosensor
      results using classical chemometrics is summarized. At the same time, the
      incorporation of machine learning and deep learning has brought new opportunities
      to further improve the detection performance of biosensors in complex samples.
      Finally, smartphones connected with miniaturized voltammetric biosensors and
      chemometric methods provide a high-quality portable analysis platform that shows 
      great potential in point-of-care testing.

TI  - A Dual-Band High-Sensitivity THz Metamaterial Sensor Based on Split Metal
      Stacking Ring.
LID - 471 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/bios12070471 [doi]
AB  - Terahertz (THz)-detection technology has been proven to be an effective and rapid
      non-destructive detection approach in biomedicine, quality control, and safety
      inspection, among other applications. However, the sensitivity of such a
      detection method is limited due to the insufficient power of the terahertz source
      and the low content, or ambiguous characteristics, of the analytes to be
      measured. Metamaterial (MM) is an artificial structure in which periodic
      sub-wavelength units are arranged in a regular manner, resulting in extraordinary
      characteristics beyond those possessed by natural materials. It is an effective
      method to improve the ability of terahertz spectroscopy detection by utilizing
      the metamaterial as a sensor. In this paper, a dual-band, high-sensitivity THz MM
      sensor based on the split metal stacking ring resonator (SMSRR) is proposed. The 
      appliance exhibited two resonances at 0.97 and 2.88 THz in the range of 0.1 to 3 
      THz, realizing multi-point matching between the resonance frequency and the
      characteristic frequency of the analytes, which was able to improve the
      reliability and detection sensitivity of the system. The proposed sensor has good
      sensing performance at both resonant frequencies and can achieve highest
      sensitivities of 304 GHz/RIU and 912 GHz/RIU with an appropriate thickness of the
      analyte. Meanwhile, the advantage of multi-point matching of the proposed sensor 
      has been validated by distinguishing four edible oils based on their different
      refractive indices and demonstrating that the characteristics obtained in
      different resonant frequency bands are consistent. This work serves as a
      foundation for future research on band extension and multi-point feature matching
      in terahertz detection, potentially paving the way for the development of
      high-sensitivity THz MM sensors.

TI  - Ultrasensitive Detection of COVID-19 Virus N Protein Based on p-Toluenesulfonyl
      Modified Fluorescent Microspheres Immunoassay.
LID - 437 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/bios12070437 [doi]
AB  - The pandemic of new coronary pneumonia caused by the COVID-19 virus continues to 
      ravage the world. Large-scale population testing is the key to controlling
      infection and related mortality worldwide. Lateral flow immunochromatographic
      assay (LFIA) is fast, inexpensive, simple to operate, and easy to carry, very
      suitable for detection sites. This study developed a COVID-19 N protein detect
      strip based on p-toluenesulfonyl modified rare earth fluorescent microspheres.
      The p-toluenesulfonyl-activated nanomaterials provide reactive sulfonyl esters to
      covalently attach antibodies or other ligands containing primary amino or
      sulfhydryl groups to the nanomaterial surface. Antibodies are immobilized on
      these nanomaterials through the Fc region, which ensures optimal orientation of
      the antibody, thereby increasing the capture rate of the target analyte. The use 
      of buffers with high ionic strength can promote hydrophobic binding; in addition,
      higher pH could promote the reactivity of the tosyl group. The detection limit of
      the prepared COVID-19 N protein strips can reach 0.01 ng/mL, so it has great
      application potential in large-scale population screening.

TI  - Profiling Antibiotic Resistance in Acinetobacter calcoaceticus.
LID - 978 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/antibiotics11070978 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acinetobacter spp. have emerged as troublesome pathogens due to their
      multi-drug resistance. The majority of the work to date has focused on the
      antibiotic resistance profile of Acinetobacter baumannii. Although
      A.&amp;nbsp;calcoaceticus strains are isolated in the hospital setting, limited
      information is available on these closely related species. METHODS & RESULTS: The
      computational analysis of antibiotic resistance genes in 1441 Acinetobacter
      genomes revealed that A. calcoaceticus harbored a similar repertoire of
      multi-drug efflux pump and beta-lactam resistance genes as A. baumannii, leading 
      us to speculate that A. calcoaceticus would have a similar antibiotic resistance 
      profile to A. baumannii. To profile the resistance patterns of A. calcoaceticus, 
      strains were examined by Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion and phenotypic microarrays.
      We found that Acinetobacter strains were moderately to highly resistant to
      certain antibiotics within fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, and 
      other antibiotic classes. These data indicate that A. calcoaceticus has a similar
      antibiotic resistance profile as A. baumannii ATCC 19606. We also identified that
      all Acinetobacter species were sensitive to 5-fluoroorotic acid, novobiocin, and 
      benzethonium chloride. CONCLUSION: Collectively, these data provide new insights 
      into the antibiotic resistance in A. calcoaceticus and identify several
      antibiotics that could be beneficial in treating Acinetobacter infections.

TI  - Antimicrobial Resistance in the Environment: Towards Elucidating the Roles of
      Bioaerosols in Transmission and Detection of Antibacterial Resistance Genes.
LID - 974 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/antibiotics11070974 [doi]
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is continuing to grow across the world. Though
      often thought of as a mostly public health issue, AMR is also a major
      agricultural and environmental problem. As such, many researchers refer to it as 
      the preeminent One Health issue. Aerial transport of antimicrobial-resistant
      bacteria via bioaerosols is still poorly understood. Recent work has highlighted 
      the presence of antibiotic resistance genes in bioaerosols. Emissions of AMR
      bacteria and genes have been detected from various sources, including wastewater 
      treatment plants, hospitals, and agricultural practices; however, their impacts
      on the broader environment are poorly understood. Contextualizing the roles of
      bioaerosols in the dissemination of AMR necessitates a multidisciplinary
      approach. Environmental factors, industrial and medical practices, as well as
      ecological principles influence the aerial dissemination of resistant bacteria.
      This article introduces an ongoing project assessing the presence and fate of AMR
      in bioaerosols across Canada. Its various sub-studies include the assessment of
      the emissions of antibiotic resistance genes from many agricultural practices,
      their long-distance transport, new integrative methods of assessment, and the
      creation of dissemination models over short and long distances. Results from
      sub-studies are beginning to be published. Consequently, this paper explains the 
      background behind the development of the various sub-studies and highlight their 
      shared aspects.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics and Safety of Doripenem in Healthy Chinese Subjects and Monte
      Carlo Dosing Simulations.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of doripenem
      in healthy Chinese subjects and evaluate the optimal dosage regimens of
      doripenem. A randomized, single-dose, three-period, self-crossover controlled
      extended-infusion clinical trial was conducted with 12 healthy Chinese subjects. 
      Plasma and urine samples were collected to determine doripenem concentrations.
      Non-compartmental and population PK analysis were performed to characterize the
      PK of doripenem. The Monte Carlo simulation was employed to optimize dosing
      regimens based on the probability of target attainment of doripenem against
      pathogens with different minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC). All 12 healthy 
      Chinese subjects completed the study, and the doripenem was well tolerated. The
      study showed linearity relationships in the peak plasma concentration and the
      area under the concentration-time curve after intravenous infusion of doripenem
      from 0.25 g to 1.0 g. The cumulative urinary recovery rate of doripenem was
      68.1-72.0% within 24 h. PPK modeling showed a two-compartmental model, with
      first-order elimination presenting the best fit for doripenem PK. Monte Carlo
      simulation results showed that 1.0 g q12h or 0.5 g q8h was an optimal regimen for
      pathogens susceptible to doripenem (MIC </= 1 mg/L); while high dose and extended
      infusion (1 g, q8h, 4 h infusion) was proposed for unsusceptible pathogens (2 </=
      MIC </= 8 mg/L). In the dose range of 0.25 to 1.0 g, doripenem showed linear
      pharmacokinetics. Doripenem at 1.0 g with a prolonged infusion time of 4 h was
      predicted to be effective against pathogens with MICs as high as 8 mg/L.

TI  - Mining Amphibian and Insect Transcriptomes for Antimicrobial Peptide Sequences
      with rAMPage.
LID - 952 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/antibiotics11070952 [doi]
AB  - Antibiotic resistance is a global health crisis increasing in prevalence every
      day. To combat this crisis, alternative antimicrobial therapeutics are urgently
      needed. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), a family of short defense proteins, are
      produced naturally by all organisms and hold great potential as effective
      alternatives to small molecule antibiotics. Here, we present rAMPage, a scalable 
      bioinformatics discovery platform for identifying AMP sequences from RNA
      sequencing (RNA-seq) datasets. In our study, we demonstrate the utility and
      scalability of rAMPage, running it on 84 publicly available RNA-seq datasets from
      75 amphibian and insect species-species known to have rich AMP repertoires.
      Across these datasets, we identified 1137 putative AMPs, 1024 of which were
      deemed novel by a homology search in cataloged AMPs in public databases. We
      selected 21 peptide sequences from this set for antimicrobial susceptibility
      testing against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus and observed that
      seven of them have high antimicrobial activity. Our study illustrates how in
      silico methods such as rAMPage can enable the fast and efficient discovery of
      novel antimicrobial peptides as an effective first step in the strenuous process 
      of antimicrobial drug development.

TI  - Bactericidal Activity of Sodium Bituminosulfonate against Staphylococcus aureus.
LID - 896 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/antibiotics11070896 [doi]
AB  - Antibiotic resistance is increasing worldwide making it necessary to search for
      alternative antimicrobials. Sodium bituminosulfonate is a long-known substance,
      whose antimicrobial inhibitory activity has recently been re-evaluated. However, 
      to the best of our knowledge, the bactericidal mode of action of this substance
      has not been systematically characterized. The aim of this study was to
      investigate the in vitro bactericidal activity of sodium bituminosulfonate by
      determining the minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBC), as well as the
      rapidity of bactericidal effect by time-kill curves. Clinical isolates of
      methicillin-susceptible (MSSA, n = 20) and methicillin-resistant (mecA/mecC-MRSA,
      n = 20) Staphylococcus aureus were used to determine MBC by a broth microdilution
      method. Sodium bituminosulfonate (Ichthyol((R)) light) was tested in
      double-dilution concentration steps ranging from 0.03 g/L to 256 g/L. For
      time-kill analysis, two reference and two clinical S. aureus strains were tested 
      with different concentrations of sodium bituminosulfonate (1x minimal inhibitory 
      concentration (MIC), 2x MIC, 4x MIC, 16x MIC and 256x MIC). For MSSA isolates,
      MBC50, MBC90 and the MBC range were 0.5 g/L, 1.0 g/L and 0.125-1.0 g/L; (MBC/MIC 
      ratio)50, (MBC/MIC ratio)90 and the range of the MBC/MIC ratio were 4, 4 and 1-8,
      respectively. Among MRSA isolates, MBC50, MBC90 and the MBC range amounted to 0.5
      g/L, 1.0 g/L and 0.06-1.0 g/L; (MBC/MIC ratio)50, (MBC/MIC ratio)90 and the range
      of the MBC/MIC ratio were 2, 4 and 1-8, respectively. Time-kill kinetics revealed
      a bactericidal effect after 30 min for sodium bituminosulfonate concentrations of
      16x MIC and 256x MIC. The bactericidal activity against MSSA and MRSA was
      demonstrated for sodium bituminosulfonate. The killing was very rapid with the
      initial population reduced by 99.9% after only short incubation with
      concentrations of 16x MIC and higher.

TI  - Evaluation of the Abilities of Three Kinds of Copper-Based Nanoparticles to
      Control Kiwifruit Bacterial Canker.
LID - 891 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/antibiotics11070891 [doi]
AB  - Kiwifruit bacterial canker caused by Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae reduces 
      kiwifruit crop yield and quality, leading to economic losses. Unfortunately, few 
      agents for its control are available. We prepared three kinds of copper-based
      nanoparticles and applied them to control kiwifruit bacterial canker. The
      successful synthesis of Cu(OH)2 nanowires, Cu3(PO4)2 nanosheets, and Cu4(OH)6Cl2 
      nanoparticles were confirmed by transmission and scanning electron microscopy,
      energy dispersive spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction analysis, and X-ray
      photoelectron spectroscopy. The minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) of the
      three nanoparticles were 1.56 mug/mL, which exceeded that of the commercial agent
      thiodiazole copper (MBC &gt; 100 mug/mL). The imaging results indicate that the
      nanoparticles could interact with bacterial surfaces and kill bacteria by
      inducing reactive oxygen species' accumulation and disrupting cell walls. The
      protective activities of Cu(OH)2 nanowires and Cu3(PO4)2 nanosheets were 59.8%
      and 63.2%, respectively, similar to thiodiazole copper (64.4%) and better than
      the Cu4(OH)6Cl2 nanoparticles (40.2%). The therapeutic activity of Cu4(OH)6Cl2
      nanoparticles (67.1%) bested that of Cu(OH)2 nanowires (43.9%), Cu3(PO4)2
      nanosheets (56.1%), and thiodiazole copper (53.7%). Their therapeutic and
      protective activities for control of kiwifruit bacterial canker differed in vivo,
      which was related to their sizes and morphologies. This study suggests these
      copper-based nanoparticles as alternatives to conventional bactericides for
      controlling kiwifruit diseases.

LID - 10.3390/antibiotics11070888 [doi]
AB  - The Prevotella genus is a normal constituent of the oral microbiota, and is
      commonly isolated from mechanically treated polymicrobial infections. However,
      antibiotic treatment is necessary for some patients. This study compared the
      antibiotic susceptibility and the presence of resistance genes in clinical oral
      isolates of P. intermedia, P. nigrescens, and P. melaninogenica. Antibiotic
      susceptibility was assessed using the agar dilution method. PCR confirmed the
      species and resistance gene frequency in the Prevotella species. The frequencies 
      of species P. intermedia, P. nigrescens, and P. melaninogenica were 30.2%, 45.7%,
      and 24.1%, respectively. No isolates of P. intermedia were resistant to
      amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, tetracycline, or clindamycin. P. nigrescens and P.
      melaninogenica were resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and tetracycline at 
      frequencies of 40% and 20%, respectively. P. intermedia was resistant to
      metronidazole at a frequency of 30%, P. nigrescens at 20%, and P. melaninogenica 
      at 40%. P. nigrescens and P. melaninogenica were resistant to 50% and 10%
      clindamycin, respectively. The gene most frequently detected was tetQ, at 43.3%, 
      followed by tetM at 36.6%, blaTEM at 26.6%, ermF at 20%, cfxA, cfxA2, and nimAB
      at 16.6%, and nimAEFI at 3.3%. P. nigrescens was the species with the highest
      resistance to antibiotics such as amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, amoxicillin, and
      clindamycin, in addition to being the species with the largest number of genes
      compared to P. intermedia and P. melaninogenica.

TI  - Occurrence of Serratia marcescens Carrying blaIMP-26 and mcr-9 in Southern China:
      New Insights in the Evolution of Megaplasmid IMP-26.
LID - 869 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/antibiotics11070869 [doi]
AB  - The spread of multidrug-resistant enterobacteria strains has posed a significant 
      concern in public health, especially when the strain harbors
      metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL)-encoding and mobilized colistin resistance (mcr)
      genes as such genetic components potentially mediate multidrug resistance. Here
      we report an IncHI2/2A plasmid carrying blaIMP-26 and mcr-9 in
      multidrug-resistant Serratia marcescens human isolates YL4. Antimicrobial
      susceptibility testing was performed by the broth microdilution method. According
      to the results, S. marcescens YL4 was resistant to several antimicrobials,
      including beta-lactams, fluorquinolones, sulfanilamide, glycylcycline, and
      aminoglycosides, except for amikacin. To investigate the plasmid further, we
      conducted whole-genome sequencing and sequence analysis. As shown, S. marcescens 
      YL4 possessed a circular chromosome with 5,171,477 bp length and two plasmids,
      pYL4.1 (321,744 bp) and pYL4.2 (46,771 bp). Importantly, sharing high similarity 
      with plasmids pZHZJ1 and pIMP-26, pYL4.1 has an IncHI2/2A backbone holding a
      variable region containing blaIMP-26, mcr-9, and two copies of blaTEM-1B. After
      comprehensively comparing relevant plasmids, we proposed an evolutionary pathway 
      originating from ancestor pZHZJ1. Then, via an acquisition of the mcr-9 element
      and a few recombination events, this plasmid eventually evolved into pYL4.1 and
      pIMP-26 through two different pathways. In addition, the phage-like plasmid
      pYL4.2 also carried a blaTEM-1B gene. Remarkably, this study first identified a
      multidrug-resistant S. marcescens strain co-harboring blaIMP-26 and mcr-9 on a
      megaplasmid pYL4.1 and also included a proposed evolutionary pathway of epidemic 
      megaplasmids carrying blaIMP-26.

TI  - Association between Augmented Renal Clearance and Inadequate Vancomycin
      Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Targets in Chinese Adult Patients: A Prospective 
      Observational Study.
LID - 837 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/antibiotics11070837 [doi]
AB  - This study aimed to examine the risk factors of augmented renal clearance (ARC)
      and the association between ARC and vancomycin pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic
      (PK/PD) indices in Chinese adult patients. A prospective, observational,
      multicenter study was conducted, and 414 adult patients undergoing vancomycin
      therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) were enrolled. Clinical and PK/PD data were
      compared between ARC and non-ARC groups. Independent risk factors were examined
      using a multivariate logistic regression analysis. The ARC and augmented renal
      clearance in trauma intensive care (ARCTIC) scoring systems were evaluated.
      Eighty-eight of the enrolled patients (88/414, 21.3%) had ARC before vancomycin
      therapy. Patients with ARC were more likely to have subtherapeutic vancomycin
      PK/PD indices, including trough concentration (p = 0.003) and 24 h area under the
      concentration-time curve (AUC24) to minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) ratio 
      (p &lt; 0.001). Male sex (OR = 2.588), age &lt; 50 years (OR = 2.713), overweight
      (OR = 2.072), receiving mechanical ventilation (OR = 1.785), enteral nutrition
      (OR = 2.317), neutrophil percentage (OR = 0.975), and cardiovascular diseases (OR
      = 0.281) were significantly associated with ARC. In conclusion, ARC is associated
      with subtherapeutic vancomycin trough concentration and AUC24/MIC; therefore,
      higher than routine doses may be needed. Risk factors and ARC risk scoring
      systems are valuable for early identification.

      Isolated from Intensive Care Unit Patients in Jordanian Hospitals.
LID - 835 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/antibiotics11070835 [doi]
AB  - Acinetobacter baumannii is a common cause of healthcare-associated infections
      (HAI) worldwide, mostly occurring in intensive care units (ICUs).
      Extended-spectrum beta lactamases (ESBL)-positive A. baumannii strains have
      emerged as highly resistant to most currently used antimicrobial agents,
      including carbapenems. The most common mechanism for carbapenem resistance in
      this species is beta-lactamase-mediated resistance. Carbapenem-hydrolyzing class 
      D oxacillinases are widespread among multidrug-resistant (MDR) A. baumannii
      strains. The present study was conducted to determine the presence and
      distribution of blaOXA genes among multidrug-resistant A. baumannii isolated from
      ICU patients and genes encoding insertion sequence (IS-1) in these isolates.
      Additionally, the plasmid DNA profiles of these isolates were determined. A total
      of 120 clinical isolates of A. baumannii from various ICU clinical specimens of
      four main Jordanian hospitals were collected. Bacterial isolate identification
      was confirmed by biochemical testing and antibiotic sensitivity was then
      assessed. PCR amplification and automated sequencing were carried out to detect
      the presence of blaOXA-51, blaOXA-23, blaOXA-24, and blaOXA-58 genes, and ISAba1 
      insertion sequence. Out of the 120 A. baumannii isolates, 95% of the isolates
      were resistant to three or more classes of the antibiotics tested and were
      identified as MDR. The most frequent resistance of the isolates was against
      piperacillin (96.7%), cephalosporins (97.5%), and beta-lactam/beta-lactamase
      inhibitor combinations antibiotics (95.8%). There were 24 (20%) ESBL-producing
      isolates. A co-existence of blaOXA-51 gene and ISAba1 in all the 24
      ESBL-producing isolates was determined. In addition, in the 24 ESBL-producing
      isolates, 21 (87.5%) carried blaOXA-51 and blaOXA-23 genes, 1 (4.2%) carried
      blaOXA-51 and blaOXA-24, but all were negative for the blaOXA-58 gene. Plasmid
      DNA profile A and profile B were the most common (29%) in ESBL-positive MDR A.
      baumannii isolates while plasmid DNA profile A was the most common in the
      ESBL-negative isolates. In conclusion, there was an increase in prevalence of
      MDR-A. baumannii in ICU wards in Jordanian hospitals, especially those having an 
      ESBL phenotype. Thus, identification of ESBL genes is necessary for the
      surveillance of their transmission in hospitals.

TI  - Predictors of Early Language Outcomes in Children with Connexin 26 Hearing Loss
      across Three Countries.
LID - 990 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/children9070990 [doi]
AB  - GJB2-associated hearing loss (GJB2-HL) is the most common genetic cause of
      hearing loss in children. However, little is known about the clinical
      characteristics and early language outcomes in population-oriented samples
      including children with different degrees of hearing loss. Insight into these
      characteristics are relevant for the counselling of parents. Our sample consisted
      of 66 children at approximately 2 years of age (17-32 months) with bilateral
      hearing loss due to GJB2 from three population-based cohorts in Austria,
      Australia and the Netherlands. Predictors of early vocabulary, including
      demographic, audiological, genetic and intervention variables and the role of
      medical comorbidities and nonverbal cognition were examined. The vocabulary
      scores of children with GJB2-HL were approximately 0.7 standard deviations (SDs) 
      below the norms of children with typical hearing. Age at access to
      family-centered early intervention and first-born position among siblings
      predicted language outcomes, whereas the degree of hearing loss and genetic
      subtype were not significantly correlated with expressive vocabulary. In children
      with GJB2-HL, early access to family-centered early intervention significantly
      affected language outcomes at the age of two.

TI  - Effects of Anonymity versus Examinee Name on a Measure of Depressive Symptoms in 
      Adolescents.
LID - 972 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/children9070972 [doi]
AB  - There is evidence in the literature that anonymity when investigating individual 
      variables could increase the objectivity of the measurement of some psychosocial 
      constructs. However, there is a significant gap in the literature on the
      theoretical and methodological usefulness of simultaneously assessing the same
      measurement instrument across two groups, with one group remaining anonymous and 
      a second group revealing identities using names. Therefore, the aim of this study
      was to compare the psychometric characteristics of a measure of depressive
      symptoms in two groups of adolescents as a consequence of identification or
      anonymity at the time of answering the measuring instrument. The participants
      were 189 adolescents from Metropolitan Lima; classrooms were randomly assigned to
      the identified group (n = 89; application requesting to write one's own name) or 
      to the anonymous group (n = 100; application under usual conditions), who
      responded to the Childhood Depression Inventory, short version (CDI-S).
      Univariate characteristics (mean, dispersion, distribution), dimensionality,
      reliability, and measurement invariance were analyzed. Specific results in each
      of the statistical and psychometric aspects evaluated indicated strong
      psychometric similarity. The practical and ethical implications of the present
      results for professional and research activity are discussed.

TI  - Taurine Attenuates Oxidized Fish Oil-Induced Oxidative Stress and Lipid
      Metabolism Disorder in Mice.
LID - 1391 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/antiox11071391 [doi]
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the effect of dietary taurine on
      lipid metabolism and liver injury in mice fed a diet high in oxidized fish oil.
      The ICR mice (six weeks old) were randomly assigned to six groups and fed
      different diets for 10 weeks: control (CON), normal plus 15% fresh fish oil diet 
      (FFO), normal plus 15% oxidized fish oil diet (OFO), or OFO plus 0.6% (TAU1),
      0.9% (TAU2) or 1.2% (TAU3) taurine. Compared to the CON group, OFO mice showed
      increased liver index, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and malondialdehyde (MDA)
      levels in serum (p &lt; 0.05). In addition, OFO mice had increased cholesterol
      (CHOL)/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and decreased
      HDL-C/low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and n-6/n-3 polyunsaturated
      fatty acid (PUFA) ratio in serum (p &lt; 0.05) compared with CON mice. Notably,
      dietary taurine ameliorated the liver index and AST and MDA levels in serum and
      liver in a more dose-dependent manner than OFO mice. In addition, compared to OFO
      mice, decreased levels of CHOL and ratio of CHOL/HDL-C and n-6 PUFA/n-3 PUFA in
      serum were found in TAU3-fed mice. Supplementation with TAU2 and TAU3 increased
      the relative mRNA expression levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
      alpha, adipose triglyceride lipase, lipoprotein lipase, hormone-sensitive lipase 
      and carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 in liver compared with the OFO group (p
      &lt; 0.05). Moreover, impaired autophagy flux was detected in mice fed with the
      OFO diet, and this was prevented by taurine. These findings suggested that
      dietary taurine might provide a potential therapeutic choice against oxidative
      stress and lipid metabolism disorder.

TI  - Oxidative Stress and Psychiatric Disorders: Evidence from the Bidirectional
      Mendelian Randomization Study.

LID - 10.3390/antiox11071386 [doi]
AB  - Observational studies have shown that oxidative stress is highly related to
      psychiatric disorders, while its cause-effect remains unclear. To this end, a
      Mendelian randomization study was performed to investigate the causal
      relationship between oxidative stress and psychiatric disorders. On the one hand,
      all causal effects of oxidative stress injury biomarkers (OSIB) on psychiatric
      disorders were not significant (p &gt; 0.0006), while the findings suggested that
      part of OSIB was nominally associated with the risk of psychiatric disorders
      (causal OR of uric acid (UA), 0.999 for bipolar disorder (BD), and 1.002 for
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); OR of catalase was 0.903 for
      anorexia nervosa (AN); OR of albumin was 1.162 for autism; p &lt; 0.05). On the
      other hand, major depressive disorder (MDD) was significantly associated with
      decreased bilirubin (p = 2.67 x 10(-4)); ADHD was significantly associated with
      decreased ascorbate (p = 4.37 x 10(-5)). Furthermore, there were also some
      suggestively causal effects of psychiatric disorders on OSIB (BD on decreased UA 
      and increased retinol; MDD on increased UA and decreased ascorbate; schizophrenia
      on decreased UA, increased retinol and albumin; ADHD on increased UA, and
      decreased catalase, albumin, and bilirubin; AN on decreased UA). This work
      presented evidence of potential causal relationships between oxidative stress and
      psychiatric disorders.

TI  - Taurine Alleviates Cadmium-Induced Toxicity via Genetically Specific Strategies
      in Two Strains of Gibel Carp (Carassius gibelio).
LID - 1381 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/antiox11071381 [doi]
AB  - Our previous studies in gibel carp (Carassius gibelio) have shown that cadmium
      (Cd) exposure elicits deleterious effects depending on the genetic background,
      and thus we hypothesized that mitigation via nutritional intervention may vary
      between strains. Therefore, two gibel carp strains (the A and F strains) were fed
      diets supplemented with 0% or 1% taurine for 8 weeks prior to 96 h Cd exposure,
      and the responses of antioxidant pathways, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress,
      autophagy, and apoptosis were investigated. The results showed that taurine
      supplementation had no effect on the growth performance of gibel carp. After Cd
      exposure, histological damage to mitochondria and ER, induction of oxidative
      stress and antioxidant responses, occurrence of ER stress, and apoptotic signals 
      were observed in the livers. Upon the diet effects, taurine supplementation
      alleviated the ER-stress-induced autophagy and apoptosis after Cd exposure and
      stimulated antioxidant pathways. Regarding the difference between strains,
      taurine played a protective role in alleviating Cd toxicity through the
      antioxidant response, ER stress, and autophagy in the F strain, whereas such
      effects were achieved by the attenuation of apoptosis in the A strain. Taken
      together, our results demonstrate the potential use of taurine in the mitigation 
      of heavy metal toxicity in aquatic organisms.

TI  - Hydrogen Sulfide Regulates Irisin and Glucose Metabolism in Myotubes and Muscle
      of HFD-Fed Diabetic Mice.
LID - 1369 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/antiox11071369 [doi]
AB  - Irisin, a novel myokine, is secreted by the muscle following proteolytic cleavage
      of fibronectin type III domain containing 5 (FNDC5) and is considered a novel
      regulator of glucose homeostasis. Cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE) produces
      hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and is involved in glucose homeostasis. We examined the
      hypothesis that H2S deficiency leads to decreased FNDC5 and irisin secretion, and
      thereby alters glucose metabolism. High-fat diet-fed mice exhibited elevated
      blood glucose and significantly reduced levels of CSE, H2S, and PGC-1alpha, with 
      decreased FNDC5/irisin levels and increased oxidative stress in the muscle
      compared with those of normal diet-fed mice (control). High glucose or palmitate 
      decreases CSE/PGC-1alpha/FNDC5 levels and glucose uptake in myotubes. Inhibitors 
      (propargylglycine and aminooxyacetate) of H2S producing enzymes or CSE siRNA
      significantly decreased levels of H2S and FNDC5 along with PGC-1alpha; similar
      H2S-deficient conditions also resulted in decreased GLUT4 and glucose uptake. The
      levels of H2S, PGC-1alpha, and FNDC5 and glucose uptake were significantly
      upregulated after treatment with l-cysteine or an H2S donor. Myoblast
      differentiation showed upregulation of PGC-1alpha and FNDC5, which was consistent
      with the increased expression of CSE/H2S. These findings suggest that the
      upregulation of H2S levels can have beneficial effects on glucose homeostasis via
      activation of the PGC-1alpha/FNDC5/irisin signaling pathway.

TI  - Comprehensive Expression Analyses of Plastidial Thioredoxins of Arabidopsis
      thaliana Indicate a Main Role of Thioredoxin m2 in Roots.
LID - 1365 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/antiox11071365 [doi]
AB  - Thioredoxins (TRXs) f and m are redox proteins that regulate key chloroplast
      processes. The existence of several isoforms of TRXs f and m indicates that these
      redox players have followed a specialization process throughout evolution.
      Current research efforts are focused on discerning the signalling role of the
      different TRX types and their isoforms in chloroplasts. Nonetheless, little is
      known about their function in non-photosynthetic plastids. For this purpose, we
      have carried out comprehensive expression analyses by using Arabidopsis
      thaliana&amp;nbsp;TRXf (f1 and f2) and TRXm (m1, m2, m3 and m4) genes
      translationally fused to the green fluorescence protein (GFP). These analyses
      showed that TRX m has different localisation patterns inside chloroplasts,
      together with a putative dual subcellular localisation of TRX f1. Apart from
      mesophyll cells, these TRXs were also observed in reproductive organs, stomatal
      guard cells and roots. We also investigated whether photosynthesis, stomatal
      density and aperture or root structure were affected in the TRXs f and m
      loss-of-function Arabidopsis mutants. Remarkably, we immunodetected TRX m2 and
      the Calvin-Benson cycle fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (cFBP1) in roots. After
      carrying out in vitro redox activation assays of cFBP1 by plastid TRXs, we
      propose that cFBP1 might be activated by TRX m2 in root plastids.

TI  - 3,4',5-Trimethoxy-trans-stilbene Alleviates Endothelial Dysfunction in Diabetic
      and Obese Mice via Activation of the AMPK/SIRT1/eNOS Pathway.
LID - 1286 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/antiox11071286 [doi]
AB  - 3,4',5-trimethoxy-trans-stilbene (TMS) is a methoxylated derivative of
      resveratrol. Previous studies showed the vaso-protective effects of resveratrol; 
      nevertheless, research on this derivative is scarce. The current study aimed to
      explore whether TMS can alleviate endothelial dysfunction in diabetic and obese
      mice, along with the underlying mechanisms. Thoracic aortas isolated from male
      C57BL/6J mice and primary cultures of rat aortic endothelial cells were treated
      with high glucose with or without TMS. High glucose exposure impaired
      acetylcholine-induced endothelium-dependent relaxations, down-regulated NO
      bioavailability and the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/Sirtuin 1
      (SIRT1)/endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) pathway, increased endoplasmic
      reticulum (ER) stress and oxidative stress, which were reversed by TMS treatment.
      Moreover, the protective effects of TMS were abolished by Compound C (AMPK
      inhibitor), and EX527 (SIRT1 inhibitor). The mice were fed with high-fat diet
      (60% kcal% fat) for 14 weeks to establish a diabetic and obese model, and were
      orally administered TMS (10 mg/kg/day) in the last 4 weeks. Chronic TMS treatment
      alleviated endothelial dysfunction via enhancing the AMPK/SIRT1/eNOS pathway and 
      attenuated oxidative stress and ER stress in aortas of diet-induced obese mice.
      In summary, our study reveals the potent vaso-protective effect of TMS and its
      therapeutic potential against endothelial dysfunction in metabolic disorders.

TI  - Selenoprotein K Is Essential for the Migration and Phagocytosis of Immature
      Dendritic Cells.
LID - 1264 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/antiox11071264 [doi]
AB  - Selenoprotein K (SELENOK) is an endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS)-regulated
      protein required for the calcium (Ca(2+)) flux-mediated migration of T cells and 
      neutrophils, and the migration and phagocytosis of macrophages and microglia.
      However, the effect of SELENOK on the regulation of the immune function of
      dendritic cells (DCs), including immature DCs (imDCs) and mature DCs (mDCs), is
      still unclear. In this study, imDCs prepared from SELENOK knockout mice were used
      to evaluate the effect of SELENOK on the migration and phagocytosis of imDCs. The
      results showed that ERS-induced downregulation of imDCs phenotypic markers led to
      a reduction in Ras homolog gene family member A (RhoA)-dependent migration and
      enhanced Ca(2+)/CD205-mediated phagocytosis. SELENOK deficiency-induced
      upregulation of selenoprotein S (SELENOS) attenuated ERS levels in imDCs. An
      increase in Ca(2+) levels resulted in increased migration and decreased
      phagocytosis with or without ERS conditions. The migration was RhoA-dependent,
      and Ca(2+) or CD205 was associated with regulating phagocytosis in imDCs. Our
      study found that SELENOK is required for imDC migration and phagocytosis.

TI  - Comparative Physiological and Transcriptomic Analyses Reveal Mechanisms of
      Exogenous Spermidine-Induced Tolerance to Low-Iron Stress in Solanum lycopersicum
      L.
LID - 1260 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/antiox11071260 [doi]
AB  - Iron (Fe) deficiency in plants is a major problem in agriculture. Therefore, we
      investigated both the physiological features and molecular mechanisms of plants' 
      response to low-Fe (LF) stress along with the mitigation of LF with exogenous
      spermidine (Spd) in tomato plants. The results showed that exogenous Spd foliar
      application relieved the suppressing effect of LF stress on tomato plants by
      regulating the photosynthetic efficiency, chlorophyll metabolism, antioxidant
      levels, organic acid secretion, polyamine metabolism and osmoregulatory systems. 
      Analysis of transcriptomic sequencing results revealed that the differentially
      expressed genes of iron-deficiency stress were mainly enriched in the pathways of
      phytohormone signaling, starch and sucrose metabolism and phenyl propane
      biosynthesis in both leaves and roots. Moreover, Spd-induced promotion of growth 
      under LF stress was associated with upregulation in the expression of some
      transcription factors that are related to growth hormone response in leaves (GH3,
      SAUR, ARF) and ethylene-related signaling factors in roots (ERF1, ERF2). We
      propose that traits associated with changes in low-iron-tolerance genes can
      potentially be used to improve tomato production. The study provides a
      theoretical basis for dealing with the iron deficiency issue to develop efficient
      nutrient management strategies in protected tomato cultivation.

AB  - The current study aims to evaluate the probiotic potential of lactic acid
      bacteria isolated from infant feces, and select candidates to be used as
      potential antioxidants for the treatment of oxidative stress-related diseases; To
      meet the criteria for probiotic attributes, the isolates were subjected to
      various in vitro tests and 16S rRNA genotypic characterization. Besides,
      anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects of selected isolates were separately
      assessed by real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot; The selected strains
      belonged to Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum and
      Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus. Notably, three selected strains (L. gasseri FWJL-4,
      L. plantarum Fjias-5 and L. rhamnosus FSJ-13) particularly L. gasseri FWJL-4
      significantly down-regulated mRNA expression levels of tumor necrosis factor
      alpha (TNFalpha), Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-1beta. Most importantly, three
      strains-treated RAW 264.7 murine macrophages displayed enhanced activities of
      antioxidant enzymes and reduced H2O2 production, which were associated with the
      enhanced expression levels of nuclear factor-erythroid 2 related factor 2 and
      heme oxygenase-1; Three selected strains, particularly L. gasseri FWJL-4, are
      good candidates that merit additional in vivo investigation for the validation
      and application of their health-promoting effects.

TI  - Effects of Stocking Density on the Growth Performance, Physiological Parameters, 
      Redox Status and Lipid Metabolism of Micropterus salmoides in Integrated
      Rice-Fish Farming Systems.
LID - 1215 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/antiox11071215 [doi]
AB  - Stocking density has been identified as one of the main factors affecting fish
      growth, welfare and behavior. However, few studies have focused on the effects of
      stocking density on fish health in integrated rice-fish farming systems. Thus,
      the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of different stocking densities
      on the growth performance, physiological parameters, redox status and lipid
      metabolism of Micropterus salmoides in an integrated rice-fish farming system.
      The fish were reared at three densities: low density (LD, 40 g/m(3)), medium
      density (MD, 80 g/m(3)) and high density (HD, 120 g/m(3)) for 90 days. At the end
      of the experiment, fish reared in the MD and HD groups showed lower growth
      performance than those from the LD group. The HD treatment significantly altered 
      the physiological parameters, including glucose and lactate. Meanwhile, the HD
      treatment induced oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation after 90 days of
      farming. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis revealed that HD treatment led to
      abnormal lipid metabolism. Interestingly, we found the suppression of three key
      pathways related to lipid metabolism, including the PPAR, insulin and
      adipocytokine signaling pathways, in the HD group. Overall, our data indicated
      that the HD treatment inhibited growth and caused physiological responses,
      oxidative stress and abnormal hepatic lipid metabolism in M. salmoides in an
      integrated rice-fish farming system.

TI  - Distinct PKA Signaling in Cytosolic and Mitochondrial Compartments in
      Electrically Paced Atrial Myocytes.
LID - 2261 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/cells11142261 [doi]
AB  - Protein kinase A (PKA) is a key nodal signaling molecule that regulates a wide
      range of cellular functions in the cytosol and mitochondria. The distribution of 
      A-kinase anchoring proteins that tether PKA, the local interaction with
      degradation molecules, and regulation by Ca(2+), may lead to distinct
      spatiotemporal cAMP/PKA signaling in these compartments. In this work, FRET-based
      sensors were used to investigate PKA signaling in the cytosol, outer
      mitochondrial membrane (OMM), and mitochondrial matrix (MM) and its crosstalk
      with Ca(2+) in response to electrical stimulation of cultured rabbit atrial
      cells. A gradual decrease in PKA activity eliminating the ability of the atrial
      cells to respond to physiological electrical stimulation, was observed upon
      treatment of cells with H-89. Chelation of intracellular Ca(2+) by BAPTA reduced 
      PKA activity and diminished its response to forskolin, an AC stimulator. Under
      basal conditions, PKA activity in response to forskolin was lower in the OMM
      compared to the cytosol and MM. In response to electrical stimulation in the
      presence of ISO, distinct compartmentalization of PKA activity was observed, with
      higher activity in the cytosol and MM than in the OMM. Thus, distinct
      Ca(2+)-dependent spatiotemporal cAMP/PKA signaling exists in atrial cells, likely
      mediating its excitation and mitochondrial function.

TI  - Effects of Air Pollution on Cellular Senescence and Skin Aging.
LID - 2220 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/cells11142220 [doi]
AB  - The human skin is exposed daily to different environmental factors such as air
      pollutants and ultraviolet (UV) light. Air pollution is considered a harmful
      environmental risk to human skin and is known to promote aging and inflammation
      of this tissue, leading to the onset of skin disorders and to the appearance of
      wrinkles and pigmentation issues. Besides this, components of air pollution can
      interact synergistically with ultraviolet light and increase the impact of damage
      to the skin. However, little is known about the modulation of air pollution on
      cellular senescence in skin cells and how this can contribute to skin aging. In
      this review, we are summarizing the current state of knowledge about air
      pollution components, their involvement in the processes of cellular senescence
      and skin aging, as well as the current therapeutic and cosmetic interventions
      proposed to prevent or mitigate the effects of air pollution in the skin.

TI  - Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Suppresses AMPK and Sensitizes Cancer Cells to 
      Pyroptosis under Energy Stress.
LID - 2208 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/cells11142208 [doi]
AB  - Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is implicated in tumor metastasis and
      therapeutic resistance. It remains a challenge to target cancer cells that have
      undergone EMT. The Snail family of key EMT-inducing transcription factors
      directly binds to and transcriptionally represses not only epithelial genes but
      also a myriad of additional genomic targets that may carry out significant
      biological functions. Therefore, we reasoned that EMT inherently causes various
      concomitant phenotypes, some of which may create targetable vulnerabilities for
      cancer treatment. In the present study, we found that Snail transcription factors
      bind to the promoters of multiple genes encoding subunits of the AMP-activated
      protein kinase (AMPK) complex, and expression of AMPK genes was markedly
      downregulated by EMT. Accordingly, high AMPK expression in tumors correlated with
      epithelial cell markers and low AMPK expression in tumors was strongly associated
      with adverse prognosis. AMPK is the principal sensor of cellular energy status.
      In response to energy stress, AMPK is activated and critically reprograms
      cellular metabolism to restore energy homeostasis and maintain cell survival. We 
      showed that activation of AMPK by energy stress was severely impaired by EMT.
      Consequently, EMT cancer cells became hypersensitive to a variety of energy
      stress conditions and primarily underwent pyroptosis, a regulated form of
      necrotic cell death. Collectively, the study suggests that EMT impedes the
      activation of AMPK signaling induced by energy stress and sensitizes cancer cells
      to pyroptotic cell death under energy stress conditions. Therefore, while EMT
      promotes malignant progression, it concurrently induces collateral
      vulnerabilities that may be therapeutically exploited.

TI  - Mechanisms for Bile Acids CDCA- and DCA-Stimulated Hepatic Spexin Expression.
LID - 2159 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/cells11142159 [doi]
AB  - Spexin (SPX) is a novel peptide involved in glucose and lipid metabolism and
      suppresses hepatic total bile acid levels by inhibiting hepatic cholesterol
      7alpha-hydroxylase 1 expression. As important mediators for
      glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and lipid metabolism, the effects of bile acids on SPX
      expression is yet to be understood. By using SMMC7721 and BEL-7402 cell lines, we
      screened the effects of bile acids and found that chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA)
      and deoxycholic acid (DCA) can stimulate SPX gene transcription. Both CDCA and
      DCA were able to stimulate SPX mRNA expression in the liver but not colon and
      ileum in mice. In SMMC7721 and BEL-7402 cells, CDCA- and DCA-induced SPX promoter
      activity was mimicked by bile acid receptor FXR and TGR5 activation and
      suppressed by FXR and TGR5 silencing. Adenylate cyclase (AC)/cyclic adenosine
      monophosphate (cAMP) activators significantly increased SPX promoter activity
      whereas the inhibitors for AC/CAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) and mitogen-activated
      protein kinases (MAPK) pathway attenuated CDCA- and DCA-induced SPX
      transcription. Thus, CDCA and DCA stimulate SPX expression at the hepatic level
      through FXR and TGR5 mediated AC/cAMP/PKA and MAPK cascades.

TI  - Atherosclerosis Plaque Reduction by Lycopene Is Mediated by Increased Energy
      Expenditure through AMPK and PPARalpha in ApoE KO Mice Fed with a High Fat Diet.
LID - 973 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/biom12070973 [doi]
AB  - Lycopene is a carotenoid found in tomatoes that has potent antioxidant activity. 
      The Mediterranean diet is particularly rich in lycopene, which has well-known
      beneficial effects on cardiovascular health. We tested the effects of lycopene
      extract in a group of 20 ApoE knockout mice, fed with a high fat western diet for
      14 weeks. Starting from week 3 and up to week 14, the mice were randomly divided 
      into two groups that received lycopene (n = 10) by oral suspension every day at
      the human equivalent dose of 60 mg/day (0.246 mg/mouse/day), or the vehicle
      solution (n = 10). The lycopene administration reduced triglycerides and
      cholesterol blood levels starting from week 6 and continuing through to the end
      of the experiment (p &lt; 0.001). This reduction was mediated by an enhanced
      liver expression of PPAR-alpha and AMPK-alpha and reduced SREBP levels (p &lt;
      0.0001). As a histological red-out, the extent of atherosclerotic plaques and the
      intima-media thickness in the aorta were significantly reduced by lycopene. In
      this context, lycopene augmented the Nrf-2 positivity staining in the
      endothelium, thereby confirming that its antioxidant activity was mediated by
      this nuclear factor. The positive results obtained in this pre-clinical model
      further support the use of lycopene extracts to reduce atherosclerosis.

TI  - Yeast Protein Kinase A Isoforms: A Means of Encoding Specificity in the Response 
      to Diverse Stress Conditions?
LID - 958 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/biom12070958 [doi]
AB  - Eukaryotic cells have developed a complex circuitry of signalling molecules which
      monitor changes in their intra- and extracellular environments. One of the most
      widely studied signalling pathways is the highly conserved cyclic AMP
      (cAMP)/protein kinase A (PKA) pathway, which is a major glucose sensing circuit
      in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. PKA activity regulates diverse targets in 
      yeast, positively activating the processes that are associated with rapid cell
      growth (e.g., fermentative metabolism, ribosome biogenesis and cell division) and
      negatively regulating the processes that are associated with slow growth, such as
      respiratory growth, carbohydrate storage and entry into stationary phase. As in
      higher eukaryotes, yeast has evolved complexity at the level of the PKA catalytic
      subunit, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae expresses three isoforms, denoted Tpk1-3.
      Despite evidence for isoform differences in multiple biological processes, the
      molecular basis of PKA signalling specificity remains poorly defined, and many
      studies continue to assume redundancy with regards to PKA-mediated regulation.
      PKA has canonically been shown to play a key role in fine-tuning the cellular
      response to diverse stressors; however, recent studies have now begun to
      interrogate the requirement for individual PKA catalytic isoforms in coordinating
      distinct steps in stress response pathways. In this review, we discuss the known 
      non-redundant functions of the Tpk catalytic subunits and the evolving picture of
      how these isoforms establish specificity in the response to different stress
      conditions.

TI  - Combined Analysis of BSA-Seq Based Mapping, RNA-Seq, and Metabolomic Unraveled
      Candidate Genes Associated with Panicle Grain Number in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).
LID - 918 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/biom12070918 [doi]
AB  - Rice grain yield is a complex and highly variable quantitative trait consisting
      of several key components, including the grain weight, the effective panicles per
      unit area, and the grain number per panicle (GNPP). The GNPP is a significant
      contributor to grain yield controlled by multiple genes (QTL) and is crucial for 
      improvement. Attempts have been made to find genes for this trait, which has
      always been a challenging and arduous task through conventional methods. We
      combined a BSA analysis, RNA profiling, and a metabolome analysis in the present 
      study to identify new candidate genes involved in the GNPP. The F2 population
      from crossing R4233 (high GNPP) and Ce679 (low GNPP) revealed a frequency
      distribution fitting two segregated genes. Three pools, including low, middle,
      and high GNPP, were constructed and a BSA analysis revealed six candidate regions
      spanning 5.38 Mb, containing 739 annotated genes. Further, a conjunctive analysis
      of BSA-Seq and RNA-Seq showed 31 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the
      candidate intervals. Subsequently, a metabolome analysis showed 1024 metabolites,
      with 71 significantly enriched, including 44 up and 27 downregulated in Ce679 vs.
      R4233. A KEGG enrichment analysis of these 31 DEGs and 71 differentially enriched
      metabolites (DEMs) showed two genes, Os12g0102100 and Os01g0580500, significantly
      enriched in the metabolic pathways' biosynthesis of secondary metabolites,
      cysteine and methionine metabolism, and fatty acid biosynthesis. Os12g0102100,
      which encodes for the alcohol dehydrogenase superfamily and a zinc-containing
      protein, is a novel gene whose contribution to the GNPP is not yet elucidated.
      This gene coding for mitochondrial trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase is involved in the
      biosynthesis of myristic acid, also known as tetradecanoic acid. The Os01g0580500
      coding for the enzyme 1-aminoclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase (OsACO7) is
      responsible for the final step of the ethylene biosynthesis pathway through the
      conversion of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) into ethylene. Unlike
      Os12g0102100, this gene was significantly upregulated in R4233, downregulated in 
      Ce679, and significantly enriched in two of the three metabolite pathways. This
      result pointed out that these two genes are responsible for the difference in the
      GNPP in the two cultivars, which has never been identified. Further validation
      studies may disclose the physiological mechanisms through which they regulate the
      GNPP in rice.

TI  - Vascular Calcification and the Gut and Blood Microbiome in Chronic Kidney Disease
      Patients on Peritoneal Dialysis: A Pilot Study.
LID - 867 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/biom12070867 [doi]
AB  - Vascular calcification (VC) is a frequent condition in chronic kidney disease
      (CKD) and a well-established risk factor for the development of cardiovascular
      disease (CVD). Gut dysbiosis may contribute to CVD and inflammation in CKD
      patients. Nonetheless, the role of gut and blood microbiomes in CKD-associated VC
      remains unknown. Therefore, this pilot study aimed to explore the link between
      gut and blood microbiomes and VC in CKD patients on peritoneal dialysis (CKD-PD).
      Our results showed relative changes in specific taxa between CKD-PD patients with
      and without VC, namely Coprobacter, Coprococcus&amp;nbsp;3, Lactobacillus, and
      Eubacterium eligens group in the gut, and Cutibacterium, Pajaroellobacter,
      Devosia, Hyphomicrobium, and Pelomonas in the blood. An association between VC
      and all-cause mortality risk in CKD-PD patients was also observed, and patients
      with higher mortality risk corroborate the changes of Eubacterium eligens in the 
      gut and Devosia genus in the blood. Although we did not find differences in
      uremic toxins, intestinal translocation markers, and inflammatory parameters
      among CKD-PD patients with and without VC, soluble CD14 (sCD14), a nonspecific
      marker of monocyte activation, positively correlated with VC severity. Therefore,
      gut Eubacterium eligens group, blood Devosia, and circulating sCD14 should be
      further explored as biomarkers for VC, CVD, and mortality risk in CKD.

TI  - Let Us Give Voice to Local Farmers: Preferences for Farm-Based Strategies to
      Enhance Human-Elephant Coexistence in Africa.
LID - 1867 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ani12141867 [doi]
AB  - Local communities surrounding wildlife corridors and natural reserves often face 
      challenges related to human-wildlife coexistence. To mitigate the challenges and 
      ensure the long-term conservation of wildlife, it is important to engage local
      communities in the design of conservation strategies. By conducting 480
      face-to-face interviews in 30 villages along and adjacent to the Selous-Niassa
      Wildlife Corridor (Tanzania), we quantified farmers' preferences for farm-based
      measures to mitigate African elephant damage using choice experiments. Results
      show that farmers considered no action the least preferred option, revealing that
      they are open to trying different measures. The most preferred management
      strategy matched with the preferences of wildlife rangers in the area, suggesting
      low concern about the potential conflicts between stakeholders. However, a latent
      class model suggests that there are significant differences among responses
      triggered by farmers' previous experience with elephants, the intensity of the
      elephant damage, and the socioeconomic situation of the farmer. Results show a
      marked spatial distribution among respondents, highlighting the benefits of zone 
      management as conflicts were found to be highly context dependent. Understanding 
      the human dimension of conservation is essential for the successful planification
      and implementation of conservation strategies. Therefore, the development and
      broad utilization of methodologies to gather specific context information should 
      be encouraged.

TI  - Expression and Characterization of the Spats1 Gene and Its Response to E2/MT
      Treatment in the Chinese Soft-Shelled Turtle (Pelodiscus sinensis).
LID - 1858 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ani12141858 [doi]
AB  - Spats1 (spermatogenesis-associated, serinerich 1) has been characterized as a
      male-biased gene which acts an important role in the germ cell differentiation of
      mammals. Nevertheless, the function of Spats1 in the Chinese soft-shelled turtle 
      (P. sinensis) has not yet been reported. To initially explore the expression of
      Spats1 in P. sinensis and its response to sex steroid treatment, we cloned the
      CDS of Spats1 for the first time and analyzed its expression profile in different
      tissues, including the testes in different seasons. The Spats1 cDNA fragment is
      1201 base pairs (bp) in length and contains an open reading frame (ORF) of 849
      bp, which codes for 283 amino acids. Spats1 mRNA was highly expressed in the
      testes (p &lt; 0.01) and barely detectable in other tissues. In P. sinensis, the 
      relative expression of Spats1 also responsive to seasonal changes in testis
      development. In summer (July) and autumn (October), Spats1 gene expression was
      significantly higher in the testes than in other seasons (p &lt; 0.05). Spats1
      mRNA was found to be specifically expressed in germ cells by chemical in situ
      hybridization (CISH), and it was mainly located in primary spermatocytes (Sc1),
      secondary spermatocytes (Sc2) and spermatozoa (St). Spats1 expression in embryos 
      was not significantly changed after 17alpha-methyltestosterone (MT)and
      17beta-estradiol (E2) treatment. In adults, MT significantly induced Spats1
      expression in male P. sinensis. However, the expression of Spats1 in testes was
      not responsive to E2 treatment. In addition, the expression of Spats1 in females 
      was not affected by either MT or E2 treatment. These results imply that Spats1 is
      a male-specific expressed gene that is mainly regulated by MT and is closely
      linked to spermatogenesis and release in P. sinensis.

      Dairy Cattle in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.

LID - 10.3390/ani12141853 [doi]
AB  - In Tanzania, information on antimicrobial resistance in small-scale dairy cattle 
      is scarce. This cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the different
      levels and pattern of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), in 121 Escherichia coli
      isolated from rectal swab of 201 apparently healthy small-scale dairy cattle in
      Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Isolation and identification of E. coli were carried out
      using enrichment media, selective media, and biochemical tests. Antimicrobial
      susceptibility testing was carried out using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion
      method on Mueller-Hinton agar (Merck), according to the recommendations of
      Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). Resistance was tested against
      ampicillin, gentamicin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole,
      tetracycline, nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin and cefotaxime. Resistance to almost 
      all antimicrobial agents was observed. The agents to which resistance was
      demonstrated most frequently were ampicillin (96.7%), cefotaxime (95.0%),
      tetracycline (50.4%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (42.1%) and nalidixic acid
      (33.1%). In this case, 20 extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) producing E. 
      coli were identified. 74.4% (90/121) of the isolates were Multidrug resistant
      (MDR), ranging from a combination of three to 8 different classes. The most
      frequently observed phenotypes were AMP-SXT-CTX with a prevalence of 12.4%,
      followed by the combination AMP-CTX with 10.7% and TE-AMP-CTX and NA + TE + AMP +
      CTX with 8.3% each. The high prevalence and wide range of AMR calls for prudent
      antimicrobial use.

TI  - 10-Hydroxy-trans-2-decenoic Acid, a New Potential Feed Additive for Broiler
      Chickens to Improve Growth Performance.
LID - 1846 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ani12141846 [doi]
AB  - The purposes of this study were to explore the potential possibility of
      10-hydroxy-trans-2-decenoic acid (10-HDA) use in feeding broiler chickens. A
      total of 216 healthy 1-day-old chicks were divided into 2 treatments at random
      (diets supplemented with 0 or 40 mg/kg 10-HDA, respectively) with 6 replicates of
      18 birds each, and were then reared for 42 days. The results found that a diet
      supplemented with 10-HDA significantly increased average daily gain of broiler
      chickens in d 22~42 and d 0~42. Compared with the control group, dietary
      inclusion of 10-HDA markedly increased the serum concentrations of immunoglobulin
      (Ig) G at d 21, as well as IgM and interleukin (IL)-10 at d 42, while decreasing 
      the levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha at d 21, as well as IL-6,
      TNF-alpha, and IL-1beta at d 42. Furthermore, broiler chickens fed a diet with
      10-HDA had a higher (p &lt; 0.05) serum activity of superoxide dismutase at d 42.
      Additionally, serum malondialdehyde content also decreased notably at d 21 and d 
      42. These results made it clear that 10-HDA increased the growth performance of
      broiler chickens, possibly by enhancing immune function and antioxidant capacity.

TI  - Overexpression of DGAT2 Stimulates Lipid Droplet Formation and Triacylglycerol
      Accumulation in Bovine Satellite Cells.
LID - 1847 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ani12141847 [doi]
AB  - Intramuscular fat (IMF) is closely related to the tenderness, juiciness, and
      flavor of beef, and is an important indicator for beef quality assessment
      internationally. The main components of skeletal intramuscular fat (IMF) are
      phospholipids and triacylglycerols (TAG), and the final step of TAG biosynthesis 
      is catalyzed by diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2). To explore the effect
      of DGAT2 on the differentiation of bovine muscle satellite cells (BSCs) and its
      role in the signaling pathway related to lipid metabolism, the adenovirus
      overexpression and interference vector of the DGAT2 gene was constructed in this 
      study, and the overexpression adenovirus Ad-DGAT2 and interfering adenovirus
      sh-DGAT2 were used to infect BSCs. Overexpression of DGAT2 resulted in a
      significant increase in the contents of TAG and ADP, and the mRNA and protein
      expression levels of PPARgamma, C/EBPalpha, and SREBF1 (p &lt; 0.05). Interfering
      with the expression of DGAT2 reduced the intracellular TAG content and lipid
      droplet accumulation. Furthermore, the mRNA and protein expression levels of
      PPARgamma, C/EBPalpha, and SREBF1 (p &lt; 0.05) were significantly downregulated.
      Transcriptome sequencing showed that a total of 598 differentially expressed
      genes (DEGs) were screened in BSCs infected with Ad-DGAT2, and these DEGs
      included 292 upregulated genes and 306 downregulated genes. A total of 49 DEGs
      were screened in BSCs infected with sh-DGAT2, and these DEGs included 25
      upregulated and 24 downregulated genes. KEGG enrichment analysis showed that the 
      DEGs, after overexpression of DGAT2, were mainly enriched in the PPAR signaling
      pathway, and the fat digestion and absorption, glycerophospholipid metabolism,
      fatty acid biosynthesis, and AMPK signaling pathways. The DEGs obtained after
      interfering with DGAT2 were mainly enriched in the metabolic pathways, such as
      the PPAR signaling pathway and PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. In summary, our study 
      demonstrated that the lipid droplet formation, TAG accumulation, and adipogenic
      gene expression in BSCs overexpressing DGAT2 were higher than those in the
      control cells. These results highlight the important role of DGAT2 in regulating 
      BSCs during adipogenic transdifferentiation and underscore the complexity of
      intramuscular adipogenesis.

TI  - A Dynamic Energy Budget Model for Kuruma Shrimp Penaeus japonicus:
      Parameterization and Application in Integrated Marine Pond Aquaculture.
LID - 1828 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ani12141828 [doi]
AB  - Individual growth models can form the basis of population dynamics assessment and
      ecosystem model construction. In order to provide a basic module for an ecosystem
      model of an integrated marine aquaculture pond, an individual growth model was
      constructed for kuruma shrimp (Penaeus japonicus) based on dynamic energy budget 
      (DEB) theory. The model was first parameterized based on a covariation method
      using the Add-my-Pet (AmP) procedure. The parametric estimation model
      underestimated the ultimate abdominal length for female shrimp, and the predicted
      values of other zero-variate parameters were generally consistent with observed
      values. The relative errors of the predicted and observed values of the
      univariate data set within three geographical regions showed acceptable goodness 
      of fit. Parameter estimation achieved an overall goodness of fit with a mean
      relative error of 0.048 and a symmetric mean squared error of 0.066. A DEB model 
      was constructed using the estimated parameters, and the goodness-of-fit
      indicators (R square, mean bias and absolute and relative root mean square error)
      showed that the model was able to reproduce the growth of kuruma shrimp in terms 
      of total length and wet weight with high accuracy. The results provide data to
      support the subsequent development of integrated aquaculture management at the
      ecosystem level.

TI  - Routine Decontamination of Surfaces Relevant to Working Dogs: Neutralization of
      Superficial Coronavirus Contamination.
LID - 1823 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ani12141823 [doi]
AB  - Given the increased deployment of working dogs to settings with pathogenic
      biological agents, a safe, effective, and logistically feasible surface
      decontamination protocol is essential to protect both the animals and their human
      handlers. Our group previously found that superficial contamination on surfaces
      relevant to the working dog community, including leashes and toys, could be
      significantly reduced using a standardized wiping protocol with various cleansing
      products. To expand upon this work, we analyzed the ability of this protocol to
      decontaminate surface-deposited bovine coronavirus, which was used as a BSL2
      surrogate for SARS-CoV-2. Unsurprisingly, the physical characteristics of a given
      surface, including porosity and texture, had a significant effect on the ability 
      to recover viable virus remaining on the surface post treatment. After correcting
      for these differences, however, wiping with 70% isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and 0.5% 
      chlorhexidine performed best, reducing viral titers by &gt;3 log on plastic
      bumper toys and nylon collars, and by &gt;2 log on rubber toys and tennis balls. 
      Leather leashes and Velcro proved more difficult to decontaminate, but both still
      showed significant loss of viral contamination following wiping with IPA or
      chlorhexidine. This work (i) validates the utility of a simple protocol for the
      neutralization of viruses on several surfaces, (ii) identifies materials that are
      more difficult to decontaminate, which should, thus, be considered for removal
      from field use, and (iii) highlights the need for further development of
      protocols testing porous or textured surfaces.

TI  - Comparative Analyses of Production Performance, Meat Quality, and Gut Microbial
      Composition between Two Chinese Goose Breeds.
LID - 1815 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ani12141815 [doi]
AB  - Goose meat is consumed by consumers because it contains a relatively high
      proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). This study was conducted to
      explore the main differences in production performance, breast meat quality
      traits, and cecal microbiota compositions between the Zi goose (ZG) and Xianghai 
      flying goose (FG). The production performance and breast meat quality trait
      analyses showed that compared with the ZG, the FG had a higher right breast
      muscle index, ileum villi height/crypt depth ratio (VH/CD), and cecum
      fermentation rate (higher short-chain fatty acid (SFCA) concentration); a lower
      abdominal fat index; a higher proportion of PUFAs; and a lower shear force.
      Spearman's correlation coefficients between the cecal microbiota composition and 
      production performance indexes suggested that the genus Faecalibacterium was
      positively associated with production performance; in contrast, the genus
      Candidatus Saccharimonas was negatively correlated with production performance;
      moreover, the Ruminococcus torques group, Parasutterella, and Methanobrevibacter 
      were negatively related to the VH/CD. Taken together, in this particular trial,
      FG had better production performance, healthier meat quality traits, and better
      intestinal digestion and absorption capacities than ZG. These results not only
      provide a useful data reference for the production of healthy geese for human
      consumption but can also help guide the utilization of goose breed resources.

TI  - Analysis of Acute Nitrite Exposure on Physiological Stress Response, Oxidative
      Stress, Gill Tissue Morphology and Immune Response of Large Yellow Croaker
      (Larimichthys crocea).
LID - 1791 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ani12141791 [doi]
AB  - Nitrite is a common pollutant in aquaculture water, and nitrite toxicity that
      negatively affects aquatic species is common in aquaculture systems when the
      water quality is low. Therefore, the present research aimed to evaluate the
      effect of acute nitrite exposure on the hematological parameters, antioxidant
      enzymes, immune response, and gill morphology of large yellow croaker
      (Larimichthys crocea). The fish were randomly separated and exposed to four
      (i.e., 0, 29.36, 58.73, and 88.09 mg/L) nitrite concentrations for 48 h. The fish
      blood and gills were collected at 0, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h of nitrite exposure for
      further analysis. In hematological parameters, the results showed that the levels
      of hemoglobin, triglyceride, and total cholesterol in blood significantly
      decreased (p &lt; 0.05) in all nitrite-treated samples after 12 h, while the
      contents of methemoglobin in blood significantly increased (p &lt; 0.05) in these
      treatments. After 48 h of nitrite exposure, the levels of cortisol in serum
      showed a 94.5%, 132.1%, and 165.6% increase in fish exposed to 29.36, 58.73, and 
      88.09 mg/L nitrite, respectively. The nitrite (i.e., 29.36, 58.73, and 88.09
      mg/L) exposure significantly increased (p &lt; 0.05) the levels of antioxidant
      enzymes (i.e., catalase and glutathione) in the gill and serum after 12 h of
      exposure compared with the control. The lysozyme levels in serum decreased in the
      nitrite (i.e., 29.36, 58.73, and 88.09 mg/L) exposure samples. It was found that 
      immunoglobulin levels in the 29.36, 58.73, and 88.09 mg/L nitrite-treated samples
      (i.e., 1.86, 1.58, and 0.74 mug/mL, respectively) were lower than that of the
      control (2.56 mug/mL). In addition, the surface of the gill lamellae displayed
      deformation and contraction after 48 h of nitrite, especially in the fish exposed
      to 88.09 mg/L nitrite. These results indicate that the nitrite exposure induced
      the oxidative stress, affected the immune response, and changed the gill
      morphology, leading to nitrite poisoning in large yellow croaker.

TI  - Reproductive Hormones Mediate Intestinal Microbiota Shifts during Estrus
      Synchronization in Grazing Simmental Cows.
LID - 1751 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ani12141751 [doi]
AB  - To study shifts in the intestinal microbiota during estrus synchronization in
      ruminants, we characterized the intestinal microbiota in grazing Simmental cows
      and the possible mechanism that mediates this shift. Fourteen postpartum
      Simmental beef cows were synchronized beginning on day 0 (D0) with a controlled
      internal release device (CIDR), and cloprostenol was injected on D9 when the CIDR
      was withdrawn. Synchronization ended with timed artificial insemination on D12.
      Serum and rectal samples harvested on D0, D9, and D12 were analyzed to assess the
      reproductive hormones and microbiota. Reproductive hormones in the serum of the
      host were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The microbiota was
      characterized using 16S rRNA sequencing of the V3-V4 hypervariable region, alpha 
      diversity and beta diversity analyses (principal coordinate analysis, PCoA),
      cladogram of the linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) analysis, and
      microbiota function analysis. Levels of the reproductive hormones, except
      gonadotropin-releasing hormone (p &gt; 0.05), shifted among D0, D9, and D12 (p
      &lt; 0.05). Decreased community diversity (Chao1 and ACE) was observed on D12
      compared with D0 (p &lt; 0.05). The beta diversity (PCoA) of the microbiota
      shifted markedly among D0, D9, and D12 (p &lt; 0.05). The LEfSe analysis revealed
      shifts in the intestinal microbiota communities among D0, D9, and D12 (p &lt;
      0.05 and LDA cutoff &gt;3.0). The KEGG pathway analysis showed that carbohydrate 
      metabolism, genetic information and processing, the excretory system, cellular
      processes and signaling, immune system diseases, and the metabolism were altered 
      (p &lt; 0.05). Reproductive hormones (especially estradiol) were correlated with 
      the alpha diversity indices, beta diversity indices, and an abundance of
      biomarkers of the shifting intestinal microbiota (p &lt; 0.05). In conclusion,
      the structure, composition, and function of the intestinal microbiota were
      shifted during estrus synchronization in a grazing Simmental cow model, and these
      shifts were mediated by reproductive hormones.

TI  - Molecular mechanism of toxin neutralization in the HipBST toxin-antitoxin system 
      of Legionella pneumophila.
PG  - 4333
LID - 10.1038/s41467-022-32049-x [doi]
AB  - Toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems are ubiquitous genetic modules in bacteria and
      archaea. Here, we perform structural and biochemical characterization of the
      Legionella pneumophila effector Lpg2370, demonstrating that it is a Ser/Thr
      kinase. Together with two upstream genes, lpg2370 constitutes the tripartite
      HipBST TA. Notably, the toxin Lpg2370 (HipTLp) and the antitoxin Lpg2369 (HipSLp)
      correspond to the C-terminus and N-terminus of HipA from HipBA TA, respectively. 
      By determining crystal structures of autophosphorylated HipTLp, its complex with 
      AMP-PNP, and the structure of HipTLp-HipSLp complex, we identify residues in
      HipTLp critical for ATP binding and those contributing to its interactions with
      HipSLp. Structural analysis reveals that HipSLp binding induces a loop-to-helix
      shift in the P-loop of HipTLp, leading to the blockage of ATP binding and
      inhibition of the kinase activity. These findings establish the L. pneumophila
      effector Lpg2370 as the HipBST TA toxin and elucidate the molecular basis for
      HipT neutralization in HipBST TA.

TI  - Serendipity and Observations in Functional Neurosurgery: From James Parkinson's
      Stroke to Hamani's &amp; Lozano's Flashbacks.
PG  - 1-9
LID - 10.1159/000525794 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Serendipity and observations have a noble tradition in medicine,
      including neurology, and are responsible for many medical treatments
      (carbamazepine for tic douloureux, amantadine for Parkinson's disease, gabapentin
      for restless legs...). We aimed at examining the contribution of serendipity and 
      observations to functional neurosurgery. Scholarly publications relevant to the
      history of functional neurosurgery for movement and psychiatric disorders were
      reviewed, starting from the pre-stereotactic era. The documents were scrutinized 
      with respect to indications for surgery, surgical methods, and brain targets, in 
      view of determining whether serendipitous discoveries and other observations
      contributed to various functional neurosurgical procedures. SUMMARY: James
      Parkinson's observation that tremors disappeared in the arm of a person with
      shaking palsy after a hemiparetic stroke encouraged neurosurgeons in the first
      half of the 20th century to perform ablative procedures on central motor
      pathways. Following a lobotomy performed by Browder that extended too far
      medially in a psychiatric patient with coexisting Parkinson's disease (PD), it
      was noted that the Parkinsonian signs improved. This encouraged Russel Meyers to 
      carry out open surgery on the caudate nucleus and basal ganglia in PD. Cooper
      introduced ligation of the anterior choroidal artery as a treatment for PD
      following a surgical accident during a pedunculotomy. Cooper later started to
      perform stereotactic surgery on the ventrolateral thalamus following the
      pathological finding that an intended pallidal lesion had in fact targeted the
      thalamus. Leksell discovered the ideal location of a pallidal lesion being in the
      posteroventral area empirically, long before the advent of the basal ganglia
      model of PD. Modern Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) that started in the thalamus for
      tremor was the result of an observation by Benabid that intraoperative
      high-frequency stimulation during a thalamotomy reduced tremor. Both the
      discoveries of the anterior limbic subthalamic nucleus as a DBS target for OCD
      and the medial forebrain bundle as a DBS target for depression occurred by
      chance. Hamani and Lozano observed memory flashbacks in a patient who was
      undergoing DBS for obesity, which led to the discovery of the fornix as a
      potential DBS target for Alzheimer's disease. KEY MESSAGES: In the history of
      functional neurosurgery, serendipity and observations have resulted in
      discoveries of several procedures, brain targets for lesioning or DBS as well as 
      new clinical surgical indications. In this era of neuromodulation, this
      technology should be exquisite in allowing potential serendipitous discoveries,
      provided that clinicians remain both observant and prepared.

AB  - Excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in granulosa cells (GCs)
      plays a role in pathogenesis of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) by developing 
      oxidative stress (OS). It was shown that Sulforaphane (SFN), with known
      antioxidant properties, can have protective effects in different diseases through
      affecting the nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (NRF2) signaling
      pathway. Thus, the purpose of the current work was to examine the protective
      impact of SFN through the activation of the AMPK/AKT/NRF2 pathway against OS
      produced by H2O2 in granulosa-lutein cells (GLCs). Individuals' GLCs were
      obtained during ovum retrieval in intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles.
      First, the induced OS model was created in GLCs using H2O2 exposure. To examine
      the protective effect of SFN against OS, the cells were cultured for 24 h in
      presence or absence of SFN. Eventually, the levels of intracellular ROS and
      apoptosis were measured by flow cytometry, and genes and proteins expression
      levels of AMPK, AKT, and NRF2 were evaluated using qRT-PCR and western blotting. 
      Compared to the control group, the levels of intracellular ROS and apoptosis rose
      dramatically in GLCs with enhanced OS. SFN therapy decreased ROS and apoptosis
      levels and increased the overexpression of AMPK, AKT, and NRF2 genes and
      proteins. This study's results revealed that SFN exposure results in the
      alleviation of ROS and apoptosis levels possibly through activating the
      overexpression of genes and proteins of AMPK, AKT, and NRF2, and exerts its
      protective effects against OS in GLCs.

TI  - TRPV1 Protects Against Pressure Overload-Induced Cardiac Hypertrophy by Promoting
      Mitochondria-Associated Endoplasmic Reticulum Membranes.
LID - 10.1097/FJC.0000000000001301 [doi]
AB  - ABSTRACT: Transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) is a
      non-selective cation channel that mediates the relationship between mitochondrial
      function and pathological myocardial hypertrophy. However, its underlying
      mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate whether TRPV1
      activation improves the morphology and function of intracellular mitochondria to 
      protect cardiomyocytes after pressure overload-induced myocardial hypertrophy.
      The myocardial hypertrophy model was established by performing transverse aortic 
      constriction (TAC) surgery in C57BL/6J male mice. The data revealed that TRPV1
      activation significantly reduced myocardial hypertrophy, promoted ejection
      fraction (EF) % and fractional shortening (FS) %, and decreased the left
      ventricular internal diameter in end-diastole (LVIDd) and left ventricular
      internal diameter in end-systole (LVIDs) after TAC. Moreover, in vitro
      experiments revealed that TRPV1 reduces cardiomyocyte area and improves
      mitochondrial function by promoting mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum
      membranes (MAMs) formation in a phenylephrine (PE)-treated cardiomyocyte
      hypertrophy model. TRPV1 up-regulates the phosphorylation levels of AMP-activated
      protein kinase (AMPK) and expression of mitofusin2 (MFN2). TRPV1 function is
      blocked by single-stranded RNA interfering with silent interfering MFN2. And
      activation of TRPV1 reduced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) caused by
      PE, while disruption of MAMs by siMFN2 abolished TRPV1-mediated mitochondrial
      protection. Our findings suggest that TRPV1 effectively protects against pressure
      overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy by promoting MAM formation and conserved
      mitochondrial function via the AMPK/MFN2 pathway in cardiomyocytes.

TI  - Puerarin alleviates LPS-induced H9C2 cell injury by inducing mitochondrial
      autophagy.
LID - 10.1097/FJC.0000000000001315 [doi]
AB  - ABSTRACT: Sepsis leads to the damage of multiple organs, and thereby adversely
      affects the cardiovascular system. At present, no effective method has been found
      to treat myocardial injury caused by sepsis. While Puerarin was reported to
      attenuate LPS-induced mitochondrial injury in HUVECs, the effects of Puerarin in 
      sepsis-induced myocardial injury remain unclear. In this study, H9C2 cells were
      stimulated with LPS, CCK-8 assays were performed to assess cell viability, and
      flow cytometry and TUNEL staining were used to assess cell apoptosis. Levels of
      ATP, ADP, AMP and enzyme activity were investigated using commercial kits. ROS
      levels in H9C2 cells were detected by flow cytometry. Autophagosomes in the
      mitochondria of H9C2 cells were observed by transmission electron microscope
      (TEM), and protein expression was assessed by western blotting. We found that
      Puerarin significantly reversed LPS-induced decreases in H9C2 cell viability by
      inhibiting apoptosis. The ROS levels in H9C2 cells were significantly upregulated
      by LPS, but that effect was markedly reduced by Puerarin. In addition, Puerarin
      attenuated LPS-induced mitochondrial injury in H9C2 cells by regulating
      dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) and mitofusin 1 (Mfn1). LPS decreased enzyme
      activity and reduced the levels of ADP, ALP, and AMP in mitochondria; however,
      those effects were reversed by Puerarin. Puerarin and Torin1 reversed LPS-induced
      inhibition of autophagy in the mitochondria of H9C2 cells via mediation of p62,
      LC3B, Pink1, and Parkin. Puerarin inhibited LPS-induced H9C2 cell injury by
      inducing mitochondrial autophagy, which acts as a mechanism for preventing
      myocardial injury caused by sepsis.

LID - 10.1007/s12602-022-09966-w [doi]
AB  - Antibiotic resistance is a problem that has been increasing lately; therefore, it
      is important to find new alternatives to treat infections induced by pathogens
      that cannot be eliminated with available products. Small antimicrobial peptides
      (AMPs) known as bacteriocin could be an alternative to antibiotics because they
      have shown to be effective against a great number of multidrug-resistant
      microbes. In addition to its high specificity against microbial pathogens and its
      low cytotoxicity against human cells, most bacteriocin present tolerance to
      enzyme degradation and stability to temperature and pH alterations. Bacteriocins 
      are small peptides with a great diversity of structures and functions; however,
      their mechanisms of action are still not well understood. In this review,
      bacteriocin produced by Bacillus species will be described, especially its
      mechanisms of action, culture conditions used to improve its production and
      state-of-the-art methodologies applied to identify them. Bacteriocin utilization 
      as food preservatives and as new molecules to treat cancer also will be
      discussed.

PG  - 1-8
LID - 10.3724/abbs.2022086 [doi]
AB  - Abnormal metabolism is a major hallmark of cancer and has been validated as a
      therapeutic target. Adenine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), an
      alphabetagamma heterotrimer, performs essential functions in cancer progression
      due to its central role in maintaining the homeostasis of cellular energy. While 
      the contributions of AMPKalpha and AMPKgamma subunits to cancer development have 
      been established, specific roles of AMPKbeta1 and AMPKbeta2 isoforms in cancer
      development are poorly understood. Here, we show the functions of AMPKbeta1 and
      AMPKbeta2 in colon cancer. Specifically, deletion of AMPKbeta1 or AMPKbeta2 leads
      to increased cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, and tumorigenesis
      in HCT116 and HT29 colon cancer cells. Interestingly, the AMPKbeta1 and AMPKbeta2
      isoforms have slightly different effects on regulating cancer metabolism, as
      colon cancer cells with AMPKbeta1 knockout showed decreased rates of
      glycolysis-related oxygen consumption, while AMPKbeta2 deletion led to enhanced
      rates of oxygen consumption due to oxidative phosphorylation. These results
      demonstrate that functional AMPKbeta1 and AMPKbeta2 inhibit growth and
      tumorigenesis in colon cancer cells, suggesting their potential as effective
      targets for colon cancer therapy.

      retinal pigmented epithelium.
PG  - 116
LID - 10.1186/s13578-022-00854-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The degeneration of retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) cells results 
      in severe diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD) that causes
      blindness in millions of individuals. RESULTS: We report that targeting GMP-AMP
      (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) alleviates Alu RNA-induced immune responses and
      cytotoxicity in RPE. We find that the deletion of cGAS in RPE inhibits the Alu
      RNA-stimulated interferon production. cGAS deficiency also protects RPE from cell
      death triggered by Alu RNA. Importantly, two natural chemicals, epigallocatechin 
      gallate (EGCG) and resveratrol (RSVL), are effective in suppressing the
      immunogenic and cytotoxic effect of Alu RNA in RPE. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings
      further demonstrate the crucial role of cGAS in the Alu RNA-induced RPE damage
      and present EGCG and RSVL as potential therapies for AMD and other RPE
      degeneration-related conditions.

AB  - Organisms presumably have mechanisms to monitor and physiologically adapt to
      changes in cellular Na(+) concentrations. Only a single bacterial protein has
      previously been demonstrated to selectively sense Na(+) and regulate gene
      expression. Here we report a riboswitch class, previously called the 'DUF1646
      motif', whose members selectively sense Na(+) and regulate the expression of
      genes relevant to sodium biology. Many proteins encoded by
      Na(+)-riboswitch-regulated genes are annotated as metal ion transporters, whereas
      others are involved in mitigating osmotic stress or harnessing Na(+) gradients
      for ATP production. Na(+) riboswitches exhibit dissociation constants in the low 
      mM range, and strongly reject all other alkali and alkaline earth ions. Likewise,
      only Na(+) triggers riboswitch-mediated transcription and gene expression
      changes. These findings reveal that some bacteria use Na(+) riboswitches to
      monitor, adjust and exploit Na(+) concentrations and gradients, and in some
      instances collaborate with c-di-AMP riboswitches to coordinate gene expression
      during osmotic stress.

TI  - Oncogene addiction to GNAS in GNAS(R201) mutant tumors.
LID - 10.1038/s41388-022-02388-6 [doi]
AB  - The GNAS(R201) gain-of-function mutation is the single most frequent
      cancer-causing mutation across all heterotrimeric G proteins, driving oncogenesis
      in various low-grade/benign gastrointestinal and pancreatic tumors. In this
      study, we investigated the role of GNAS and its product Galphas in tumor
      progression using peritoneal models of colorectal cancer (CRC). GNAS was knocked 
      out in multiple CRC cell lines harboring GNAS(R201C/H) mutations (KM12, SNU175,
      SKCO1), leading to decreased cell-growth in 2D and 3D organoid models. Nude mice 
      were peritoneally injected with GNAS-knockout KM12 cells, leading to a decrease
      in tumor growth and drastically improved survival at 7 weeks. Supporting these
      findings, GNAS overexpression in LS174T cells led to increased cell-growth in 2D 
      and 3D organoid models, and increased tumor growth in PDX mouse models. GNAS
      knockout decreased levels of cyclic AMP in KM12 cells, and molecular profiling
      identified phosphorylation of beta-catenin and activation of its targets as
      critical downstream effects of mutant GNAS signaling. Supporting these findings, 
      chemical inhibition of both PKA and beta-catenin reduced growth of GNAS mutant
      organoids. Our findings demonstrate oncogene addiction to GNAS in peritoneal
      models of GNAS(R201C/H) tumors, which signal through the cAMP/PKA and
      Wnt/beta-catenin pathways. Thus, GNAS and its downstream mediators are promising 
      therapeutic targets for GNAS mutant tumors.

      surveys in Ethiopia and Malawi.
PG  - 443
LID - 10.1038/s41597-022-01500-5 [doi]
AB  - The dataset comprises primary data for the concentration of 29 mineral
      micronutrients in cereal grains and up to 84 soil chemistry properties from
      GeoNutrition project surveys in Ethiopia and Malawi. The work provided insights
      on geospatial variation in the micronutrient concentration in staple crops, and
      the potential influencing soil factors. In Ethiopia, sampling was conducted in
      Amhara, Oromia, and Tigray regions, during the late-2017 and late-2018 harvest
      seasons. In Malawi, national-scale sampling was conducted during the April-June
      2018 harvest season. The concentrations of micronutrients in grain were measured 
      using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Soil chemistry
      properties reported include soil pH; total soil nitrogen; total soil carbon (C); 
      soil organic C; effective cation exchange capacity and exchangeable cations; a
      three-step sequential extraction scheme for the fractionation of sulfur and
      selenium; available phosphate; diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid
      (DTPA)-extractable trace elements; extractable trace elements using 0.01 M
      Ca(NO3)2 and 0.01 M CaCl2; and isotopically exchangeable Zn. These data are
      reported here according to FAIR data principles to enable users to further
      explore agriculture-nutrition linkages.

LID - 10.3390/vetsci9070349 [doi]
AB  - Salmonella Thompson, an important foodborne pathogen, is rarely found to be
      pathogenic to poultry. Accidentally, S. Thompson was found to be pathogenic to
      embryos of white feather broiler at a poultry farm in China. Therefore, this
      study aimed to explore antimicrobial resistance and pathogenicity of clinical S. 
      Thompson isolated from dead poultry embryos. The phylogenetic tree based on 16S
      rRNA and seven housekeeping genes showed that the 14 clinical S. Thompson were
      closely related. The core-genome multilocus sequence typing of 14 clinical S.
      Thompson based on whole-genome sequencing was cgST-12774, consistent with the
      only two strains of S. Thompson from humans in China as reported in the NCBI
      database. The antimicrobial resistance gene analysis demonstrated that all
      strains carried aac(6')-Iaa and the polymyxin resistance gene mcr-9.
      Antimicrobial sensitivity tests for 18 antibiotics showed that S. Thompson
      isolates displayed resistance against streptomycin (100%), ampicillin (35.7%),
      and doxycycline (14.3%), but sensitivity to polymyxin B, proving that the mcr-9
      gene had not appeared resistance phenotype. Virulence genes Salmonella
      pathogenicity island (SPI) SPI1-5, type I fimbriae gene (fimA), flagellar
      assembly genes (bcfC, flhD, fliA, fliC, fljB, flgK, and lpfC), and other
      virulence genes (iroN, pagC, and cigR) were found in each S. Thompson isolate.
      Additionally, the bacterial inoculation experiment with 1-day-old chicks revealed
      that clinical S. Thompson was highly pathogenic to newborn chicks after yolk sac 
      inoculation. This study highlighted that the S. Thompson isolated from poultry
      embryos and the S. Thompson causing human foodborne diarrhea in some parts of
      China belong to the same cgMLST typology (cgST-12774) and showed the
      pathogenicity of this clinical S. Thompson to chicks.

TI  - Enhanced In Vitro Expression of Filaggrin and Antimicrobial Peptides Following
      Application of Glycosaminoglycans and a Sphingomyelin-Rich Lipid Extract.
LID - 323 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/vetsci9070323 [doi]
AB  - Filaggrin is an epidermal protein involved in skin barrier formation and
      hydration, whose expression is altered in canine atopic dermatitis (CAD). CAD
      patients also present an abnormal immune response with an altered expression of
      antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), such as beta-defensins and cathelicidins.
      Sphingolipids and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) have been reported to improve the
      skin barrier in several animal species, including dogs. Our objective was to
      evaluate the in vitro effects of a sphingomyelin-rich lipid extract (LE), a
      hyaluronic acid-rich GAG matrix, and their combination, on the expression of
      filaggrin and human beta-defensin 2 (hBD-2). Filaggrin expression was quantified 
      in a reconstructed human epidermis (RHE), and hBD-2 in normal human epidermal
      keratinocyte (NHEK) cultures. LE and GAGs were tested at 0.02 mg/mL, with or
      without adding a cytokine mix. A significant increase in mean hBD-2, compared to 
      the control (99 pg/mL) was achieved with LE (138 pg/mL) and LE+GAGs (165 pg/mL). 
      Filaggrin increased with GAGs (202% +/- 83) and LE (193% +/- 44) vs. the
      stimulated control, but this difference was statistically significant (p &lt;
      0.05) only with LE+GAGs (210% +/- 39). In conclusion, the tested GAGs and LE
      enhance filaggrin and AMP expression in vitro, which might benefit CAD patients
      if applied in vivo.

TI  - Primary Broiler Hepatocytes for Establishment of a Steatosis Model.
LID - 316 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/vetsci9070316 [doi]
AB  - Fatty liver hemorrhage syndrome (FLHS) in chickens is characterized by steatosis 
      and bleeding in the liver, which has caused huge losses to the poultry industry. 
      This study aimed to use primary cultured broiler hepatocytes to establish a
      steatosis model to explore the optimal conditions for inducing steatosis by
      incubating the cells with a fat emulsion. Primary hepatocytes were isolated from 
      an AA broiler by a modified two-step in situ perfusion method. Hepatocytes were
      divided into an untreated control group and a fat emulsion group that was
      incubated with 2.5, 5, 10, or 20% fat emulsion for different times to determine
      the optimal conditions for inducing steatosis of primary hepatocytes. Incubation 
      of the cells with 10% fat emulsion resulted in cell viability at 48 h of 67%,
      which was higher than the control group and met the requirements of the model. In
      the second experiment, steatosis was induced by incubating hepatocytes with 10%
      fat emulsion for 48 h. In consequence, the apoptosis rate decreased (p &gt; 0.05)
      and the concentration of ALT (p &lt; 0.001), AST (p &lt; 0.01), and TG (p &lt;
      0.05) increased significantly; the expression level of SREBP-1c (p &lt; 0.05)
      increased, and the expression levels of PPARalpha (p &lt; 0.001), CPT1 (p &lt;
      0.001), and CPT2 (p &lt; 0.05) were lower in the fat emulsion group than in the
      control group. In conclusion, the induction condition was selected as 10% fat
      emulsion incubation for 48 h, and we successfully established a fatty liver
      degeneration model for broilers.

TI  - Cadmium Caused Different Toxicity to Photosystem I and Photosystem II of
      Freshwater Unicellular Algae Chlorella&amp;nbsp;pyrenoidosa (Chlorophyta).
LID - 352 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/toxics10070352 [doi]
AB  - Heavy metals such as Cd pose environmental problems and threats to a variety of
      organisms. The effects of cadmium (Cd) on the growth and activities of
      photosystem I (PSI) and photosystem II (PSII) of Chlorella&amp;nbsp;pyrenoidosa
      were studied. The growth rate of cells treated with 25 and 100 microM of Cd for
      longer than 48 h were significantly lower than the control, accompanying with the
      inhibition of photosynthesis. The result of quantum yields and electron transport
      rates (ETRs) in PSI and PSII showed that Cd had a more serious inhibition on PSII
      than on PSI. Cd decreased the efficiency of PSII to use the energy under high
      light with increasing Cd concentration. In contrast, the quantum yield of PSI did
      not show a significant difference among different Cd treatments. The activation
      of cyclic electron flow (CEF) and the inhibition of linear electron flow (LEF)
      due to Cd treatment were observed. The photochemical quantum yield of PSI and the
      tolerance of ETR of PSI to Cd treatments were due to the activation of CEF around
      PSI. The activation of CEF also played an important role in induction of
      non-photochemical quenching (NPQ). The binding features of Cd ions and
      photosystem particles showed that Cd was easier to combine with PSII than PSI,
      which may explain the different toxicity of Cd on PSII and PSI.

TI  - Transcriptome Analysis Reveals the Algicidal Mechanism of Brevibacillus
      laterosporus against Microcystis aeruginosa through Multiple Metabolic Pathways.
LID - 492 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/toxins14070492 [doi]
AB  - It is widely accepted that eutrophication has played an important role in the
      formation of harmful cyanobacterial blooms in recent decades, which impacts water
      quality and ecological environment and causes huge economic losses. Algicidal
      bacteria have a promising application prospect in controlling cyanobacterial
      blooms in aquaculture water. Here, the process of the algicidal bacterium
      Brevibacillus laterosporus strain Bl-zj acting on Microcystis aeruginosa was
      explored using transcriptome analysis to elucidate the algicidal mechanism. The
      results of the co-culture of bacterium and alga showed a strong alga-lysing
      effect of B. laterosporus against M. aeruginosa with an extreme morphology
      deformation of the algal cells. A total of 2744 differentially expressed genes of
      B. laterosporus were identified, which were mainly involved in the metabolism of 
      amino acid, carbohydrate, and lipid. In the co-cultured group, the expression of 
      genes mainly enriched in valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation, and fatty
      acid degradation were significantly increased. However, the expression of the
      genes related to ribosome were mainly inhibited. Transcriptome analysis showed
      that B. laterosporus obtained ATP and energy by the degradation of valine,
      leucine, isoleucine, and fatty acids, and destroyed algal cells by efflux pump
      transporters, secretion of hydrolytic enzymes, antibiotics, proteases, and other 
      secondary metabolites, resulting in algal death and achieving the algicidal
      effect.
